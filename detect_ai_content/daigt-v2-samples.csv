33499,"Title: The Importance of Curfews for Teenagers

As an 8th grader, I believe that enforcing curfews for teenagers who don't get into trouble is a crucial aspect of their development. While some may argue that curfews are restrictive and infringe upon their personal freedom, I strongly believe that they play a significant role in keeping teenagers safe and out of trouble.

Firstly, curfews provide a structured schedule for teenagers, which helps them manage their time effectively. Without a curfew, some teenagers may stay out late and engage in risky behaviors such as drug use, underage drinking, or even criminal activity. By setting a curfew, parents or guardians can ensure that their teenagers are home at a reasonable hour, where they are safer and less likely to get into trouble.

Secondly, curfews promote responsible behavior and independence. By setting boundaries and expectations, parents or guardians can teach their teenagers the importance of being accountable for their actions. When teenagers are given the freedom to come and go as they please, they may take it for granted and engage in risky behaviors that can have serious consequences. By enforcing curfews, parents or guardians can instill a sense of responsibility and accountability in their teenagers, which will benefit them in the long run.

Lastly, curfews can help prevent accidents and injuries. Teenagers who stay out late may be more likely to get into car accidents or engage in other dangerous activities. By setting a curfew, parents or guardians can ensure that their teenagers are home before dark, where they are safer and less likely to get into trouble.

To ensure that teenagers are staying out of trouble, there are several activities and resources that can be implemented. For example, parents or guardians can provide their teenagers with alternative activities and hobbies that are safe and constructive. This can include sports, music, art, or volunteer work, which can help teenagers develop their interests and skills while keeping them out of trouble.

Additionally, parents or guardians can provide their teenagers with access to resources such as counseling",1,Community service,llama2_chat,False
30487,"Sure, here's my essay:

Respect is a fundamental value that is essential in any community or society. It involves treating others with kindness, dignity, and consideration, regardless of their background or beliefs. As an 8th grader, I believe it's crucial to demonstrate respect in various ways, and I'll explain why it's so important.

Firstly, one way to demonstrate respect is by listening actively and empathetically to others. When we listen to someone without interrupting or judging, we show that we value their thoughts and opinions. This helps to build trust and strengthen relationships. For instance, if a classmate is sharing their feelings or ideas, I make sure to give them my full attention and respond thoughtfully. By doing so, I demonstrate that I respect their emotions and opinions, and it creates a more positive and inclusive environment.

Secondly, respect can be shown through nonverbal cues like body language and facial expressions. When we maintain eye contact, use open and relaxed body language, and avoid rolling our eyes or making fun of others, we convey that we value and appreciate them. This is particularly important in social situations, where nonverbal cues can greatly impact how others perceive us. For example, if a classmate is sharing a personal story, I make sure to maintain eye contact and use a supportive expression to show that I'm engaged and empathetic.

Lastly, respect can be demonstrated through small acts of kindness and generosity. When we go out of our way to help someone or show them kindness, it shows that we value their well-being and appreciate their presence in our lives. For instance, if a classmate is struggling with a difficult assignment, I might offer to help them understand the concept or provide additional resources. By doing so, I demonstrate that I respect their learning and want to see them succeed.

In conclusion, respect is a crucial value that we should strive to demonstrate in our daily interactions. By listening actively, using nonverbal cues, and showing kindness and generosity, we can create a more positive and inclusive environment. As an 8th grader, I believe it's important to prioritize respect in my relationships and interactions with others, as it can greatly impact how we",1,Community service,llama2_chat,False

So, like, a 10 p.m. weekday and midnight weekend curfew for teenagers?  That's, like, a pretty big deal, you know? I mean, it's not every day you get to analyze something that affects your freedom, safety, and well-being .

Okay, so let's start with the freedom part.  A curfew can seriously limit our ability to go out and do stuff after a certain time. I mean, think about it. You can't just go to the mall, hang out with friends, or even go to the movies without getting permission from your parents.  It's like, they're trying to control our every move!  And let's be real, sometimes we just want to have some alone time or go to bed whenever we feel like it.

There are, like, crazy people and stuff out there, and you don't want to be the only one walking around by yourself.  Plus, accidents can happen, and it's way better to be inside with your parents than out on the streets.

Well, let me tell you, technology is like a double-edged sword. It can be really helpful and make our lives easier, but if we're not careful, it can also cause some serious problems.

First of all, let's talk about the positive effects of technology.  I mean, think about it, technology has made communication so much easier! With social media, messaging apps, and video calls, we can stay in touch with our friends and family no matter where they are in the world. It's like having a little window into their life, even if we're not right next to them. And let's not forget about all the cool things we can do with technology, like play games, watch movies, and listen to music. It's like having a never-ending supply of entertainment at our fingertips!

26391,"As an 8th grader, I'm excited to research and write about engineering jobs, their requirements, and the skills needed. Engineering is a fascinating field that involves creating innovative solutions to real-world problems. I've always been interested in science and math, and I think engineering could be a great career path for me.

To start, I learned that engineers are problem solvers. They use their knowledge of math, science, and technology to design and develop new products, systems, and infrastructure. Engineers work in various fields, including mechanical, electrical, civil, and computer engineering. Each field has its unique set of challenges and opportunities. For example, mechanical engineers design and develop machines, while electrical engineers work on electrical systems and electronics.

One of the most important requirements for engineers is a strong foundation in math and science. They need to understand the principles of physics, calculus, and other mathematical concepts to solve complex problems. Engineers also need to be creative and have good problem-solving skills. They must be able to think outside the box and come up with innovative solutions to challenging problems.

The day-to-day tasks of an engineer can vary depending on their field and specialty. Mechanical engineers might work on designing and testing prototypes, while electrical engineers might work on developing new electronic devices. Engineers also collaborate with other professionals, such as architects and technicians, to ensure that their designs are safe, efficient, and meet the needs of clients.

One of the biggest benefits of being an engineer is the potential for job stability and financial rewards. Engineers are in high demand, and they can earn good salaries and benefits. They also have the opportunity to work on exciting and challenging projects that make a real difference in the world. For example, environmental engineers work on developing sustainable energy systems and reducing pollution, while aerospace engineers design and develop new aircraft and spacecraft.

However, obtaining and maintaining an engineering job can be challenging. Engineers need to have strong technical skills, but they also need to be able to communicate effectively and work well with others. They must be able to manage complex projects and meet tight deadlines. Engineers also need to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies",1,Facial action coding system,llama2_chat,True
27159,"Okay, here's my attempt at writing an essay as an average 8th grade student:

Hey, guys! Today we're talking about this thing where some schools are thinking about letting students graduate in three years instead of four. Like, I know it might seem cool to get out of school early and start your life, but honestly, I think it's a bad idea.

So, first of all, think about how much stress it would be on students. I mean, we're already trying to balance schoolwork, sports, and hanging out with friends. If we had to cram all that into three years instead of four, it would be crazy! We wouldn't have enough time to do anything, let alone relax and have fun. And let's be real, who wants to be stressed out all the time? Not me, that's for sure!

And then there's the fact that we wouldn't have time for elective classes. Like, I really want to learn how to play the guitar, but we only have like, an hour a week to do it. If we graduated early, we wouldn't have that extra time to explore our interests and figure out what we really want to do with our lives. It's important to have time to explore and try new things, you know?

And what about college preparation? I mean, we're supposed to be getting ready for college, but if we graduate early, we'd have less time to take the SATs, apply to colleges, and all that stuff. It would be super stressful and confusing, and I don't think we'd be as prepared as we need to be.

So, yeah, I think it's better to stick with the traditional four-year graduation plan. It might be longer, but it's worth it in the end. We get more time to relax, explore our interests, and prepare for college. Plus, it's just more fun that way!

That's my opinion, anyway. What do you guys think? Do you think three-year graduation is a good idea, or do you think we should stick with the traditional plan? Let me know in the comments! üòÉ",1,Mandatory extracurricular activities,llama2_chat,False

So, you know how some people say that school is the key to success? Well, I think they're kind of wrong. I mean, sure, it's important to get an education and all, but there are some things that are more important than just getting good grades. Like, have you ever thought about how much money you can make if you drop out of school and start working? Like, seriously, it's a lot. And if you stay in school and finish early, you can start earning money even sooner.

I know some people might say that staying in school is the best option, but let's be real, it's not always easy. Sometimes it's hard to focus in class, and you might not be interested in what the teacher is talking about. And if you're not interested, you're not going to learn anything. And if you don't learn anything, how are you supposed to pass the test? And if you don't pass the test, you might not graduate. And if you don't graduate, you might not get into college. And if you don't get into college, you might not get the job you want.

But, if you drop out of school and start working, you can start earning money right away. You can get a job at a store or restaurant, or even start your own business. And if you work hard, you can make a lot of money. Like, a lot. And you can use that money to buy things you want, like a new phone or a video game console. And you can also save some money for the future, like for college or a car.

Now, I know some people might say that dropping out of school is a bad idea, because it can affect your future. Like, you might not be able to get into college or get a good job if you don't have a diploma. But, I think that's not fair.

""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" - Ralph Waldo Emerson

This quote by Emerson really stood out to me because I can totally relate to it. I know that I've always felt most satisfied and proud of myself when I've pushed myself to do something that's challenging and outside of my comfort zone. Like, I remember last year I decided to join the school's debate team, even though I'd never done anything like it before. It was really scary at first, but I knew that if I wanted to improve my public speaking skills and become more confident, I had to take the leap.

It was definitely hard at first, and I made a lot of mistakes. But with each practice, I started to feel more comfortable and confident. I learned how to organize my thoughts and arguments better, and how to speak more clearly and persuasively. And even though we didn't win the tournament, I still felt like I had accomplished something huge. It was like, I proved to myself that I could do something I never thought I could do, and that felt amazing.

But I can also think of a scenario where I didn't try something challenging, and it definitely didn't end well. Last summer, I was invited to a basketball camp, but I was afraid I wouldn't be good enough and would embarrass myself in front of my peers. So I didn't go, and now I regret it. I know I could have learned so much and grown as a player if I had just taken the chance. Now, I feel like I'm stuck in a rut and I'm not as confident in my abilities as I could be.

So, I think Emerson is totally right. If you don't challenge yourself, you'll never know your full potential. It's scary to try something new and difficult, but the growth and satisfaction you get from it is so worth it. Like, I'm definitely going to keep pushing myself to do things that scare me, even if it means making mistakes along the way.

26674,"Ugh, I don't wanna do this essay. It's so booooring. But, I guess I'll give it a try.

So, the prompt is about how praising students when their work isn't good enough can have both good and bad effects. Like, duh. I mean, it's obvious, right? But, I guess I gotta write about it anyway.

Okay, so the good effects. Praising students when they do good work can make them feel good about themselves and their abilities. It can boost their confidence and motivation to learn and do better. Like, if my teacher gives me a compliment on my math homework, I'm gonna be all, ""Yessss, I'm so smart!"" and then I'll try even harder next time. Makes sense, right?

But, there are also bad effects. When teachers praise students for work that's not up to par, it can create a sense of complacency. Like, if I know I'm gonna get a gold star just for trying, I won't put in as much effort. And then I'll fail, and it'll be all my teacher's fault. Ugh, I hate it when that happens.

And another thing, it can create a culture of competition instead of collaboration. If everyone's just trying to get the praise, then no one's really learning anything. It's like, why bother working hard if everyone's just gonna get a pat on the back anyway? That's not how you learn, you know?

So, in conclusion, praising students when their work isn't good enough can have both good and bad effects. It's important to find a balance between encouraging students and challenging them to do their best. Maybe my teacher can give me a compliment, but also tell me what I need to work on. That way, I'll feel good about myself, but also know what I need to improve. Makes sense, right?

35766,"As an 8th grader, I have been tasked with researching the effects of student population growth on educational institutions in the United States, as well as examining the potential advantages and challenges of distance learning.

Firstly, let's talk about the effects of student population growth on educational institutions. With the population of students constantly increasing, schools are facing a multitude of challenges. For instance, larger class sizes can make it difficult for teachers to give individualized attention to each student, which can negatively impact their learning experience. Additionally, the increased demand for resources such as textbooks, computers, and facilities can put a strain on school budgets, leading to a lack of resources for students.

However, there are also potential advantages to student population growth. With more students enrolled in schools, there is a greater diversity of perspectives and experiences, which can lead to a more engaging and dynamic learning environment. Additionally, schools can benefit from economies of scale when it comes to purchasing resources and hiring staff.

Now, let's move on to distance learning. Taking classes from home can offer a number of benefits for students. For one, it can provide more flexibility in terms of scheduling, as students can take classes at their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, distance learning can be particularly helpful for students who may have difficulty attending classes in person due to issues such as illness or disability.

However, there are also potential challenges to distance learning. One of the biggest drawbacks is the lack of communication between instructors and students. Without regular face-to-face interactions, it can be difficult for students to ask questions or get help when they need it. Additionally, distance learning can be isolating, as students may feel disconnected from their peers and the broader school community.

So, how do the benefits of attending classes at school compare to taking them from home? In my opinion, attending classes at school offers a more well-rounded learning experience. Students can benefit from face-to-face interactions with their instructors and peers, which can lead to a more engaging and dynamic learning environment. Additionally, schools can provide a more structured and organized learning environment, with set schedules and expectations for attendance and participation.

You don't have to worry about, like, getting to school on time or dealing with, like, all the noise and distractions in a traditional classroom. You can just, like, chill at home and learn whenever you feel like it.

And, like, it's not just for students with disabilities, you know? Like, if you're just not feeling super motivated or confident in your schoolwork, distance learning can be a great option. You can, like, take your time and learn at your own pace, without feeling like you're falling behind or whatever. It's like, totally stress-free, you know?

Another thing I think is cool about distance learning is that it's, like, super accessible.

You can just, like, use what you have at home, and it'll be, like, totally fine.

Or you're trying to make new friends, but it's just not happening?  Well, there are these programs in some schools where older students help out the younger ones with stuff like that. It's called ""peer mentoring"" or ""buddy programs,"" and they're pretty cool.

So, here's what I found out: peer mentoring programs pair up older students (usually juniors or seniors) with younger students (like freshmen or sophomores) to help them out with stuff like social adjustment, understanding new classes, and building study habits. The older students act as mentors, kind of like big brothers or sisters, and they help the younger students navigate the school and learn new things. It's like having a friend who's been around the block a few times, you know? 

Now, I know what you're thinking: ""Why do we need these programs? Can't the younger students just figure things out on their own?"" And yeah, some of them probably can. But the thing is, it's not always easy. Like, I know I've had my fair share of struggles in school, and it's nice to have someone to talk to when you're feeling overwhelmed. And that's what these programs provide: a safe space for younger students to ask questions, get help, and make friends. 

So, what are the advantages of these programs? Well, for one, they help younger students feel more comfortable in their new environment. It's like having a buddy to show you around and introduce you to new people. Plus, the older students can give them advice on how to study and manage their time, which can really help with academic achievement.

38531,"As an 8th grader, I have been asked to research the advantages and disadvantages of adopting a curfew law in a city council. At first, I thought it would be easy to write about, but as I dug deeper, I realized it's actually quite complex.

One of the main advantages of a curfew law is that it can increase teenage safety. By setting a specific time for teens to be home, they are less likely to be out late and in dangerous situations. For example, if a teenager is out past curfew, they may be more likely to get into a car accident or get mugged. By having a curfew, parents can rest easy knowing their child is safe at home.

However, there are also some potential disadvantages to a curfew law. One of the biggest concerns is that it restricts teenagers' freedom. Teens need to be able to go out and have fun with their friends, and a curfew law can limit their ability to do so. Additionally, some teens may not have access to transportation, so they may not be able to get home on time even if they want to. This could lead to them getting in trouble with the law or even being stranded.

Another issue with a curfew law is that it doesn't necessarily address the root of the problem. Even if teens are home by curfew, they may still be engaging in risky behavior. By addressing the underlying issues that lead to unsafe behavior, such as lack of supervision or poor decision-making, the law could be more effective.

I think the role of parents in keeping their children safe is huge. If parents are actively involved in their teens' lives and set clear boundaries and expectations, they are less likely to get into trouble. However, not all parents are able to do this, and a curfew law could help fill that gap.

In terms of legal and social implications, a curfew law could be challenged in court. Some argue that it violates teens' rights to freedom of movement and assembly. Additionally, it could lead to racial profiling, as some groups may be more likely to be stopped and questioned by police for breaking the curfew law.

Hey, so I'm pretty good at drawing. Like, really good. I've been drawing since I was a kid, and it's something that I've just naturally gotten better at over the years. I mean, I'm not the best artist in the world or anything, but I'm definitely pretty skilled for an 8th grader.

I remember when I first started drawing, my mom would sit with me and help me hold the pencil and stuff. She'd show me how to make different shapes and lines, and how to blend the colors together. My dad would also give me little drawing projects to do, like drawing a picture of our family dog or something. It was really fun, and it made me want to keep practicing and getting better.

As I got older, I started to realize that drawing was something that I was actually pretty good at. My friends would always be like, ""Wow, your drawings are so cool!"" and stuff, and it made me feel happy and proud. So I just kept practicing and experimenting with different techniques and styles. I'd look at other artists' work and try to figure out how they did things, and I'd try to incorporate those techniques into my own drawings.

But I don't just draw for fun. I also use it to express myself and my feelings. Like, if I'm feeling sad or upset about something, I'll just sit down and start drawing, and it helps me work through my emotions. It's like a way for me to talk without actually having to say anything. And sometimes, my drawings will end up looking really cool and interesting, and that's just an added bonus.

Okay, so let's start with the benefits of having a curfew. Some people say it'll keep us safer, like, if we're out late at night, we might get into trouble or something. And I get that. I don't want to get into any danger either. But, on the other hand, it's not like we're all gonna start robbing banks or something just because we're out after curfew. 

And another thing, a curfew would be super annoying. Like, I like to hang out with my friends and stuff, and if I have to be home by a certain time, it's gonna be super limiting. I mean, I get it, parents wanna know we're safe, but come on, give us some freedom! 

But, on the other hand, there are some pretty good arguments for having a curfew too. For one, it can help us learn responsibility. Like, if we have to be home by a certain time, we have to make sure we get there on time. And that's important, 'cause it'll help us be more responsible in other areas of our lives too. Plus, it can help us avoid things like drugs and alcohol, which are super bad for us.

And let's be real, some of us aren't exactly the most responsible people in the world.  Like, I know I'm not always the most careful person, and a curfew could help me stay out of trouble.

Growing up on the ranch, I always dreamed of seeing what lay beyond the horizon. The wide open range offered freedom and adventure, but part of me longed to explore farther than my trusty steed could carry me. When I heard about the Seagoing Cowboys program, I knew this was my chance to break out of my familiar routines and discover new worlds. Joining was one of the best decisions I ever made.

Trading in my spurs for sea legs opened my eyes to countless wonders. Each new port offered fresh sights, sounds and experiences. I was in awe gazing up at the Sydney Harbour Bridge or wandering through centuries-old streets in Ho Chi Minh City. Nature also astounded me, from whale watching off the California coast to snorkeling the Great Barrier Reef. Each day brought surprises and lessons far from anything I'd know on the range. 

The program also taught me invaluable life skills. On the open ocean, there's no calling for help - you have to work as a team to handle any situation. Through weathering storms and performing maintenance, I gained confidence handling challenges. I also broadened my perspective by living and working closely with people from all over the globe. Our diverse crew felt like a little United Nations, and I returned home with friendships that will last a lifetime.

For anyone seeking adventure beyond their daily routine, I cannot recommend Seagoing Cowboys enough. It offers a chance to break out of your comfort zone and experience the thrill of the unknown. While ranch life is rewarding, this program opened an entire world to me that I may have otherwise never discovered.

I am writing to you regarding your consideration of requiring all students to perform community service. While helping our community is certainly an admirable goal, I do not think mandatory service is the best approach. 

Requiring community service risks having the opposite effect of what is intended. When students are forced to volunteer their time, it becomes less about the desire to help others and more about checking off a box. True community service stems from a student's own passion and commitment to bettering their neighborhood or supporting a cause they care about. If students are obligated to volunteer rather than doing so by choice, the experience is unlikely to teach them an enduring lesson about citizenship.

Instead of a mandate, I think cultivating a culture of voluntary service through leading by positive example would be more effective. Our school could promote the many existing opportunities to volunteer, from assisting at a food bank to mentoring elementary students. Making these options known may inspire more students to get involved out of their own interest, which I believe leads to deeper and more meaningful involvement. 

While I understand the goal of teaching civic responsibility, mandatory service risks feeling punitive instead of purposeful. A student's free time should be their own to spend as they choose, within reason. There are many constructive pursuits beyond volunteering that also build character. For these reasons, I do not think community service should be compulsory for all students. Leading by inspiration, rather than obligation, will foster longer-lasting community engagement.

35580,"Studying Venus Remains Valuable Despite the Risks

The author makes a compelling case that studying Venus remains worthwhile even given the planet's hazardous environment. While Venus presents clear dangers to potential explorers and equipment, the scientific knowledge to be gained justifies facing these risks. 

Several key pieces of evidence support this stance. First, Venus is Earth's sister planet and comparison could yield vital insights into our own world's evolution and climate. Understanding atmosphere dynamics on Venus may illuminate atmospheric processes here. Venus also harbors clues about early solar system processes since conditions there reflect stages Earth experienced long ago. These perspectives are unobtainable elsewhere in the solar system.

Furthermore, robotic missions can progress knowledge without endangering human life. The article notes probes have already analyzed Venus' atmosphere and surface remotely. Data collected shed light on atmospheric chemicals and surface geology, answering some questions while raising new mysteries. Continued unmanned study stands to unravel even deeper secrets. Though probes face reliability issues in Venus' punishing conditions, each safe landing expands comprehension. 

In conclusion, the author presents a cogent argument that pursuing Venus research merits confronting hazards. Our nearest cosmic neighbor promises profound revelations into Earth's past and present. Robotic missions allow advancing understanding without personalk risk. While dangers exist, each successful venture yields returns out of reach on other planets. For the invaluable insights to be gained, braving Venus remains worth the effort. The author thus strongly supports that learning more about Venus remains worthwhile despite the clear dangers involved.",1,Exploring Venus,darragh_claude_v6,True
37049,"I believe summer projects for students should be student-designed rather than teacher-designed for several reasons.  

Allowing students to design their own summer projects empower them to follow their interests and strengths. Different students are motivated by different types of learning experiences. Some may be more engaged by hands-on projects while others excel through reading and writing. By having flexibility in choosing a topic, students are more likely to pick a subject they genuinely want to explore further. This makes the learning experience more meaningful and helps sustain their motivation over the summer break.

In contrast, teacher-designed projects run the risk of being one-size-fits-all assignments that do not accommodate student preferences. When students lack ownership over their work, it becomes just another chore assigned by teachers. This can foster negative attitudes towards learning outside of school. Student-designed projects give students autonomy to pursue subjects they find fascinating through various means such as experiments, visits to museums, interviews with professionals, or book reports. Having a stake in the learning process promotes enthusiasm and curiosity.   

Allowing students to come up with their own summer projects also helps develop important life skills. The experience teaches time management, independence, and problem solving as students map out a plan from beginning to end. They must brainstorm ideas, set goals, troubleshoot obstacles, and organize their work. These are skills that will serve students well beyond school. With teacher-designed projects, students do not have the opportunity to strengthen these abilities in the same way.

In conclusion, for summer learning to be most effective, students should play a role in shaping their projects based on their interests. This empowers students, keeps them engaged, and fosters long-term learning and life skills. As long as there are guidelines for requirements, student-designed projects can ensure students continue to learn and grow over the summer break.",1,Summer projects,darragh_claude_v6,False

I am writing to you regarding the potential policy change that would require students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. After discussing this proposal with many of my classmates, we have several concerns about imposing such a strict grade requirement.

One of the main issues we see is that such a policy may discourage students who are working hard but still achieving C averages. For many students, sports and clubs are important motivators for their academic performance. Taking away that opportunity could discourage students from putting in full effort in their classes. Being part of a team or other activity helps teach important life lessons like time management, dedication, and working with others - skills that aren't always reflected in grades. 

We also worry that this policy may have unintended consequences like increasing stress and competition between students. The desire to get good grades is already a source of anxiety for many. Adding the additional pressure of needing a near-perfect GPA just to be on the baseball team or debate club could worsen that problem. It may also cause students to prioritize grades over other important areas of development like leadership, community service, and personal well-being. 

Rather than an outright ban for C students, we suggest exploring alternative options that still reward academic achievement without excessively punishing those who work hard yet still get average grades. Perhaps limiting the number of sports/activities a C student can participate in, or requiring study sessions, would achieve the goal of emphasis on education without being too restrictive. Overall, we feel the benefits of extracurricular involvement are important for student growth and should not be denied to those committing time and effort, even if the results are not perfect.

I am writing to express my support for keeping the current Electoral College system for electing the President of the United States. While changing to a national popular vote may seem like a more straightforward process, I believe the Electoral College ensures that smaller states still have a meaningful voice in presidential elections.

If we moved to a popular vote system, candidates would have no incentive to campaign anywhere except heavily populated areas. They would focus all their efforts on a handful of major cities and metropolitan regions where the most votes can be found. This could diminish the importance of issues affecting rural communities and smaller states. The current Electoral College system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions and appeal to a wider geographic range of voters. 

It is also important to consider that the United States was founded as a republic of states, not just as a direct democracy. The Founders created the Electoral College as a compromise between election by Congress and election by popular vote. It respects both the federal character of our system of government and the national majority choice. While the national popular vote is one measure of the national consensus, the Electoral College more accurately reflects how the various states contribute to electing the President.

Of course, some argue the Electoral College can result in a President being elected despite losing the nationwide popular vote. However, this has only happened a few times in our history, and many analysts point out it does not necessarily negate the will of the overall electorate. A nationwide popular vote could also encourage recounts and disputes in closer elections. On balance, I believe keeping the current Electoral College system protects the voices of smaller states while still respecting the national popular verdict. For these reasons, I support maintaining our existing Electoral College process.

While driverless cars offer many potential benefits, there are also serious risks that must be addressed before widespread adoption. According to the article, autonomous vehicles could help reduce accidents caused by human error, freeing up time normally spent driving. However, the technology is still in early development and many concerns remain about safety and privacy.  

On the one hand, proponents argue that driverless cars may reduce collisions. The article notes that over 90% of accidents are currently caused by human error factors like distraction, drunkenness or speeding. Without human drivers, autonomous vehicles could communicate quickly to avoid obstacles and follow traffic laws precisely. This could prevent many crashes and save thousands of lives each year. Driverless cars may also provide mobility for those unable to drive, such as the elderly or disabled.

However, opponents raise doubts about the technology's readiness. The software and sensors are extremely complex and not flawless. While continuing to improve, the system could potentially malfunction or be hacked, resulting in unpredictable behavior on public roads. Since the cars require cloud data and GPS, wireless connectivity leaves open risks of cyberattacks. Additionally, some view driverless vehicles as taking away driver control and privacy. Who will be responsible in cases of accident or malfunction? The legal issues surrounding autonomy require considerable debate and oversight.  

In conclusion, while driverless cars offer promising advantages, the technology has not yet proved as safe, secure and well-regulated as required for widespread adoption. More testing and protocols are necessary to address liability concerns before driverless vehicles are rolled out extensively without human oversight. Until the risks are mitigated through further improvements to security, emergency handling and legal framework, a cautious approach of monitored trial systems, rather than fully autonomous vehicles, may be warranted to ensure public safety.",1,Driverless cars,darragh_claude_v6,True

While driverless cars present many potential benefits, developing this new technology also carries signficant risks that need to be addressed before widespread adoption. According to the article, driverless cars could reduce traffic accidents since most accidents are currently caused by human error. Without drivers to make mistakes, collisions may decrease. However, the technology is still new and untested on open roads. There is no guarantee the software will work perfectly in every situation without the situational awareness and decision-making ability of a human. Bugs or flaws in the system could potentially lead to accidents, at least until the technology matures. 

Additionally, the article notes many people will likely feel uneasy riding without a driver at the controls. This presents a potential hurdle to adoption that companies will need to overcome through extensive testing to prove the technology is at least as safe as, if not safer than, human drivers. The software will need to navigate complex scenarios like construction zones and emergency vehicles in a way that feels natural and predictable to passengers. Without addressing these psychological and technological risks, widespread public acceptance and trust in driverless cars could be challenging.

In conclusion, while driverless cars may eventually reduce accidents if designed carefully, the technology has not yet reached a point where it can be guaranteed to perform as well as or better than human drivers in all conditions. Before driverless cars are allowed on public streets without oversight, companies must spend more time testing to prove they can handle unexpected situations securely and in a way that gives passengers peace of mind. The potential benefits of driverless cars are promising, but ensuring safety should remain the top priority as development continues. More testing is still needed before driverless cars are ready for our roads.",1,Driverless cars,darragh_claude_v6,True

I am writing to express my concerns regarding the proposed policy change that would require students to maintain at least a B average in order to participate in sports and extracurricular activities. While I understand the goal of encouraging academic achievement, I believe this type of stringent requirement may end up being counterproductive and punishing for many dedicated, hard-working students. 

Firstly, restricting involvement in sports and clubs could negatively impact students' motivation and mental health. Many students find immense value in ‚Äúafter school‚Äù activities as an outlet for stress relief and a way to build community. Taking this away due to a slightly lower GPA could undermine their confidence and enjoyment of school. It's well known that extracurricular involvement correlates with higher overall wellbeing. 

In addition, a C average does not necessarily indicate a lack of effort or commitment on a student's part. Some students face significant challenges outside the classroom that affect their studies, such as financial hardships, family issues or learning disabilities. A policy like this may end up disproportionately harming those who struggle the most, through no fault of their own. A one-size-fits-all metric like grades does not always capture a student's full work ethic and potential.  

Rather than punishment, I think those with a C average would benefit most from encouragement and supplemental support. Restricting opportunities could have the opposite effect by demotivating them further. A more constructive approach may be to pair students with academic mentors or tutoring programs to help boost struggling areas, allowing them to improve their skills while still engaging in balanced school involvement. This may lead to greater overall achievement in the long run.

In closing, while the intention of encouraging academics is sensible, I believe this particular policy proposal risks more harm than good. A more supportive, nuanced approach that considers individual student needs and circumstances may achieve the same goal in a fairer manner. I hope you will reconsider implementing this change and instead explore alternative options for supporting all students‚Äô holistic development. The wellbeing of the entire student body should be the top priority.

On one hand, it may help teachers understand how their students are processing new information on an individual level. If a teacher notices multiple students express frustration or confusion during a lesson, they could adjust their approach to improve clarity. This technology could also identify instances of bullying or distress that a teacher may otherwise miss, allowing them to intervene more quickly to support students. 

However, constant monitoring of student facial expressions via FACS technology could undermine trust in the classroom and discourage free expression. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing their emotional responses are being analyzed, changing their natural behaviors. There are also risks around student privacy and data security. Detailed emotion readings collected over time could reveal sensitive personal information if accessed by outside parties. Students deserve control over private aspects of their experience at school without being subject to constant electronic surveillance of their feelings.

Overall, using FACS in limited ways with clear communication to students about its purpose and data privacy policies could provide some academic benefits. However, overuse or lack of appropriate safeguards could negatively impact student well-being and the relationships essential to learning. If implemented, facial tracking should respect student consent, privacy, and create as little disruption to the natural classroom dynamic as possible.

As the article ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" outlined, autonomous vehicles present both opportunities and challenges. However, the potential benefits of driverless cars outweigh the risks. If developed responsibly, these groundbreaking technologies could revolutionize transportation and improve safety on our roads. 

Driverless cars have the capacity to significantly reduce accidents caused by human error. As the article notes, over 90% of car crashes are due to human mistakes like distraction, drunk driving, or failure to yield. An artificial intelligence system that never gets tired, intoxicated, or distracted could prevent thousands of collisions and save countless lives each year. Elderly and disabled individuals who can no longer drive themselves would regain their mobility through self-driving options. This promotes accessibility and independence.

Autonomous vehicles could also ease many of today's transportation problems. As mentioned in the article, shared fleets of driverless cars could reduce traffic congestion and the need for parking spaces in dense urban areas. Owners may be able to summon a vehicle on demand rather than keep their own parked car idle much of the time. This lowers environmental impact and opens public space. Autonomous trucks could keep supply chains running efficiently with less manpower. 

Admittedly, developing foolproof artificial intelligence introduces technological risks that developers must address carefully. However, with proper testing and regulations, these challenges are surmountable. Just as seatbelts were met with hesitation but now save over 14,000 lives per year, responsible development of driverless cars could usher in a future with fewer accidents and more transportation options for all. For the benefits of increased mobility, economic opportunity, and public safety, autonomous vehicles should continue advancing through steady, innovative progress guided by safety assessments at each stage.

I am writing to you regarding the school's cell phone policy. After carefully considering both proposed options, I believe Policy 1 is the better choice. There are several reasons why allowing phones during lunch and free periods makes the most sense.

Firstly, restricting phones completely under Policy 2 may end up being difficult to enforce. Teenagers will find ways to sneak phones even if not permitted, which could lead to disciplinary issues. Policy 1 sets clearer boundaries around appropriate phone use so students understand when they can and cannot be on their devices. Fewer behavior problems may result from a policy students view as more fair and reasonable. 

Secondly, many students rely on their phones to stay connected with family after school hours. Policy 1 still allows for this communication during lunch and breaks. For students who walk home alone, bike long distances or take public transportation, checking in with parents via phone provides safety and peace of mind. An outright ban could cause undue worry for some families. 

Finally, occasional but limited phone use as envisioned in Policy 1 helps students prepare for the reality of high school and careers. Most post-secondary schools and workplaces do permit phones to be used during breaks and downtime. Starting this practice in middle school will give students experience abiding by rules similar to what they will see later in life. It teaches moderation and responsibility with devices, valuable skills as technology becomes even more integrated into daily activities.

In conclusion, Policy 1's balanced approach addresses students' needs while still prioritizing learning during class time. I believe it is the policy that best suits our school community. Thank you for considering my recommendation. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

I am writing to you regarding the reconsideration of the school's cell phone policy. After carefully considering both proposed policies, I believe Policy 1 is better for our school. 

While cell phones can be distracting in class, banning them altogether with Policy 2 is too extreme and difficult to enforce. Teenagers today often rely on their phones to communicate with family and friends outside of school. Not allowing phones at all would cause unnecessary frustration. Policy 1 reasonably balances phone use with learning by only permitting phones during free periods like lunch. 

During lunch and passing periods, students should be allowed to check messages and call parents if needed. Completely restricting phone access seems overly controlling. Policy 1 sets clear limits by requiring phones to be powered off in class, so learning isn't disrupted. However, it still gives students some personal freedom and responsibility over their devices between classes.

Policy 1 prepares students for the real world, where cell phones are commonplace but also require appropriate use depending on context. By only allowing phones in non-academic times, it teaches time and place management. Overall, Policy 1 is a fair, moderate policy that respects students' ownership of technology while maintaining an effective learning environment. 

For these reasons, I believe Policy 1 is the better approach and will create a positive culture at our school. It allows natural phone use outside class without compromising academic focus when it matters most. I hope you will consider adopting this policy.

Talking to only one person risks getting a skewed or narrow perspective, whereas getting different viewpoints allows you to gain useful insights from varied experiences and ways of thinking. 

People often specialize in certain areas of knowledge and life experiences based on things like their careers, hobbies, backgrounds, and personal journeys. No single individual can provide a fully holistic or well-rounded perspective on a given situation. Different people naturally have blind spots due to what they don't know or have exposure to. Getting input from multiple trusted sources helps fill in those blind spots by combining diverse skill sets, knowledge bases, and ways of analyzing problems.

Not only do multiple perspectives provide more complete information overall, they can also help validate or challenge certain assumptions. If only one person is consulted, their advice might be unduly influenced by their own implicit or unconscious biases that color how they understand an issue. But getting additional views makes it much less likely for questionable biases or false assumptions to go undetected and unquestioned. Dissenting or alternative opinions prompt deeper critical thinking and consideration of all reasonable factors. 

Perhaps most importantly, hearing different takes on a situation reduces the pressure to come to a perfect conclusion right away. Consulting numerous trusted individuals transforms a high-stakes solitary decision into a communal process of democratic deliberation. This collaborative approach feels less risky and stressful since it doesn't depend entirely on one person's reasoning and advice. It gives space to think issues through fully before committing to the choice that best fits one's true goals, values and circumstances overall based on the consensus of sound counsel received.

Cell phone use while driving has become increasingly common in today's world. However, it presents a significant safety risk and should be banned for all drivers. Using a cell phone while driving, whether it's talking, texting, or otherwise handling the device, is dangerously distracting. A driver's full attention should be on the road in order to safely operate a vehicle and avoid potential accidents. 

Numerous studies show that cell phone use while driving is as dangerous as or worse than drinking and driving. When a driver is distracted even briefly by a cell phone, it takes their focus away from important tasks like monitoring traffic conditions, checking mirrors, and maintaining control of the vehicle. This lack of attention for even a few seconds could result in tragedy if an emergency braking or evasive maneuver is needed. Research also shows cell phone use significantly increases a driver's reaction time, which is crucial in safely avoiding accidents.

Beyond distraction, cell phone use also takes a driver's hands off the wheel and eyes off the road. Texting requires visual attention on the screen instead of what's happening in front of the vehicle. Talking or otherwise handling a phone occupies at least one of a driver's hands, preventing them from fully controlling the car. Distracted driving from cell phone use has been shown to be a leading cause of traffic accidents. Deaths and injuries result from drivers not paying attention due to unnecessary cell phone activities while they are supposed to be focused solely on the road.

Different people often havehad different life experiences that shape their point of view. Getting input from individuals with backgrounds various from your own expands the options andinformation you can take into account. One adviser may notice something another overlooks.

A student experiencing the programs firsthand offers insight into social lifeand workloads the professor lacks. Andparents, wanting the best experience but also value for money, balance financial concernsstudentsand professors may not factor inmuch. No single counselor encompasses everyone's perspective. 

Seeking multiple opinions also prevents getting locked into the viewpoint of just one strong personality. Getting a second or third opinion protects against being swayed by someone with outsized confidence or who pushes their agenda over others.

On one hand, this technology may help teachers gain valuable insights into how their students are feeling and reacting on an individual basis. By identifying when students appear engaged, confused, bored or stressed, teachers could adjust their instruction strategies in real-time to better meet the needs of all learners. This level of personalized attention aimed at optimizing the classroom experience could lead to better educational outcomes overall. The technology may also assist teachers in identifying students who need additional social-emotional support. 

However, this type of constant monitoring of students' facial expressions could also undermine their privacy and psychological well-being. Students may feel uncomfortable or insecure knowing that software is constantly analyzing their emotional state without their consent or control. This loss of privacy may inhibit natural student expression and diminish the psychosocial safety of the learning environment. Students could become reluctant to openly grapple with difficult concepts if they feel their emotional reactions are being watched and judged. Some may adopt artificial faces that signal engagement even when they are confused or checked-out. 

Overall, while FACS technology aimed at improving education has potential benefits, its use in classrooms requires strict privacy protections and ethical guidelines to avoid unintended harms. Students' consent and well-being should be the top priority over data collection. And any insights gained from the technology would need to be handled sensitively by trained teachers rather than just flagged as metrics. With proper safeguards and limitations, emotional tracking tools could enhance learning experiences. But left unchecked, they risk compromising what should be a safe space for students to freely explore new ideas.",1,Facial action coding system,darragh_claude_v6,True
26008,"Driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize transportation, but also pose serious risks that require careful consideration. While autonomous vehicles could reduce accidents and congestion, ensuring public safety should be the top priority as this new technology is developed.

One benefit mentioned in the article is that driverless cars could significantly decrease accidents caused by human error. Without distracted or impaired humans behind the wheel, autonomous vehicles may drive more cautiously and avoid collisions. This safety aspect seems promising. However, the technology is still in early stages and not proven on a mass scale. Software or mechanical glitches could potentially cause accidents that autonomous systems may not be able to prevent or cope with as well as an alert human. Before driverless cars are allowed independently on public roads, extensive testing and regulations must demonstrate they can drive as securely as human drivers in all conditions. 

In addition to safety concerns, privacy issues could arise from the sensors and data collection used in autonomous vehicles. The article notes cars may record and transmit people's movements, conversations, and other personal information without consent. This type of constant surveillance poses risks if data are not adequately protected or used responsibly. Strict privacy laws and oversight would be needed to address such concerns and maintain public trust in the technology.

While driverless cars show potential to transform travel, ensuring public safety should be the top priority as development continues. More research is prudent before allowing autonomous vehicles on roads without human drivers ready to take control if needed. With adequate testing, regulations, and privacy protections put in place, driverless cars may eventually ease congestion and reduce road deaths. However, until autonomous vehicle technology proves as safe as or safer than human drivers in all conditions, the risks likely outweigh the benefits. Progress should continue carefully and gradually with safety as the guiding principle.",1,Driverless cars,darragh_claude_v6,True
39123,"Drivers Should Not Use Cell Phones While Operating a Vehicle

Cell phone use while driving has become an epidemic in today's world. With the rise of smartphones, it is more tempting than ever for drivers to check emails, texts, and social media while on the road. However, the dangers of distracted driving from cell phone use are clear. Numerous studies have shown that drivers who use their phones, even with hands-free technology, have slower reaction times, are less aware of their surroundings, and are more likely to crash. For these reasons, drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a moving vehicle. 

Texting while driving in particular is extremely dangerous as it takes a driver's eyes off the road for prolonged periods of time. Texting leads to a 400% increase in time spent not looking at the road. Even short distractions can have catastrophic consequences at high speeds. Every day, around nine people are killed and more than 1,000 injured in crashes that involved distracted driving. The risks of even hands-free calling are unacceptable when human lives are at stake with each drive.

Banning all cell phone use, including hands-free, while driving sends a consistent message that operating a vehicle demands a driver's full attention. Partial bans are confusing and hard to enforce. Drivers may still feel permitted to check notifications or have brief conversations even if hands-on use is forbidden. Laws should not just discourage the most dangerous behaviors like texting, but target the root cause of distraction. A studies even show that driving performance is impacted for several minutes after use of voice-command dialing or hands-free modes due to delayed cognitive distraction. 

In an increasingly wireless world, it may seem restrictive to ban all cell phone activity behind the wheel. However, public safety must come before personal convenience. As vehicles became more complex with added infotainment and connectivity features, distraction risks will only increase without comprehensive bans that futureproof road safety. For the protection of all citizens that share the roads each day, no cell phone use of any kind should be permitted while operating a motor vehicle. Lives depend on drivers paying complete attention to the critical task of navigating traffic safely. A total cell phone ban achieves that goal most effectively.",1,Phones and driving,darragh_claude_v6,False
28721,"Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to express my views on the possible policy change that would require students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While I understand the goal of wanting students to focus on their academic performance, I do not think tying participation to grades is the right approach. 

There are a few key reasons I believe this proposed policy should not be implemented. First, requiring a B average would discourage students who are working hard but still earning Cs from being involved in the school community. Extracurricular activities are important for students' social and emotional development, and help promote school spirit and pride. Barring students who are doing their best but struggling a bit academically would take that away from them. 

Second, participation in sports and clubs can actually help students' academic performance rather than hinder it. Being engaged in the school through extracurriculars gives students a reason to care more about their classes and come to school. It also teaches valuable skills like time management, responsibility, and working as part of a team - abilities that serve students well inside the classroom too. 

Finally, a policy based on grades may unfairly impact certain groups more than others. Students taking harder classes aimed at preparing them for college could see their GPAs suffer through no fault of their own. The same could be said for students who struggle with particular subjects like math or who have undiscovered learning differences. Excluding these devoted, hard-working students from activities could damage school morale.

In conclusion, while grades are important, I do not think they should determine a student's ability to be involved in the life of the school. Extracurricular activities provide too many benefits to simply bar access to them based on a GPA cutoff. I encourage you to reconsider this proposed policy change. Please let me know if you would like me to further explain my perspective.

Thank you for your consideration.

Firstly, a curfew can have an especially positive effect on families. Teenagers have curfews set in place, families can feel more secure that their children are in safe environments and are not engaging in risky activities. Curfews can also help to ensure that children are completing their homework and getting adequate rest, leading to positive relationships between families. 

Local government can also benefit from the enforcement of curfews for teens. By requiring teenagers to be in their homes by a certain time of night, this decreases the chances of teens participating in illegal activities, such as underage drinking and drug use. Similarly, it helps to decrease traffic related incidents which can have considerable impacts on a local community. 

The positive impacts of enforcing curfews for teenagers can also be felt more broadly in society. As teens have a greater sense of structure and security, this encourages stronger communities to form within a society. Curfews can also help to ensure that teens are not disrupting their local neighborhoods with loud music or unruly behavior after dark. 

Finally, enforcing curfews for teens can have positive impacts for schools. As teens comply with a curfew, this ensures that they are able to attend school on time and refreshed and are better able to focus and achieve their academic goals. Additionally, setting a curfew can help to promote a positive school culture that promotes respect and encourages teens to take their studies and future goals seriously. 

In conclusion, the enforcement of curfews for teenagers can have a range of positive impacts, from a more secure family environment to a stronger school culture.

28384,"In modern society, it has become a common mindset that one should continually grow and strive for more than what they currently have. This mentality is often indicative of strong ambition and personal drive, as wanting to move forward and pursue more is seen as a positive attribute. While some may argue that it is possible to maintain a status quo and have a fulfilling life, it is essential to continue growing and pushing the boundaries of our capabilities in a variety of ways.

Continuing to grow and strive for more beyond what you have achieved can lead to positive outcomes, such as increased confidence in oneself and the ability to tackle increasingly difficult tasks. Utilizing existing successes as motivation and fuel for success can propel one closer to their goals. Additionally, growth can come in the form of experiences or knowledge, as gaining new perspectives and skills could lead to a more successful future.

On the other hand, stagnation and resistance to growth can be limiting. In the absence of ambition or goals, individuals may lack the direction necessary to lead a productive life. Allowing oneself to become too comfortable with their current accomplishments and refusing to pursue more can lead to a lack of purpose or joy in their life. Without continual growth, it can become easy to become complacent with one‚Äôs achievements and fail to recognize potential to strive for greater heights.

Overall, continuing to grow and strive beyond what one has achieved is an important component for a successful life.

The courses they take, the skills that they develop, the support they receive, and the legacy they leave are all powerful influences on their careers. 

The courses students take in high school provide them with skills that are essential to any future career they chose. Students are exposed to a range of academic and practical topics, which develop their knowledge and abilities. For example, the language courses help students to build their communication skills and the science classes can provide the knowledge they need for a career in medicine or engineering. The courses and activities students undertake in high school provide a rich educational experience that can help them to determine what kind of career they want to pursue.

Parental support can play a critical role in a student‚Äôs future career. Parents can offer guidance and advice to help their children make the right decisions. They can help students to understand their strengths and weaknesses and to explore different options that are available. This support can make it easier for students to make the right choices for their future. 

The school staff, such as teachers and counselors, can also play an important role in helping students to consider their future career. These professionals can provide valuable guidance and insight about the options available to students and can be a great source of support. 

Finally, students can be motivated to consider their future career by leaving a legacy. The goal of leaving a positive impression on their school and peers can be a powerful motivator. It is also important to note that this legacy may remain long after students graduate, providing them with an ongoing source of inspiration and pride.

After conducting research, it is evident that there are several underlying reasons why students don't like school lunch. Firstly, the quality and the presentation of the food are often subpar; moreover, many school cafeterias lack variety and offer the same selections of meals every day, causing students to develop an aversion to the food. Additionally, the taste is often an issue, as the cafeteria food is usually not very flavorful and for many students, it is not enjoyable to eat. Furthermore, many students are concerned with the nutrition and safety of the cafeteria food.

To make the school cafeteria more appealing to students, the first step is to improve the quality of the food. The menus should be regularly reviewed and changed to make sure that there is enough variety for the students. Schools should also invest in hiring experienced chefs to provide meals that are both nutritious and tasty. Additionally, schools should focus on improving the presentation of the food, as this may make them more attractive and more appetizing to students.

First and foremost, graduating a year early can have a negative impact on a student's academic performance. High school is a time of great change and development, and students need to be challenged and engaged in order to reach their full potential. If students are allowed to graduate early, they may not be given the same level of academic rigor and support as they would have received if they had stayed in school for another year.

Additionally, graduating early can lead to a lack of maturity and readiness for the next stage of life. High school is a time for students to learn important life skills and develop their sense of self. If students are rushed through this process, they may not have the same level of emotional and intellectual maturity as they would have had if they had stayed in school for another year.

Furthermore, graduating early can also lead to a lack of financial stability. Many students who graduate early may not have the same level of financial support as they would have had if they had stayed in school for another year. This can lead to financial difficulties and make it harder for them to achieve their goals.

In conclusion, while it may seem like a good idea to let high school kids graduate early, there are several reasons why this should not be allowed.

Competition and being a competitive person are important in many aspects of life. It is a driving force that motivates individuals to strive for excellence and push themselves to their limits. Being competitive can be a double-edged sword, however. On one hand, it can help individuals achieve their goals and become successful. On the other hand, it can also lead to negative behaviors such as jealousy and resentment.

My own experience of having an older brother who fostered my competitive spirit has helped to shape my understanding of this concept. Growing up, my brother was always pushing me to be better and to strive for greatness. He would challenge me in every way possible, from sports to academics. This competition helped me develop a strong work ethic and a desire to succeed.

In my own life, I have channeled my competitive spirit by setting high goals for myself. For example, my aspiration to become a pro basketball player serves as a reminder of the importance of being competitive. I know that in order to achieve this goal, I must work hard, push myself to my limits, and constantly strive for improvement.

It is important for others to channel their competitive spirit in an effective manner as well. This means setting realistic goals, working hard, and focusing on personal growth. It also means being mindful of the negative behaviors that can arise from competition, such as jealousy and resentment. Instead of focusing on the success of others, individuals should focus on their own progress and growth.

In conclusion, competition and being a competitive person are important in many aspects of life. It can help individuals achieve their goals and become successful, but it can also lead to negative behaviors if not channeled effectively. By setting realistic goals, working hard, and focusing on personal growth, individuals can channel their competitive spirit in a positive and effective manner.",1,Seeking multiple opinions,mistral7binstruct_v1,False

I believe that attending school in person is more beneficial for students than taking online classes. While online classes offer flexibility and convenience, they also come with their own set of challenges that can make it difficult for students to stay motivated and engaged. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why students should come to school instead of taking online classes, including procrastination, distractions, and responsibility.

Procrastination is a common problem for students, and it can be even more challenging when taking online classes. Without the structure of a traditional classroom, students may struggle to stay on track with their coursework. They may also face distractions from social media, TV, or other activities, which can make it difficult to focus on their studies. In contrast, attending school in person provides a more structured environment that can help students stay focused and motivated. They can also benefit from the accountability of having a teacher and classmates to keep them on track.

Distractions can also be a significant challenge for students taking online classes. While online classes offer flexibility, they also require a lot of self-discipline and self-motivation. Without the support of a teacher and classmates, students may struggle to stay focused on their studies. In contrast, attending school in person provides a more structured environment that can help students stay focused and motivated. They can also benefit from the support of their peers and teachers, who can provide guidance and encouragement when needed.

Finally, responsibility is an essential aspect of attending school in person. When students attend school, they are expected to be present and engaged in their studies. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, organization, and accountability. In contrast, taking online classes can make it easier for students to procrastinate and miss deadlines. They may also struggle to take responsibility for their own learning, which can make it difficult for them to succeed in their coursework.

One of my friends had a negative experience with online classes. They found it challenging to stay motivated and engaged, and they struggled with procrastination and distractions. They also missed out on the support and guidance of their teachers and classmates, which made it difficult for them to succeed in their coursework. In contrast, when they returned to attending school in person, they found it much easier to stay focused and motivated. They also benefited from the",1,Distance learning,mistral7binstruct_v1,False
35197,"In recent years, there has been a growing debate on whether schools should extend their school day by two hours. While some argue that this would be beneficial to students' wellbeing and learning outcomes, others believe that it would have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore both sides of the argument and provide my own perspective on the matter.

On one hand, proponents of extending the school day argue that it would provide students with more time to learn and improve their academic performance. By having more time in the classroom, students would be able to complete more assignments, ask more questions, and receive more individualized attention from their teachers. Additionally, having more time in the classroom could also help to reduce the stress and pressure that students often feel during the school day. This would allow them to focus more on their studies and less on their personal problems, which could ultimately lead to better academic performance.

On the other hand, opponents of extending the school day argue that it would have negative consequences for students' wellbeing. By keeping students in the classroom for longer periods of time, they would be at risk of experiencing burnout and exhaustion. This could lead to decreased motivation, reduced engagement, and ultimately, lower academic performance. Additionally, extending the school day could also put a strain on students' families, who would have to find alternative childcare arrangements. This could be especially difficult for families with limited financial resources or who have other responsibilities outside of the home.

In my opinion, the benefits of extending the school day do not outweigh the potential negative consequences. While it is important for students to have access to more time in the classroom, it is also important to consider their wellbeing and the impact that this could have on their academic performance. Instead of extending the school day, schools should focus on providing students with more support and resources to help them succeed in their studies. This could include additional tutoring, mentoring, and other forms of individualized attention. By prioritizing students' wellbeing and providing them with the support they need to succeed, schools can help to create a more positive and productive learning environment for all students.

In conclusion, the debate on whether to extend the school day by two hours is a complex one. While proponents argue that it would be beneficial to students' wellbeing and learning outcomes, opponents argue that it would have negative consequences.

38651,"Taking classes online has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it's no surprise that many students are considering this option when pursuing higher education. While there are certainly advantages to online learning, there are also some drawbacks that students should be aware of. In this essay, I will examine the pros and cons of taking classes online from the perspective of a student who wishes to pursue higher education.

One of the biggest advantages of taking classes online is the flexibility that it offers. Students can complete their coursework at their own pace, which is especially beneficial for those who have other commitments, such as jobs or families. This flexibility also allows students to attend classes from anywhere, which can be particularly convenient for those who live far from a traditional campus.

Another advantage of online learning is the ability to access a wider range of courses. Many universities and colleges offer a limited selection of courses on their campuses, but students can take virtually any course they want online. This means that students can pursue their interests and passions, even if those interests are not available on their local campus.

Despite these advantages, there are also some drawbacks to taking classes online. One of the biggest disadvantages is the lack of face-to-face interaction with instructors and classmates. Online learning can be isolating, and students may miss out on the social connections and support that come with attending classes in person.

Another disadvantage of online learning is the potential for distractions. With online classes, students need to have a lot of self-discipline in order to complete their coursework. This can be difficult for some students, who may struggle to stay focused and motivated without the structure of a traditional classroom.

In conclusion, taking classes online has its pros and cons. While it offers flexibility and access to a wider range of courses, it can also be isolating and difficult to stay motivated without face-to-face interaction. Ultimately, the decision to take classes online should be based on the individual needs and preferences of the student. Students who value flexibility and convenience may find online learning to be the best option for them, while those who prefer a more traditional classroom experience may be better off attending classes on a traditional campus.",1,Distance learning,mistral7binstruct_v1,False
33498,"Working with a group or alone is a common debate among individuals. Some people believe that working with a group is more beneficial than working alone, while others believe that working alone is more beneficial. In this essay, I will analyze and discuss the merits and drawbacks of working in a group and working alone. I will also evaluate when each is more beneficial and why.

Working in a group can be beneficial in many ways. Firstly, working with a group can provide a sense of community and support. When working with others, individuals can share ideas, collaborate on tasks, and provide feedback to one another. This can lead to a more productive and efficient work environment. Additionally, working in a group can provide opportunities for learning and growth. When working with individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, individuals can gain new perspectives and ideas. This can lead to personal and professional growth.

However, working in a group also has its drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is the potential for conflicts and disagreements. When working with a group, individuals may have different opinions and ideas, which can lead to disagreements and conflicts. This can be detrimental to the group's productivity and efficiency. Additionally, working in a group can be less flexible than working alone. When working alone, individuals have more control over their work schedule and can work at their own pace. This can be beneficial for individuals who have different working styles and preferences.

On the other hand, working alone can also have its benefits. Firstly, working alone can provide more control and autonomy over one's work. When working alone, individuals have more control over their work schedule, work environment, and work style. This can be beneficial for individuals who have different working styles and preferences. Additionally, working alone can be more efficient and productive. When working alone, individuals can focus solely on their work without the distractions of others. This can lead to a more focused and productive work environment.

However, working alone also has its drawbacks. One of the main drawbacks is the potential for isolation and loneliness. When working alone, individuals may feel isolated and disconnected from others. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and depression. Additionally, working alone can be less efficient and productive in certain situations. When working on complex projects that require collaboration and teamwork, working alone may not be the most beneficial approach.

39633,"Title: The Pros and Cons of Extending the School Day

Introduction

The school board has recently proposed an additional hour and a half to the school day. While this may seem like a great idea, it is important to consider the pros and cons of this proposal. In this essay, we will explore the impact of this proposal on how much time students have for their activities outside of school, the effect on their routine, and the amount of time available to complete their homework at home.

Pros of the Proposal

One of the main benefits of extending the school day is that it would provide students with more time to complete their homework. With an additional hour and a half, students would have more time to work on their assignments and study for exams. This would ultimately lead to better grades and a higher level of understanding of the material.

Another benefit of the proposal is that it would give students more time to participate in extracurricular activities. Many students have to balance schoolwork with other commitments, such as sports or music. With an additional hour and a half, students would have more time to participate in these activities and develop their skills outside of the classroom.

Cons of the Proposal

One of the main drawbacks of the proposal is that it would take away time from students' activities outside of school. With an additional hour and a half, students would have less time to spend with their friends and family, go to the gym or participate in hobbies. This could lead to a decrease in their overall happiness and well-being.

Another concern is that the proposal could disrupt students' routines. Many students have a set schedule for their day, including when they wake up, eat breakfast, and go to bed. With an additional hour and a half, this routine could be thrown off, leading to confusion and stress.

Argument

In my opinion, the benefits of the proposal outweigh the drawbacks. While it is important to have time for activities outside of school, the additional time would ultimately lead to better grades and a higher level of understanding of the material. This would ultimately benefit students in the long run. Additionally, the proposal would provide students with more time to participate in extracurricular activities, which would help them develop their skills and interests outside of the classroom.

While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

On one hand, taking one day off of school can provide students with much-needed rest and relaxation. This can lead to increased productivity and focus when they return to class, as well as improved mental and physical health. Moreover, a day off can give students a chance to catch up on any work they may have fallen behind on, or to pursue extracurricular activities that they may not have had time for otherwise.

However, taking one day off of school can also have negative consequences. Teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload that results from a school day off, such as grading papers, preparing for upcoming lessons, and communicating with students and parents. This can lead to increased stress and burnout, as well as a potential decrease in the quality of instruction.

Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear. While students and teachers may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, the impact on the environment and the school's resources may be minimal. This is particularly true if the school is already operating efficiently and using energy-efficient technologies.

In conclusion, taking one day off of school can have both positive and negative effects on students and teachers. While students may appreciate the extra day to rest and recharge, teachers may struggle to keep up with the workload and maintain a consistent schedule. Additionally, the energy and resource savings that result from a school day off may not be as significant as they appear.

34164,"Ralph Waldo Emerson was an American essayist, philosopher, and poet who lived in the 19th century. He is known for his advocacy of individualism and self-reliance. One of his most famous quotes is ""Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail."" This quote reflects Emerson's belief in the importance of being true to oneself and not conforming to societal expectations.

Being oneself is significant because it allows individuals to live authentically and to express their true selves. When people try to become someone else, they often lose touch with their own values and beliefs, and may even compromise their integrity. This can lead to feelings of emptiness and dissatisfaction with life.

Trying to become someone else to get a job can be unsuccessful because employers value authenticity and individuality. They want to hire people who are passionate about their work and who bring something unique to the table. When people try to fit into a mold or conform to someone else's expectations, they may not be able to show their true potential or stand out from the competition.

Some people value material goods over important values, such as authenticity and self-expression. This can lead to a culture that places too much emphasis on conformity and not enough on individuality. Emerson believed that this was a dangerous trend, and that people should prioritize their own values and beliefs above all else.

Life is short, and it is important to live it authentically. When we try to become someone else, we may lose sight of what truly matters in life. Emerson's message to live authentically and to be true to oneself is still relevant today, and is a reminder to prioritize our own values and beliefs above all else.",1,Seeking multiple opinions,mistral7binstruct_v1,False

While some people believe that early graduation is a great way to get ahead in life, others argue that it can have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of graduating from high school early and how it may affect future college and job prospects.

On the one hand, graduating from high school early can be a great way to get ahead in life. It can open up new opportunities and allow individuals to pursue different and new courses of study. For example, if someone graduates early, they may be able to take college courses while still in high school, which can help them get a head start on their future. Additionally, early graduation can help individuals save money on tuition and fees, as they can start college sooner.

On the other hand, graduating from high school early can also have negative consequences. One of the main concerns is that it can limit the number of elective courses that students can take. This can be especially problematic for students who are interested in pursuing a particular area of study or who want to explore different interests. Additionally, early graduation can limit the amount of relaxation and vacation time that students have. This can be stressful and may negatively impact their mental health.

Another potential downside of early graduation is that it can be more difficult to find a job. While some employers may be impressed by an early graduation, others may view it as a negative. This is because employers often look for well-rounded individuals who have taken the time to explore different interests and pursue a variety of activities outside of school.

In conclusion, graduating from high school early can have both positive and negative consequences. While it can open up new opportunities and help individuals save money on tuition, it can also limit the number of elective courses that students can take and limit the amount of relaxation and vacation time they have.

In terms of employment prospects, Generic_City has a growing economy, with various industries such as manufacturing, tourism, and IT. However, the competition is fierce, and many jobs require advanced skills and education. The unemployment rate is high, especially for young people and those without a college degree.

The education system in Generic_City is also a concern. While there are some good schools, the quality of education varies greatly depending on the neighborhood and socioeconomic status of the students. Many schools lack adequate resources, such as textbooks, computers, and qualified teachers. As a result, many students struggle to keep up with their studies and achieve their full potential.

The government leadership in Generic_City is also a topic of discussion. While there are some good leaders who are committed to improving the lives of their citizens, corruption and political instability are prevalent. This makes it difficult for businesses to operate and for citizens to access basic services such as healthcare and education.

Cultural differences between Generic_City and the United States are also significant. Language barriers are a common issue, with many people in Generic_City speaking languages other than English.

In his essay ""Self-Reliance,"" Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasizes the importance of these values, and I believe that his message is still relevant today.

Firstly, Emerson argues that having experiences is essential for personal growth. He believes that people who only rely on books and theories will never truly understand the world around them. Instead, they must go out and experience life for themselves. This means taking risks, trying new things, and embracing challenges. By doing so, individuals can gain a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.

I agree with Emerson that having experiences is crucial for personal growth. I have learned so much about myself and the world through my various experiences, both good and bad. For example, when I started working at a local restaurant, I was nervous and unsure of myself. However, as I gained more experience, I became more confident and comfortable in my role. I also learned how to work effectively with others and how to handle difficult situations. These experiences have helped me to become a more well-rounded and resilient person.

Secondly, Emerson argues that being responsible towards a job is essential for personal growth. He believes that people who take their work seriously and are accountable for their actions will be more successful in life. This means being punctual, reliable, and committed to one's job. It also means taking ownership of mistakes and learning from them.

I agree with Emerson that being responsible towards a job is essential for personal growth. When I started working at the restaurant, I was not always responsible for my actions. However, as I gained more experience and took my work more seriously, I became more accountable for my actions. I learned how to manage my time effectively, how to prioritize tasks, and how to work collaboratively with others. These skills have helped me to become a more responsible and successful person in all areas of my life.

In conclusion, I believe that having experiences and being responsible towards a job are crucial aspects of personal growth and development.

While it may seem like a simple solution to allow students to use their phones during these times, there are several factors that must be considered before making a decision.

On the one hand, allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time can have several benefits. For one, it can help students stay connected with their friends and family, especially during times when they may not see each other often. Additionally, it can provide students with a way to pass the time and stay entertained during free periods, which can help to alleviate boredom and improve their overall mood. Furthermore, it can also allow students to access important information and resources, such as study materials or homework assignments, which can help them to stay on top of their work.

On the other hand, there are also several drawbacks to this policy. For one, allowing students to use their phones during lunch and free time can be a major distraction, and can prevent students from focusing on their work or engaging in meaningful conversations with their peers. Additionally, it can also lead to a decrease in social skills and a lack of face-to-face interaction, which can have negative effects on students' overall development. Furthermore, it can also create a safety concern, as students may be more vulnerable to cyberbullying or other forms of online harassment when they are not supervised.

While some may argue that this is a shortcut to a college education, I believe that there are several benefits to graduating high school early. Additionally, pursuing a college education after graduating high school can provide even more benefits to individuals.

Firstly, graduating high school after three years allows individuals to enter the workforce sooner. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are eager to start their careers and begin earning a salary. By entering the workforce early, individuals can gain valuable experience and start building their professional network. This can be particularly beneficial for those who are pursuing careers in fields that require hands-on experience, such as construction or manufacturing.

Secondly, graduating high school early can also provide individuals with the opportunity to pursue higher education at a younger age. While some may argue that this is a shortcut to a college education, I believe that it can actually be an advantage. By pursuing higher education at a younger age, individuals can take advantage of financial aid and scholarships that may be available to them. Additionally, they can gain a head start on their college degree, which can help them stand out to potential employers in the future.

Pursuing a college education after graduating high school can also provide individuals with a wide range of benefits. Firstly, a college education can provide individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in their chosen field. Many college programs offer hands-on training and practical experience that can be difficult to gain through other means. Additionally, a college education can provide individuals with access to a network of professionals and resources that can help them advance in their careers.

28021,"As an eighth-grade student, I believe that Winston Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm"" is a very accurate and inspiring quote. In today's fast-paced world, it's easy to get discouraged by setbacks and failures, but Churchill's words remind us that success is not defined by how many times we fail, but by how we respond to those failures.

First of all, Churchill's quote emphasizes the importance of enthusiasm in achieving success. Enthusiasm is the driving force behind any successful endeavor. Without it, we are more likely to give up when faced with obstacles and setbacks. Enthusiasm helps us to stay motivated and focused on our goals, even when things get tough. It's what keeps us going when we feel like quitting.

Furthermore, Churchill's quote reminds us that failure is a natural part of the journey to success. We all experience setbacks and disappointments in our lives, but it's how we respond to those failures that defines our character and determines our success. Instead of getting discouraged by failure, we should view it as an opportunity to learn and grow. We can use our failures as stepping stones to achieve greater success in the future.

Finally, Churchill's quote teaches us that success is not a destination, but a journey. It's not about reaching a specific goal or achieving a certain level of success, but about the process of striving towards our goals and never giving up. Success is a continuous journey, and we must be willing to embrace both our successes and our failures as part of that journey.

In conclusion, I believe that Winston Churchill's statement ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm"" is a very inspiring and accurate quote.

These subjects are crucial for students to develop a strong foundation in critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills, which are essential for success in college and beyond. In addition, many high school students already have a strong interest in these subjects and may choose to pursue them outside of school, such as through extracurricular activities or private lessons.

Secondly, many high school students may not have a natural talent or interest in music, art, or drama. Forcing these students to take these classes may result in a negative experience and discourage them from pursuing their passions. Instead, students should be given the opportunity to choose their own classes based on their interests and strengths.

Finally, there is no evidence to suggest that music, art, and drama classes are directly related to academic success or future career prospects. While these subjects may be valuable for personal development and self-expression, they do not necessarily translate into practical skills or knowledge that are in demand in the workforce.

In conclusion, while music, art, and drama classes may be important for personal development and self-expression, they are not essential for academic success or future career prospects. High school students should be given the opportunity to choose their own classes based on their interests and strengths, and resources should be allocated towards core subjects such as math, science, and language arts.",1,Distance learning,mistral7binstruct_v1,False
16749,"Based on what I have read o do not think self riving cars should be allowed. The law is right based on what they say these cars eventhough they have sensos to make the driver aware of situations in need of a human. The person in the car may become to focused on what they are doing and ignore the sensor. The idea of self driven cars is too risky. Even though they are going for safety a car cant drive like a human or have the response time of a human and even computers make mistakes.

Even in a simple GPS they tend to make mistakes often. So what happens if the cars GPS is off on its calculations and the car drives through a house. Will they blame that on the driver. I would hope not. It shouldnt be the drivers mistake if the car messes up. You cant always rely on computers.

So no I highly disagree with this. Computers arent perfect, and there are just some things only humans can do. Driving might just be one of those things.

15048,"Dear Principal,

I think that you shouldn't make all students do community service. Because maybe some of us want to do other things. Or maybe some of us have to do other things like homework or baby sit. To me not all the time students are going to want to do community service. Because if it were me I wouldn't want to do community service myself either. I TRUELY know that helping the community is important. But don't you think that our own time is important too? I'm not trying to be selfish with my time. If you really do think about it then maybe you'll understand where I am coming from. I probably don't make any sense to you, but not all students might want to do it. From my opinion I do not think that you should make all students work on their community service. I agree with the students that help others, and tutor elementary students and also pick up litter. But I think I'm going to agree more with the other half of the students. Because to me it kind of does take a lot of time away from the things we do or the things we want to do. For one example: say like if you have a whole lot of homework to do and its due tomorrow. But you also have the community service. What are you going to do the community service that your principal requires for you to do or the homework that's mandatory? See not all the time were going to have our time to do the things we need to do. I say that what if you give us a vote in on it. And we'll give you (the principal) the results for what all of us students think is better for us. Because i know that even when we do the things we want to do or the things we need to do we can also help others at the same time like tutor the kids that need help in what were working on. Some students might want to agree with you and some might not want to. So yeah! That's my suggestion on what you should and shouldn't do. Please take the time to read over this letter and think about it. Thank you very much!

I think that your idea for people who have at least a B average to be in activities is really not the greatest idea you could do for us. I will give three reasons for being against this idea.

I don't have a B average and am in band and I love it but if you take it away from me and my other band friends we will really be upset. I think that people should be in activities even if they don't have at least a B average. Everyone loves doing activities even if their grades are down, it makes school even more fun then it already is. If you take it away from us kids, we wont like school anymore.

People would go to school and look forward to the fun activities that are in place for them. I even know some people who are failing classes and do sports. I think you should do at least a C average or even a

D average for some students but don't ruin our school lives. When parents hear about this their children will be depressed and beg them to tell you to put activities back at school. Parents will help their child put their grade up but what happens if the student is struggling? Depression will hit them if that child does sports and doesn't get to play if they fail one single class.

Everyone doesn't like going to a boring school with no after school activities just because of their C average and all their other friends get all the fun. If you passed this I would get kicked out of band because of this. Don't so this to us students. Some of us are the best acting students and could be your best yet. You wouldn't be here without us.

Do you need help when it comes too challenging¬†sitituions and problems? Things aren't that easy in the world when sititutions you just don't know what to do, seeking or asking for someone advice is very help in a way. For example picking an new outfit for school you like two choices but don't know which one to pick because the two outfits are both cute so you ask one of your family members or ask a friends for their opinions¬†on which outfit is the best looking.

There are problems in life where you just don't know what direction to go in. Asking a good amount of people for their advice or their options are good so you can see an other person point of view or perspective of what they seem is good or bad for the sitituions. Like looking for a car isn't that easy there are so many brands,colors and other feature on a car you might like and it might be more than one you like but just don't know what to choice.

Advice can be and good, helpful thing or bad, hurting thing some people are gonna give you good advice that can help you in¬†a way and some people are gonna give you horrible advice that can hurt you in a way, say you are dealing with a sitituion with your boyfriend or girlfriend some people advice is gonna be that y'all should talk and work the problems out well on the other hand someone is gonna tell you that you don't need him or her or that person should apologize first when you were wrong and you might listen.

I think students should get to choose if they do work sports or put effort into clubs. They shouldn't be forced around by rules to do things. I disagree on mandatory extracurricular activities.

Extracurricular actives are extra time added to the already long school day. Students work for a total of 6 hours and 40 minutes a day and¬†the addition of the homework and projects with averages up to about 8 to 9 hours and day, we focus on school work. We don't need more time added to our already long and stressful day. Some students have a lot¬†of other things going on in their personal lives outside of school. So forcing student to stay after to do dance, sports, clubs, art is a waste of time, materials, and money. Paying for the equipment to do sports, paying the teachers and janitors for staying after school hours, materials needed for the clubs. Making kids do extracurricular activities creates a ripple effect, affecting the the whole school, it being money or on people.

Another reason is that the school doesn't¬†provide to the students in what they are interested in. So being forced into an club or group that you are not fond of, it will¬†only discourage them and unmotivated¬†the student not to try there best. If a student doesn't find the actives interesting and entertaining they wont care and they should get to decided if they get to put work and effort into a curtain activity. But having 1000 plus kids in about a few activities will make the some of the activities more crowed and more packed. And the teacher to kids ratio won't work out, 1 teacher with 50 kids. That sounds like a not of work for the teacher. But imagine¬†the buses and the parents in the cars that came to pick the kids up. The bus is gonna be stuffed with kids and the kiss and ride line is gonna be extremely long. And picture the traffic in front¬†of Generic_School, all of the cars and all of the buses trying to get to their locations.

In the end I believe extracurricular actives shouldn't be forced but more encourage. Schools should know that students are busy, that students are not interested in the same things, and to be aware of the ripple effect caused by making extracurricular activities mandatory.

25718,"When having the chance of asking various amounts of people for advice instead of one person. People should take more than one persons advice to make the best choices in their everyday lives. This can help people in many ways by seeing other peoples perspectives on their choices,or problems they are having making that choice. If someone only ask one person for advice this can impact¬†peoples decisions in a positive way,but also negative way. Seeking multiple opinions for advice can help someone make better choices,because getting someone elses point of view can help you make better decisions,and they can identify who has the best advice for their choices in life.

When people ask for advice,people usually ask more than of person,because some of their choices that they want advice on may be risky to make and others may be less of a risk to make. For example this spring break I am going to El Salvador but, I am going to miss about one week of school for,I have to ask my teachers for advice so I don't get behind on my school work or miss any test. This is to say asking multiple people for advice can be beneficial in peoples lives, so that they make the best choices to progress in their lives. Instead of just asking one person which may lead to making their worse choice. which is why asking multiple people for advice is always the best way to go.

Further more, when you ask multiple people for advice instead of just one person. You have a better perspective on what choices you should make,and which ones not to, but if you only pick one person to give you advice it can also be a disaster. For example,last summer my sister and I had a choice either we go to bush gardens or the beach with my aunt. I asked only my mom which one we should go to the beach or bush gardens she told us to chose which ever one we like best so we went to the beach, but since my aunt planed it last minute it turned into a disaster. Also if people only ask one person it may lead them to make the wrong choices like I did, because they are only getting one persons point of view on their choices that they are about to make,but you can always learn form your mistakes and avoid it next time. Thus this is why people should always ask for more than one persons advice to make their best decisions.

To conclude,when having multiple peoples advice people should pick which ever advice is the best,or combine all their point of views on that choice if they have ever experienced that same problem to make the best choice. You should always ask more than one person that you trust for advice because it makes your life more simple. Asking one person for advice can be great if they know how to give you advice,but it can also lead to down fall which is why most people choose to talk to more than one person for advice. So that they can come up with the best choice to make. People may have a difficult time¬†on what advice they should take and which advice they should not take. I believe that people should go with the advice that sounds best to them and not to think about their choices constantly.¬† ¬† ¬†",0,Seeking multiple opinions,persuade_corpus,False
22741,"I do not belive students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Society is constantly changing with technology, which is why its understanable for the masses to go the more efficent route, but being efficent does not outwiegh the numerous cons posed if one decides to choose online scholing. Attending classes from home can lead to health problems, lack of social interaction as well as not gaining the most in dept schooling due to the lack of personal interaction.

Online schooling can be linked to many health problems. Public schooling allows a student to keep a set scheduale of their day to day activites. It allows for a student to have a daily routine, with online schooling this routine is harmed. Most likely the student will lounge at home until an assigment is to be completed, there is nothing pushing the child to get up from their bed. Health risk become abdunt in this atmosphere. Diabites and heart failure are most present in todays society, the efficency allows for no hard work or strive. One becomes increesingly lazy as everything around them requires little effort. Humans genetic makeup forces them to look for the easiest possible route not the most beneficial route. Health problems are gonna constantly surrond a person if they make little effort to leave their house, you house is filled with indulgences ranging from youre bed to the food in you fridge, one must distance themselves from that. Online schooling requires much discipline, something most of society lacks.

Attending classes online limits the amount of social interaction one has with its enviorment. In school learning allows a student to interact with its classmates and fellow peers. Learning within an enviorment surrondeed by friends and classmates allows for one to learn about social cues and interactions, If one is stripped from this privledge they will lack the nesscary steps that will help them gain a better future. Social interaction is what builds a person, extroverted or introverted one needs to interact with its own species. Online schooling prevents this from happening, many introverted people will never be able to gain nesscary social skills if they are not pushed, In school learning allows for that push to occur. Attending online classes limits ones exposure to society. It allows for one to surrond themesleves in their own bubble, a bubble that they are not willing to leave. One has to face adversities within their enviorment to thrive later on, in school learning allows for that.

Online classes allow for a lack of personal interaction between students and teachers. One can not explain their thoughts via email or facetime, students need that face to face interaction to express their thoughts and concerns. Attending classes online leads to zero feedback from the teacher and the student. Schooling is extreamly surface level with this type of learning. An assigment is assigned and completed, their is no disscusion or questions, when one is in an in school enviorment he/she is pushed to ask about the assigmnet. Mearley posting ""any question or conerns please email me"" does not motivate a student to learn but insted motivates a student to get a good grade. As stated previously online schooling is extreamly shallow, its not about the learning its about the grades one will recive. This type of method of learning leads to failure in the encoding process, one does not properly retain the information but instead has a slight idea of it. Attending classes online leads to a lack of in dept schooling.

In conclusion, i do not belive students would benefit from attending classes online. Online schooling devlops bad habbits in ones psychology and creates a false narritive that the easist solution is the best solution. Attending classes from home will eventually lead to one gaining numerous health problems both mentally, physically and socialiy. Online schooling is an example of societies attempt to confrom the mases towards a technology drivien enviroment.

Electoral College shouldn't even be used anymore because it is widely regarded as an anachronism. In the Electoral College it's the electors who elect the president not the people.

If the electors are electing the president they want then why even let the people vote only for them to be disappointed. Also when voting for a presidential candidate you're actually voting for a slate of electors. There are many reasons for retaining the Electoral College other then there lack of democratic pedigree.

A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote wouldn't be the first since it has already happened in 2000. The reason is the the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his share of the popular vote. In 2012 election, Obama recieved 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3 percent of the popular vote cast for him and Romney. Cause almost all states award electoral votes and a state creates a landslide electoral-vote victory in that state. A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible because the total number of votes-538- is an even number but this is highly unlikely.

Overall you will decide what is best for this state but just take in mind my idea how the Electoral doesn't benefit the people nor you.

3154,"Summer break is the most anticipated time of year for students and teachers because it is a grace period that allows for relaxation and refreshment,of one's soul. The summer sees,the mental maturation of many students without the hindrance of a classroom,holding them back. The learning experience offered in a classroom setting is limited only to what the teacher and state permits. Students are not fully able to express their learning passions because they are forced to learn what the teacher permits. Whereas, during the summer students are free to conduct their own personal investigations on topics that peak their interest, resulting in a much maturer student by the time fall rolls around. To coincide with the theme of change and growth summer promotes, students should have the ability to choose their own projects, to further their educational experience and mental development, without the influence of a teacher.

The ability for students to choose their own summer projects would enhance their outlook on education,because they would study topics that interest them,and not teacher selected topics that would seem like a task. It is a scientifically proven fact that students retain knowledge that speaks to their own curiosities¬†and that holds the most relevance to them. During the summer, many students travel to new places or try new things. For example, last summer I was blessed with the opportunity to travel to Japan with my friends and family. While I was there I tried new cuisines,participated in festivities and I was able to learn about their history. My time in Japan, sparked an interest that I never knew I had in Japanese Geisha. I spent hours upon hours researching everything I could on them. But, my research was limited because I had to complete an AP Human Geography summer assignment administered by my future teacher. My assignment was to write a paper and create a brochure about a country. I thought it would be a perfect opportunity to write all about my trip to Japan. That is until I realized the teacher had already selected countries based on our last names. I was stuck with Great Britain, a country I already had a lot of knowledge of from history class and videos. I like many students completed the assignment without gaining any new information because doing the project felt as if it were a chore. Though,I do still remember the information I learned from conducting my own research into Geisha. Many teachers would argue that a student designed summer project would lack information or seem to rushed. Which would not be the case at all. Many students would take their time in crafting a project that meets all standards and would probably write more than what is expected, due to the project peaking their interest. Teachers would in fact, see an increase of higher marks. However, if a teacher feels that the project is not up to standards they could always low score it and have the student try again. In allowing students to design their own project teachers will receive projects that exceed all requirements due to the students behind the projects being interested in what they were learning.

If students were able to create their own summer projects, the result would be a more creative,responsible and independent thinking person. Teacher designed projects allow no room for creativity nor responsibility because there are guidelines and an examples set in place by the teacher,students have to follow. Thus, resulting in one hundred or more projects that all sound the same and lack any indication of the student's voice. Teachers would argue that summer projects must be designed by them, so that all students are able to receive full credit. Which is great in theory,but not in the long run. It does not benefit the student to have a guideline or rubric, it only benefits the teacher because the projects would be easier to grade. In the future, once students start working, supervisors will not give them examples of how to properly execute a project. For example, my mother is a graphic designer who is required to come with new ideas for campaigns, brochures and websites. Her boss isn't giving her instructions on how to complete the tasks, at all. She must be responsible in using her mind to come up with creative new ideas that she thinks would satisfy¬†her boss. However, at her old job all the graphic designers were given an example they had to follow. Which resulted in the closing of her old company because they only produced the same design. Luckily for mom, she was able to find another job fast because she was to create designs without assistance. The skills my mother used to think creatively and on her own, was taught in school. But, with teachers designing projects, students get used to a formula they have to follow and are not taking responsibility for their own thinking. Students creating their own summer projects would force students to take time and think of a project that they think would satisfy their teacher. It would stimulate new thoughts and force them to activate the create side of their brain that has not been used for a while,due to teachers constantly creating a rubric and examples for the student. The summer is a perfect opportunity for a student designed project because they would have time to develop their thoughts. Teachers shouldn't design summer projects because it aides in diminishing a student's ability to creatively solve projects.

Students should have the ability to create their own summer assignments because it would promote mental and educational growth that would otherwise be hindered in a classroom setting. Summer break allows students to embark on new experiences that can further expand their knowledge on topics that interest them. It would also allow more time for students to develop their ideas for the project. Which would strengthen their creativity and responsibility skills.

Sometimes people ask for multiple people advice. Sometimes asking multiple people is better than asking one person how to do it. For example you have a essay on the 1960's, you have called your relatives¬†that lived during that time period to help me with ideas and after me and my relatives discussed we changed our topic too something better. Well discussing with multiple about there ideas and opinions¬†makes people change it to something even better.

Asking experienced people who has been there done that rather than someone who inexperienced. Someone who is experienced is someone who has been at that point and has accomplished it.

Asking advice too some one who is inexperienced¬†and doesnt know as much is like this time when I was playing basketball tournament, I asked my dad for advice on how to score on this team his advice didnt work, then asked my coach who played the same position as me in high school and his scheme worked perfectly.

Most of the time asking someone who is more expireneced tells you what a better decision there is.

Finally by asking for multiple people opinions you feel prepared and ready. When you are asking for multiple people advice it feels like you are ready and when just asking one person you feel iffy about it and you dont want to do it. One time I did a public speaking at my school, it felt like I was going to fail this but lucky enough that my friends have already done it and gave me advice at being up at the podium and I did fine. Sometimes by just asking your friends for advice can make you feel prepared and ready to go.

In conclusion asking for advice from someone who is experienced¬†rather than someone who doesnt know as much as them in a certain topic, asking advice from more people gives you ideas or more opinions, and asking more people about there topic makes them feel prepared.

At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel,¬†father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different¬†chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice¬†to help you.

In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions¬†are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios.¬†",0,Seeking multiple opinions,persuade_corpus,False

The creation of smartphones and other communication devices has greatly shaped the human world of innovation; just as the creation of automobiles shaped the transportation community. However, when those two creations cross, disaster is expected. Thousands of car crashes occur a year in the United States alone due to distracted driving due to phones and other communication devices. Driving with phones increases the risk of distraction on the road and endanger surrounding drivers.

Distractions are inevitable when on the road. However, if it can be prevented, it should. There has been about 400 fatalities alone in Georgia due to distracted drivers. Car accidents are extremely preventable when the source of the accident is phone usage.

Of course there are a set of laws in place to find a way to still talk to a person on the phone with hands-free devices but the driver's focus is still limited. The hands-free merchandise and laws are primarily meant for GPS'; in which the usage of phones while driving is permitted. However, that is the only reason a person should be using their electronic devices while operating an automobile. Any other circumstance endangers the distracted driver and the people around him or her.

In this day and age of technology and innovation, a text message or phone call can wait when the lives of thousands are on the line. It is hard enough driving from one place to another worried about getting into an accident, the stakes are higher when drivers are distracted with their cellular devices. It is time to eliminate the usage of phones while driving in order to save thousands of lives.          ",0,Phones and driving,persuade_corpus,False
21609,"For me the best Policy is the first one because they will have it off during classes. Besides there is nothing wrong with calling or texting your friends. I mean what if there is an emergency and you have to use your cell phone to tell you friends that emergency. For example if you and your friends had the some classes but you have it before your friends and there is a pop quiz, you are able to tell your friends during you are walking to you next class.

Sure there might have their cell phones out during class time, then and only then the teacher may take up the cell phones and give it after class. But it will not be far to the students if a teacher takes up their cell phones on the students free time or lunch period, otherwise the teachers will be the one that will be breaking the rules or the policy. If the cell phone is the cause of their tardy then the teacher can take up the cell phone.

That is some that should happened if cell phones are allowed, and that is why the cell phones should be allowed",0,Cell phones at school,persuade_corpus,False
21203,"I think we should be able to have cell phones on during class (Policy 1) . It's free time. It won't change our education. We could text our friends and ask them if we have any homework in the next class. If we forgot to do some of our homework, we can ask them if we check it today so we don't get detention. You wouldn't be able to ask your friends the answers to a test or the homework or anything like that.

If there would be a family emergency, we wouldn't be able to know about it. If we had our phone on, they could call us and we would know about it. We then wouldn't be left out. If a family member was about to pass away, we could talk to them for the last time instead of rushing to the hospital before it's to late.

If there was a gunman in the school, we could just reach in our pocket and tell the police where were at instead of having the phone in our locker and risking our life to get it.

Having the phone with you and on could save your life one day.

It could come to a simple thing such as missing the bus in the winter. Then you couldn't call your Mom to come and pick you up. You would need to walk home in the freezing cold. If you live far away from school, you would need to walk all the way home and risk being hit by a car if you have to cross a highway. Then you got your parents worried where you are and if your ok.

If we forgot our school project at home, we could call our parents to bring it to school so we don't fail the grade and miss the Honor Roll. Then we wouldn't have a failing grade for ourselves and if we have a partner. Your phone could help you both pass.

23176,"Schools are offering distant learning for students to attend classes off campus. Many students are saying this is great and they are taking the offer to continue and better their education. On the other hand, some say that this is not the best idea for schooling. Schools want to give students an opportunity to better their learning and stay connected with education. Online classes would help tons of students move closer to graduation and a better future.

Most of the people failing classes or didn't graduate the first time around have things they have to do outside of school to help support their families. A big example of this is working. They have to work to make money for their families but without all of the education they need, they can't work for a better paying job. Therefore, lots of people are working multiple jobs to support families; this is leaving them no time to spend six to eight hours of the day in a building. Another example is that nowadays many teens are having to stay home to watch their own child or watching a family member because of finances in their home. Although being home may help out with home situations, students grades are dropping due to the amount of absent days in classes. Online classes and video conferencing would benefit these students by allowing them to take classes at night and/or multitask during the day.

Another case where distant learning may come in use is for students very involved in sports. Doing a sport can be a big responsibility. Sports are very time consuming, although some athletes make it look easy, there is a lot that goes into playing. Many levels of sports may require leaving the state or country for days, sometimes even weeks. While playing a sport it is easy to be injured or become sick. Furthermore, students are loosing class time and unable to make up for missed days in little time. Distant learning would be beneficial for those who travel so they can take their school work along and manage their free time. Online classes also help when they are sick or injured to give them time to rest and heal and still not miss out on continuing to learning.

In conclusion, yes distant learning as an option to students is very beneficial. Allowing students to attend class from home or while traveling could get more and more people willing to go further in learning.",0,Distance learning,persuade_corpus,False
25475,"Asking people for advice is a great way to make a easier problem solving.

When you go ask a person for advice your slowly taking weight of your shoulders. Even if dont think you are. Taking weight of your shoulder's is just a metaphor we use in the English vocabulary (your not actually taking a weights off your shoulder).

Not only are you taking weight of your shoulder but you're also reliving stress. You also stop getting worried about the problem.

Another important thing about asking people for advice is ask those you trust.

What i mean by

""ask the people you trust

''. Is because if you ask a class mate they could give you really bad advice. Or worse they can expose your secrete¬†to the whole class. That's why you should always ask a person you trust the most and someone you can relay on. Also make sure you can ask a pretty serious person you don't want to ask your class clown.

Asking people for advice when your having a problem is a easy way to try and solve that problem. Here's the thing your problem could be solved in a way much easier way if you ask a person for advice. Not only will it help you and your problem but your mental health as well. What i mean by mental help is your anxiety could go down a lot¬†not only your anxiety but your stress. It is a very important thing to do when you believe¬†you can't solve the problem. To ask a person or adult you trust and that you think could keep a secrete for advice.

Asking people for advice is a very easy way to solve a problem. But here's the thing not all advice's are smart or problem solving. This also follows to the trusting category from earlier. Trust is the main thing when asking a person for a advice. You trust the person you asked for advice not to tell any other person. Or not to give you a really immature advice. My advice is to ask an adult your really can trust or you can relay on. Chances are that they will give you a good fair amount of advice. You dont have to ask a adult if you don't feel well around that adult/person.

This is why asking for advice could help you solve your problem in a smart, and safe way. And make sure to ask those you really trust.   ¬†",0,Seeking multiple opinions,persuade_corpus,False
20625,"With the years, we have changing many things in our society. Since technology, by making new electronic devices, to things in our government, by making new laws and new things to help people in all the country. But, does that mean that we have to change the Electoral College to election by popular vote for the presindet of the United States? In my point of view, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution. And there are many evidence to support that keeping the Electoral College is beneficial to our country.

According to the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner, A dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College is possible, and it happened in 2000, but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote. For example, in 2012, Obama received 61.7% of the electoral vote compared to only 51.3% of Romney. Almost all states award electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis, even a very slight plurality in a state creates a landsalide electoral vote vistory in that satate. This demostrates, how people accept the fact that they are voting the electors and then for the President and Vice president. This help people by making easily the hour of vote for a candidate.

However, as we can se in the texts above, not everybody things like this. For example, in the text ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong"" by Bradford Plumer, the author says that according to a Gallup poll in 2000, taken shortly after Al Gore won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now. But, each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party's nominee, it is entirely possible that the winner of the electoral vote will not win the national popular vote. Yet that has happened very rarely. (Posner, paragraph #16).

Another evidence from the text ""In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised mothod of choosing the President"" by Richard A. Posner,¬† is when he says ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have trans-regional appeal"" (Posner, paragraph #19). That means that No region has enough electoral votes to elect a president. So a solid regional favorite has no incentive to campaign heavely in those states, for he gains no electoral votes by increasing huis plurality in states that he knows he will win. ""The residents of the other regions are likely to feel disenfranchised..."" That highlights how the Electoral College is trying to helping people vote their candidates and feel safe and comfortables with them.

To conclude, despite the fact many people say that the Electoral College is widely regarded as an anachronism and a non-democratic method of selecting¬† a president, the Electoral College is a traditional way to vote the President by the Congress and by qualified citizens that our founding fathers established in our Constitution that helps our community to help people with thir desicions and make our life more comfortable and easy.
