    ## Our Approach

    ### Data Collection and Preprocessing:
    - **Data Gathering**: Collecting a balanced dataset comprising both AI-generated and human-written content.
    - **Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by removing noise, normalizing text, and tokenizing sentences to prepare it for model training.

    ### Model Development:
    - **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical features that machine learning models can process.
    - **Model Selection**: Experimenting with various algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machines, and neural networks, to identify the most effective model for detecting AI-generated content.

    ### Training and Evaluation:
    - **Training**: Feeding the preprocessed data into the selected models and adjusting parameters to optimize performance.
    - **Evaluation**: Assessing model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using the testing dataset to ensure reliability.

    ### Deployment:
    - **Integration with Streamlit**: Developing an interactive web application that allows users to input text and receive real-time analysis on whether the content is AI-generated.
    - **User Interface Design**: Creating a user-friendly interface that displays results clearly and provides insights into the detection process.
