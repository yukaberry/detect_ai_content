# Core Libraries: 
## Text and NLP

	1.	NLTK (nltk):
	•	Purpose: The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is used for various text-processing tasks, including tokenization, removing stop words, and sentence splitting.
	•	Example Use: When tokenizing text to calculate word counts, NLTK’s word_tokenize and sent_tokenize functions help break down the text.
 
	2.	Stopwords (nltk.corpus.stopwords):
	•	Purpose: Stopwords are common words (like “the,” “and,” etc.) that are often filtered out in text analysis. We use NLTK’s corpus to easily access lists of stopwords.
	•	Example Use: To calculate lexical diversity, stopwords are removed before further analysis.
 
	3.	TextBlob (TextBlob):
	•	Purpose: TextBlob is a simpler NLP library that offers sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and noun phrase extraction.
	•	Example Use: Used to extract sentiment polarity and subjectivity, helping classify text as positive, neutral, or negative.
 
	4.	SpaCy (spacy):
	•	Purpose: SpaCy is a powerful NLP library known for its speed and efficiency in text processing tasks, including part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.
 	•	Purpose: TextStat calculates readability scores, such as the Flesch Reading Ease and SMOG index, to determine how difficult or easy a text is to read.
	•	Example Use: Calculating the readability of each text segment to assess its complexity level, which may be a distinguishing feature.
 
  5. TextStat (textstat):
	•	Purpose: TextStat calculates readability scores, such as the Flesch Reading Ease and SMOG index, to determine how difficult or easy a text is to read.
	•	Example Use: Calculating the readability of each text segment to assess its complexity level, which may be a distinguishing feature.

	6.	Transformers (transformers.pipeline):
	•	Purpose: Transformers by Hugging Face is used for pre-trained language models. The pipeline function provides easy access to tasks like summarization, translation, and more.
	•	Example Use: We could use the summarization pipeline to generate condensed versions of text, aiding in text comparison.

## Word Embeddings and Semantic Analysis

	7.	Sentence Transformers (SentenceTransformer, util):
	•	Purpose: Provides pre-trained models that can generate sentence embeddings, which are vector representations capturing the semantic meaning of text.
	•	Example Use: Embeddings are generated for each text segment, allowing for similarity comparisons and clustering of similar texts.

## Topic Modeling Libraries

	8.	Scikit-Learn (LatentDirichletAllocation, CountVectorizer):
	•	Purpose: Scikit-Learn offers various machine learning algorithms, including the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and CountVectorizer for word counts.
	•	Example Use: LDA is used to find underlying topics in the text, and CountVectorizer helps by converting text data into a bag-of-words format for topic modeling.
