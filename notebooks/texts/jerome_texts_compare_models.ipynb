In contrast, a rigid code of standards and adherence to traditional ideas of beauty can alienate us and limit our potential.\\n\\nIt is essential to take responsibility for our individual identities and never lose sight of our own values. Being ourselves in a society that is constantly trying to push us to fit into certain standards and expectations is no easy feat. On the other hand, refusing to conform to certain societal norms can lead to isolation and judgment.\\n\\nRegardless of the potential risks, embracing one’s true self can be one of the strongest steps we take towards building meaningful relationships and renegotiating our own identity. This challenge can come with both rewards and consequences. Through the promotion of self-acceptance we can achieve unity, not uniformity. In this way, instead of being programmed as replicas of pre-determined standards, we can be individuals that are both unique and united in our personhood.. On one hand, standing up for our beliefs and embracing our true selves can lead to a greater sense of self-fulfillment and satisfaction. \\nIn a world of constant comparison and criticism, it can be difficult to stay true to yourself']\n",

      "[\"Doesn't the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. Even machines don't work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.. Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Don't they need any break. If you can't have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you don't get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ?\\n\\nHigh school isn't just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. We hope to do so much but can't accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school.\\n\\nIn the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Human beings don't need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day.\\n\\nMore ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face.\\n\\nMemories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. It will always hunt you in your dreams. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell 'no' sometimes. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesn't serve a purpose. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools.\\n\\nBeing a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins\", \"Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit.\\n\\nIn many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits.\\n\\nIn conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. . In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.\\n\\nSecondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just won't show up that whole school day. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes.\\n\\nLastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center\", 'Like for example If my school have adopted a four day school week with each day two hours. Reason i think it should is beacuse we can have a 3 day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep,if studnts have after school jobs they can have good hours. So yes i feel like our school should follow up with for day school week extending the school day two hours others students would not like it that way but teachers and studnets to but from my opinon yes i think our school should follow up with that .. It would help alot and be more easier for others and myself. Have Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3 day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help alot because i can go school do my two hours on Monday,Tuesday,Wedesnday, and Thursday and i feel like we could help out teachers alot not only studnets could help out staffs teachers and studnets . Adopted a four-day work week with each conisting of ten hours should my school follow up with this modle.\\n\\nFrom my opion yes', 'In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author talks about Earth\\'s sister planet and the chaotic environment it hosts. They also mention that for years, scientists have Been trying to discover ways that this planet may Ce hospitable or of good use to humans. The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the risks and dangers Because evidence shows that it has features much like Earth, and could sometimes Ce the nearest option for a planetary visit.\\n\\nGeographical features show that at one time, Venus was likely covered with oceans and could have supported life. The author states, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (4). This shows that while conditions on Venus may Ce particularly Brutal, there is a high chance it was once a habitable land like Earth.\\n\\nThough there are certainly high risks that come with traveling to such a dangerous planet, there are ways for humans to survive them. The author mentions that, \"Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions CY staying up and out of their way. ... the air pressure would Ce close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would Ce plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels\" (5). Bith humans\\' current technological advances, it is made possible to avoid the worst of the cruel conditions on Venus, like sweltering heat and impossible atmospheric pressure.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is a lot to look at for Both sides of this topic. The author does a good JOC with addressing the issues that come with sending spacecrafts and people to Venus, while also talking through the ways some complications might Ce avoided. ', 'Therefore, it is important to understand the symptoms and the support needed to help navigate the day-to-day realities of living with mental health issues. It is important to stay informed, patient and have the courage to seek help when needed.. This can include engaging in activities you enjoy or reaching out to your support network. It is important to be patient and actively listen as listening to the person you are caring for is one of the most important elements of care. Caring for someone with mental illness can be emotionally and physically demanding; it is essential to practice self-care. \\n\\nCaring for someone with mental health issues is an incredibly rewarding yet challenging journey. Additionally, have a good understanding of available resources and treatment options, such as therapy, medication, self-help techniques, and other forms of support. \\nCaring for someone with mental health issues can be a huge challenge. As a carer, you should be aware that mental health can fluctuate from good to bad days, and you may have to adjust your approach accordingly. \\n\\nIt is also important to take care of yourself. Finally, it is important to be aware of any signs of burnout and reach out to professional help and support if necessary', \"we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain.\\n\\nEvery country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and that's why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and won't fail no more next school season.\\n\\nFamily over school, family is the most important thing, i'm don't know anyone that dont like his families members, so let's said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then let's agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level.\\n\\ni'm sure that they have families and have to rest. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you don't need in a real life, that's why it's not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life.\\n\\nFirst of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and don't want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. for example; let's take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so that's kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you don't have any interest in or you don't like at all, it's not good. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends.\\n\\nSecond think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, that's all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didn't get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break.\\n\\nso some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that.\\n\\nThird thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. what, that's insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation\", '\\nRequiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an important decision that can have a significant impact on the students and the school community. On the one hand, requiring community service can give students an opportunity to learn valuable skills, while also more generally instilling in them a sense of responsibility to their community. On the other hand, extra punishment, such as suspension, can have a strong deterrent effect, sending a message to the rest of the student body that actions have consequences. \\n\\nHaving experienced the effectiveness of both approaches while in school, I believe that, for serious violations, suspension is the more appropriate approach. First, it sends a more serious message that violations will not be tolerated, able to shift the culture of a school in a short amount of time. The experience of suspension itself can also help remind students to take their academics and behaviors more seriously, and the lack of attendance may help students target their studies with greater focus. Ultimately, I think that a combination of both approaches is best; mandatory community service and supplements of harsher punishments when warranted provide a system of checks and balances that can be used to effectively deter students from breaking school regulations.', \"\\nImagination can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving success. It enables us to go beyond our known boundaries and explore possibilities that we had not considered before. It gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new, explore uncharted territory, and extend the boundaries of what is possible. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.\\n\\nTake the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.\\n\\nIn summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success. Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. Without imagination, knowledge alone cannot be leveraged effectively to manifest the desired dreams and ambitions.. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.\\n\\nOn the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively\", 'This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you\\n\\nSome benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. Like for example let\\'s say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. Let\\'s say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.\\n\\nThere still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.\\n\\nConcluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.\\n\\nBy taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says \"distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing\". Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. Another thing is the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.\\n\\nThe benefits that you get does not end there.           ', 'I disagree that this Facial Action Coding system is beneficial for the classroom. There are many things about this that could go wrong. This type of secondly would not be valuable to our schools.\\n\\nAlthough all the facial recognition sounds good, there are some parts to it that could be bad. There are many things that could turn out to be negative. Here is a question to think about: Is he downgrading teachers? In the sixth paragraph Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science predicts, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\", he continues with, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" I believe he is trying to say that teachers don\\'t do enough, so we have to bring in a computer instructor to make it less boring. This is not only bad for the students, but also the teachers.\\n\\nThis also can be a distraction in class. While the teacher is giving a lecture about an important skill that students need to learn, there are students in the back of the classroom trying to mess around with the facial coding system by trying different faces and causing a disruption. Kids are easily distracted and this is just another distraction from keeping kids engaged and focused on the studies that they will need for the rest of their life.\\n\\nWhile a child is learning, for instance, a math program site, they could be trying to get in it, but there are ads that pop up, in paragraph 6 it states that \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow. But if you frown, the next ad will be different.\" If a child looks away from the computer at his/her friend to wait for the ad to be over that he/she doesn\\'t want, and smiles while glancing down to the screen to see if the ad is over, the computer could take this as a happy signal for the ad. to then it will play another one that is similar to the ad that the child did not want.\\n\\nQo, no, I do not believe that this technology would be a very good tool to express in the classroom. I believe that there are lots of things that could go wrong, and not enough right. I don\\'t think that this Coding system would be valuable to our schools.', 'More schools , classes are making it easier to access assignments that can be completed online ,\\n\\nyou can view what assignments you have to complete in class by using your cellphone instead of being overwhelmed with paperwork , your tasks can be completed online.\\n\\nI believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms , it will make learning in class easier due to the easy access of the internet , in case of family emergencys and for any other reason you might need it.

I believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms because , If someone needs to call you , family emergency , and it could also be used as learning tool.\\n\\nAlthough sometimes cell phones in school might be used for personal reasons like soical media the pros of being able to use your cell phones in school outweigh the cons. It is much easier to call someone during school on there celluar device instead of having to call the school wait for the school to find the classroom the student is in and then transfer the call to the student in that classroom. In todays current society millions of people use electronic devices at work and school , Schools should implement more use out of technology and let kids use their phones in class to help complete tasks assigned to them ,\\n\\nfor example , If a kid does not want to use a dictionary and to find a word he can easily just look up the words meaning on he internet using his phone.\\n\\nIf someone needs to call you during school they can easily do it by just dialing up your number instead of having to call the school.

While attending school CN person has cts benefits, there are also many advantages to being homeschooled. In this essay, I well explore the benefits and drawbacks of students being able to attend school from home, including how ct affects attendance, responsibility, and job preparation.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of attending school from home cs that ct allows students to have more flexibility CN their schedules. This cs particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities. For example, cf a student cs a talented athlete, they may be able to attend school from home and still have ample time to practice and compete CN their sport. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have family obligations, such as caring for younger siblings.\\n\\nAnother benefit of attending school from home cs that ct can foster a greater sense of responsibility CN students. When students are responsible for their own education, they must take a more active role CN their learning. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, selfdcsccplcne, and problem-solving. Additionally, when students are homeschooled, they often have more OneNote time with their teachers, which can help them develop a stronger relationship with their educator and receive more personalized attention.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some drawbacks to attending school from home. One of the main concerns cs that students may not have the same level of social interaction as they would CN a traditional classroom setting. This can be particularly problematic for students who are new to a school or community, as they may struggle to make friends and form meaningful relationships with their peers. Additionally, some students may mass the structure and routine of a traditional school setting, which can make ct difficult for them to stay on track with their studies.\\n\\nAnother potential drawback of attending school from home cs that ct may not provide the same level of job preparation as a traditional school setting. While home schooling can be tailored to a student's individual needs and interests, ct may not provide the same level of exposure to a diverse range of subjects and extracurricular activities that a traditional school setting offers. This can make ct more difficult for students to be competitive CN the job market and may limit their career opportunities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while attending\", \"By taking advantage of the knowledge and experience that authorities can provide, people can find the answers they seek and make educated decisions based on the best possible information.\\n\\nThe support and guidance that experts can provide can also help prevent undesirable outcomes, such as incorrect decision-making that may lead to a financial loss, legal trouble, or other undesirable repercussions. \\nThe question of seeking advice from experts and authorities in life's important matters is one that can be both difficult and beneficial.

This student's experience therefore differed from other similar programs where there was a more even mix of the different age groups.\\n\\nGiven the challenge that programs with both older and youngest students can face, there are a few strategies that can help to address this. It is important to consider the impact of this intergenerational mix on both younger and older students.\\n\\nFor example, an essay described a student's experience in such a program in which the older students often contributed to the lack of learning for the younger students. \\nIt can be difficult for students of different ages to learn from each other in the same educational environment due to their differences in knowledge levels and diverse experiences. Additionally, designing lesson plans to ensure that all students are engaged and learning together can also be beneficial.\\n\\nOverall, programs with both older and youngest students can present some challenges due to the differences in knowledge and experience between the two age groups. However, by implementing strategies to address the issue such as tailoring curriculum and engaging in lesson plans, this can help to achieve a successful learning experience for all students.. For instance, creating curriculum specifically tailored for different ages can be beneficial. The older students may have more experience and knowledge than their younger peers and as a result, they could overwhelm the younger students\", 'At the same time, too low of a requirement can be counterproductive, as students may end up focusing more on extracurriculars than academics. \\n\\nWeighing these pros and cons, it seems that the school should strive to keep its current GPA policy not too high or too low. Some districts set low GPA requirements in order to open extracurriculars to larger numbers of students. There are benefits to each approach. Doing so allows the school to maximize the benefit of extracurriculars while still encouraging students to remain academically successful. However, setting such high requirements can limit the number of students who are able to participate and deny them the opportunity to benefit from extracurriculars. \\nAfter researching how other school districts handle the Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for extracurriculars, it is clear that district policies vary significantly. \\n\\nLower GPA requirements open extracurriculars to more students, enabling them to benefit from the positive activities and social interactions these activities provide. \\n\\nHigher GPA requirements provide an incentive to remain academically focused, while ensuring only students that are doing well in school are participating in extracurriculars.

And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. If they need it because they can loose their job.\\n\\nLets say if the students decide to design the project there own. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.. Students and teachers have important roles in their life. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.\\n\\nAt the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.\\n\\nHaving the teacher design the project is way smarter. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job', \"Venus ID the closes' planet to Earth in terms of density and size, and occasionally the closest in distance too. Earth, Venus, and Mars, our other times to Venus. Because Venus is sometimes right around the corner in space terms humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on this cloud draped world.\\n\\nA thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times grater than what we experience on our own planet.\\n\\nThe planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Furthermore, recall that Venus can sometimes be our nearest option for a planetary visit, a crucial consideration given the long time frames OS space travel.\\n\\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study Venus.\\n\\nMore importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. Therefore, scientists seeking to conduct a thorough mission to understand Venus would need to get up close and personal despite the risk. Or maybe we should think of them as challenges.\\n\\nNASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus, For example, some simplified electronics the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions. These devices were first envisioned in the 1800s and played an important role in the 1940s during world war ll. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more dedicated when it phone or tablet to acid or heat capable of melting tin.\\n\\nStriving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself. Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\", \"The debate of whether modern technology, such as the Internet, well ever replace the book or the written word as the main source of information has been a topic of discussion for many years. While modern technology has increased the reach of information, I do not believe that st well ever fully replace the book or the written word.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, books have been around for centuries, and with their physical form, have largely been the main source of information. This has allowed us to store vast amounts of knowledge and easily access st. Furthermore, books are more reliable as they are written and published by reputable authors and organizations. This allows us to trust the information they contain, which SS not necessarily the case with the Internet. The Internet SS often filled with unreliable sources and fake news, which can make finding accurate information difficult.\\n\\nAdditionally, books remain the best source of information for research. As most books are written by experts SN their respective fields, they often contain depth information that SS difficult to find online. For example, sf one SS looking to wrote a paper, they well likely find more reliable source material SN a book than they would online.\\n\\nIn addition, books provide a greater level of concentration. In today's world, with so many distractions, st can be difficult to stay focused on any one thing for a long period of time. With books, however, one can simply open the book and began to read without any worry of being distracted. This allows readers to immerse themselves SN the content and subsequently learn more from the material than they would sf they were using the computer.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while modern technology has increased the reach of information, I do not believe that st well ever fully replace the book or the written word. Books provide a reliable source of information, are better for research purposes, and provide a greater level of concentration. Therefore, I do not agree that modern technology well ever fully replace the book or the written word as the main source of information.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nIn conclusion, the growth of technology has made a huge impact on our lives. With more online services and options available for customers than ever before, technology is here to stay.. \\nThe growth of technology has had a tremendous impact on people's lives in the 21st century. \\n\\nThe development of online jobs, such as being a YouTuber or investing in stocks, have changed the way people work and made professional success much more accessible. This impact is perhaps felt most strongly in the rise of online technology, which has allowed people to acquire knowledge and skills, search for jobs, and do their shopping more conveniently. It allows us to access quality education, search for jobs, and do their shopping more conveniently.  \\n\\nOne of the advantages of online education is that it's now easier and more cost effective than ever for people to access quality education. Despite the potential profits, there are associated risks as well. \\n\\nLastly, online shopping has completely revolutionized the way people buy and receive goods. Popular companies such as Amazon have made it incredibly convenient for customers to order and receive the items they need, and the convenience factor and competitive prices make it an attractive alternative for people all over the world. For example, a case study of my brother's online courses has demonstrated the effectiveness of digital learning for better career opportunities\", \"We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day that's mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school.\\n\\nWe would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more.\\n\\nWe might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things.          . I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school.\\n\\nSome people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didn't get the grade for the project. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now.\\n\\nFinally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that we're using right now. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment\", '\\nWith the implementation of a four-day school week, the conservation of energy and resources could be significantly enhanced. The extra two hours added to the school day could be used to provide additional instruction and educational activities, which might lead to a more efficient use of resources and energy. Ultimately, the potential benefits of a four-day school week must be weighed carefully against the consequences for students with part-time jobs.. While the additional day off could give a student more time to pursue an after-school job, it could also result in fewer hours and less pay due to the extended school day. Furthermore, costs associated with transportation, such as gas and tolls, and food could be reduced as schools would only be open for four days each week.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of a four-day school week, particularly for students with part-time jobs', 'While working alone is beneficial in some cases, it is often more beneficial to have a group of people who are dedicated and motivated to work together towards a common goal. Working in a group also leads to a sense of community and collaboration, which can help build rapport between members. Discussions and brainstorming can help bring new and innovative ideas to the table and help everyone learn from each other. For starters, when trying to tackle a complex problem or project, there is often more brain power within a group than an individual. This helps create a supportive and encouraging environment, which can inspire individuals to continue working hard and reach their goals. \\nWhen considering the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that teamwork has certain advantages. From increased productivity and effort, to learning from each other and creating a sense of community, working in a group can help people to make progress on challenging projects, learn new skills, and work together towards a common goal.. Working in a group enables different individuals to come together and share their unique insights and perspectives, helping complete the task quickly and efficiently. \\n\\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there are many benefits of working in a group versus working alone. Working in a group also allows people to divide the workload, so each individual is responsible for a certain component or task. This can help ensure that no one person is overwhelmed with too much work and hold the team accountable for completing their tasks in a timely manner.\\n\\nFurthermore, working with others provides an opportunity for people to learn from each other', 'If you\\'re not doing something to help you get better, you\\'er failing, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life, and inactivity does not serve a purpose to this quote. Doing something makes you accomplish more. Be the one who changes your life by doing what it takes to do something in life to reach your highest goals.\\n\\nLet this quote be a inspiration of achieving and succeeding in life or at anything. You may fail a couple of times on this and that but what are you doing to not fail again? If something isn\\'t right and want to fix it, do something about it.\\n\\nIn the other hand, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life. Thomas Jefferson once wrote \"determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" I strongly agree with this quote for many reasons. Inactivity is getting in the way of you not achieving and succeeding. Only you can change yourself whether you want to be successful or not.. It takes effort and hard work to do something but at the end, it all pays off. Be the one that can make a change. I take inactivity as a negative act because I dont want to be sitting at home or anywhere not doing something to help me get better. Although, others may think different and disagree with this quote, other people in this world needs this motivation.\\n\\nIf you\\'re not doing something to help you get better, you\\'re failing. This role plays a huge part of others because failing is not a choice. I play baseball for 10 years now and my goal is to make it to the big leagues but with this being my goal, I have to do something to help me achieve my goal. Success is not giving to you, you have to earn that success and by that, do something to help you succeed your dream.\\n\\nAt the end, inactivity does not serve a role in this act', 'Finally, by helping to nurture and promote the talent of others, it serves to benefit the current and future generations.. \\nThe benefits of participating in drama, music, art, or any other class can be far-reaching. This not only provides a sense of harmony and wellbeing in the community, but also serves to develop and maintain a cycle of positive energy that goes beyond the current generation of students.\\n\\nTo conclude, participating in drama, music, art, or any other class can be both highly rewarding and beneficial for students. By understanding and appreciating the creative side of life, students are in a position to nurture, support, and promote the talents of others. These skills and understanding can help students in a variety of ways, including better understanding their role in society and helping improve their job prospects.\\n\\nIn addition, the experiences and knowledge that students gain from these classes can benefit future generations. Such classes provide students with invaluable experiences that not only enrich their academic pursuits, but also open the doors to a range of potential career opportunities. Participating in such classes can provide students with an enhanced understanding of the world around them, as well as the tools to better explore and appreciate it.\\n\\nThe knowledge and skills gained from these classes can provide students with an LEDE (Leadership, Ethics, Development, and Engagement) that can help them work toward and achieve their individual and collective goals. Such classes are not only a way to enhance academic pursuits, but to also open the door to a range of potential opportunities and to allow students to gain an LEDE which can help them in the future. Such classes also offer students a chance to explore their creative sides and develop talents that may otherwise be left untapped', '\\n\\nRather than aiming low and potentially missing out on success, it is better to aim higher and work hard to make one’s dreams come true. With hard work, dedication and the will to strive for success, great things can be achieved, no matter the odds. Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. \\n    One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success', \"In school there are a lot of fun and educational activities. If there wasn't any fun science experiments; I wouldn't like to go to science.\\n\\nSome kids say that science is the worst subject in school and it is boring. my most favorite experiment is when we are mixing chemicals because you don't have a major clue of what is going to happen when you mix them up, and that is what makes it interesting and fun at the sma time. There are more experiments that you do in science like making a volcano eruption or something else but science can be fun if you pay attention to what the teacher is saying and following the rules because there can be fun but there has to be rules or somebody can get hurt\\n\\nIn conclusion there might be some better educational activities but in my opinion i like more science experiments, however, it does get boring sometimes and you just don't want to do anything, therefor, you just can't complain about life, you just got to with it and enjoy it .. In science there are a lot of awesome experiments and tools you can use, and they are fun to use. One of my favorite activity to do in school is a science experiment. In my opinion scinece has a lot of cool stuff that you can't do in any other fun activity in school\", 'Similarly, our sense of self and how we interact with the world is greatly impacted by the standards and expectations of the society we are raised in. It is generally accepted that both biological and environmental influences play a role in the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. \\n\\nThough definitive answers remain elusive, it is important to recognize that both our genetic makeup and our environment contribute to our character. Our individual traits have been deeply affected by the experiences and behaviours we have been exposed to, while also relying on the biological foundations we have been given. Biological influences, such as our genetic makeup, play an important role in how we have been hardwired. Understanding the complexities of this relationship can help us to better understand ourselves, and how our character is formed.. On the other hand, environmental influences, such as our upbringing, the people around us, and our experiences, often shape the way we think and behave. \\n\\nUltimately, it is likely that a combination of both nature and nurture are what contributes to our character. \\nThe debate between nature versus nurture in determining our character traits is one that has long been discussed, and it is difficult to come to a right or wrong conclusion. While we are born with certain traits based on our genetics, these traits can be shaped and molded by the people and experiences in our lives. Our Outlook on life and the actions we choose to take are shaped by forces outside our control, including our environment and the people around us', \"Gun control is a big issues in lots of countries. Peoples got diff'rent opinions on it. Me, I think we need stricter gun control laws. Because, like, there's too many shootings and stuff.\\n\\nFirst reason is that guns r dangerous.

He didn meant to, but he was playing around, and it went off. Xow he's in a wheelchair. It's just sad.\\n\\nSecond reason is that there's too much violence. In America, there's like a mass shooting every week. It's crazy. Peoples got guns, and they think they can do whatever they want. They shoot up schools, churches, concerts. Its like, why can't we just have a nice life? Why we have to be scared of getting shot?\\n\\nThird reason is that guns r easy to get. Anybody can get one. You don't need a license or anything. Just go to a store and buy one. That's not right. There should be stricter laws. Make it harder for peoples to get guns.\\n\\nFourth reason is that guns r not just for hunting. Peoples say they need guns for hunting. But that ain't true. They want guns for protection. But you don't need a gun to protect yourself. There's other ways. Like, you can learn self defense. Or just call the cops.\\n\\nFifth reason is that stricter gun control laws work. In countries where they have stricter laws, there are less shootings. Like, in Australia, they have strict laws and hardly no shootings. Its just common sense.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, we need stricter gun control laws. Guns r dangerous, there's too much violence, guns r easy to get, they are not just for hunting, and stricter laws work. We have to do sum thin bout this. We can't just sit around and let peoples get killed. It's time for change.\", 'Students without distractions can gain more knowledge. Also, students can learn new vocabulary.

Students learning developed by focusing more in class and avoiding any distraction, so students can have better grades. Students challenged them self.\\n\\nIn conclusion, students learn many things by working alone. Students can work as slow and fast, as they want. Students can have more support and ideas from others in groups; however, students works better alone than in groups. Sometimes when students are working in groups they get distracted by other team member and that cause a negative impact in the students learning. Students can ask the teacher if they need support', 'While praise from others can be encouraging and uplifting, it is more fleeting and does not necessarily fuel an inner motivation to work harder or strive for your goals. Similarly, if a person pursues a goal to become healthier and meets that goal, they can be filled with an inner sense of pride, self-satisfaction, and enhanced self-worth. For instance, if an individual sets a goal to finish a book and perseveres to the end of the project, they can feel a sense of accomplishment from having completed the task. However, self-esteem from achieving goals leaves a lasting impression that can be accessed even when no outside praise is available.. \\n\\nThese feelings of increased self-esteem from goal achievement are different from the sense of self-worth that comes from praise. Achieving goals can give us a sense of accomplishment, a powerful boost to our confidence, and a feeling of increased pride in ourselves. \\nBuilding self-esteem by accomplishing goals can have powerful and long-lasting effects', 'Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone.

This means being understanding and respectful of others, regardless of first impressions. At the beginning of the year, the student saw the teacher as unapproachable and strict\", \"Have you ever heard the term majority rules? It means if more than half rule on one side, then that side will win. Many organizations and committees use majority rules because it means they are taking advice from multiple people and not just one. Taking opinions from multiple people may help someone with making a better choice. I believe it could give options to the wisdom seeker, it could make them confident about one choice that they could go with, and it would mean they would have multiple arguments for a side.\\n\\nWhen someone takes an opinion from multiple people, they have more choices/pieces of wisdom. If a person is writing an article and needs advice on what to write, they go to one person and only get one piece of advice to help them with their article. If they go to multiple people, they have options to weigh and decide what they want to write on. One example of this is Congress. Before any bill passes, they all take a vote. Whichever side is more than half will win, which is majority rules coming back into play. Congress does this to see what others have to say about the topic, not just what one person has to say. This is one of the reasons why taking more than one opinion can help someone make wise choices.\\n\\nLast summer, I played on a travel basketball team that went to Maryland every weekend and played in a tournament. I was the point guard on the team, which meant that I was the captain on the court. I was calling plays, running pep talks, and keeping my teams head up. One Saturday, my dad and I drove up to the tournament and when I got there, all my teammates were excited. They started telling me about how easy our schedule was and how we could easily win this tournament. Our first game came and on the first play of the game, I twist my ankle. I sat the rest of the game out and my 2nd game as well. I told my dad that I would be fine to play in the championship, but he told me that I couldn't. Furthermore, I asked my coach, and he told me that I should not\\xa0take the risk. Furthermore, I was mad that my coach and my dad said I shouldn't play, but we're still ending up winning. The moral of the story was that I took my dad's and my coach's advice and decided not to play. Since I got the advice from 2 trusted adults that I knew, I understood that it was probably the smartest decision for me to make. Taking advice from multiple people can make someone more confident about their choice on the topic.\\n\\nGetting multiple opinions on a topic such as a debate article may not always mean he/she is right, but it means that they have multiple people's arguments on the topic. Bor's example, if I asked around about child soldiers and I had multiple people tell me that they shouldn't be given amnesty, I could use their arguments to my side even if they should be given amnesty. If someone takes advice from different people, and they all tell you along the same lines of the same piece of advice, they could use it even if it's wrong, because they have people standing behind them with the same argument and same reasons.\\n\\nTaking advice from multiple people is more helpful than taking it from 1 person because it helps give options to someone who might need it for a test or a scenario in their life. It is also helpful when someone knows the advice they need, but they want to check with others to see if they're thinking the same way about the scenario. The last reason of why it is important is that even if someone takes advice from many others and the advice is wrong, he/she has their arguments to help you out. This information is very important at the moment because right now the world is tasked with something they could use a lot of advice on. The Coronavirus is a disease that has 115,000 cases all around the world and the U.S. has 574 cases. The world has not found a cure yet, and I believe that scientists are trying to find the cure themselves, so they can get all the credit. If all the scientists in the world worked together and used each other's advice and equipment, we could find a cure very easily and quickly. This is an example of using multiple people's advice because there could be 2 scientists who are very close to finding the cure and if they work together they could easily find the cure.  \", \"Mae Jemison, the first African-American woman in space.

Jemison used her knowledge to shape her journey into space\", 'The effects of students gets involved of a program, is relate ship,teamwork, and truth willy because all this thing builds up like a friend ship. The older students show and help the younger students.\\n\\nLastly truth willy is very important, because it is part of people life. This will help the students trust each other will and as a friend or family. It can make them real lies relate ship is important to people.\\n\\nTeam work is other thing that is important to the program,because it share friend ship ,and relate ship. The students will trust each other as a team work or a friends.\\n\\nInconlotion relate ship, team work, and truth willy make up a friend ship, and the program that the students will be as a team or a family. Team work can assist there team in game or in praction. The program help both the students by assist each other. It will effects a lot of people as a team. . Friends can lead up to best friends. Truth willy will make program better and truth willy to other people. Also the students will experiment this well there in a program as a team.\\n\\nRelate ships is a important work with someone else. Relate ship can also help other people, what they did wrong to people. The program also help a lot to the students. The both students will get more friends and look each other. Also the program can make these students become friends', \"Additionally, some students may not have the time to attend the club's regular meetings due to other school or extracurricular commitments. However, there are a few potential issues that students may have in joining the club. \\nJoining a homework help club at school can be a great way for students to access assistance with their studies. It can be particularly useful for students who don't have access to tutoring and may be struggling with a specific subject. Firstly, the student may be hesitant or uncomfortable about asking for help, as this could be seen as an admission of weakness or inability. Through the club, students can get access to help from knowledgeable tutors who can help them to understand complicated concepts. Furthermore, members of the club can collaborate and discuss difficult topics, leading to better understanding and better performances in school. \\n\\nOn the other hand, there are many potential benefits of a homework help club. Joining a homework help club can also improve student's motivation and interest in studying as well as helping them to build relationships with their peers.\", '\"Phones and driving\"\\n\\nToday\\'s generation, phones are becoming an issue on the roads and putting people\\'s lives at rise.\\n\\nPhones should not be allowed to be touched or played on as you are on the roads so that you are fully aware of what\\'s going on in your surroundings and also not taming your eyes off the roads. Texting while driving may ruin yours or another person\\'s life.\\n\\nThere are a lot of rises that could happen and put your life or someone else\\'s lives in danger. Most people pick up the phone because they say it\\'s important, but even then the phone would be a distraction. Tame a moment to sit and thing about how many accidents occur because of a text, now thing about in old times when texting while driving was not a problem at all.\\n\\nAuthorities put down strict detailed laws about having your phone in your hand while driving. Each offense doubles every time you get caught, but this law was hardly effective because no one is taming the safer advice to insure the safety of yourself and others on the roads. The fines would turn into something more serious and if you got into a wreck, injuring another person you could more than likely spent some jail time.\\n\\nI Now phones shouldn\\'t be allowed to be messed with while you are driving because imagine if it were you in the situation and getting into a wreck all because someone was paying attention to their phone and not the road. You could lose it all in a blind of an eye, or you could made someone else loses everything, don\\'t be that person because either one there are causes and effects to your actions even if you didn\\'t get hurt, you probably hurt someone else that has family that loves them lime crazy.\\n\\nhttps://www.

For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. Thus, conserving energy and resources following the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully way for emergency school situations.\\n\\nConversely, some people may claim that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not conserve energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources with this two more hours. It could be helpful for community needs and emergency situations in the school area. However, following this model, by extending the school two hours would conserve energy and resources for school area and community. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. It can be a form to give necessary resources for whom need it in the community. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Conserve energy and resources through this model could be a helpfully way for the school. Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community.\\n\\nSecond, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs. Therefore, adopting the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully method to support the school area and the community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, to conserve energy and resources, some businesses adopted a four day work week,each day consisting of ten hours. This conserve energy and resources could be a way to support the school and the community. In other hands, some people may argue that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not be a conserve form for energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources. Thus, following this model, by extending the school day two hours will be a helpfully way to support emergencies situations in the school area and support community needs.. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. Conserving Energy and Resources\\n\\nTo conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. It can be a support form for the community area. However, it can be true, but to retake my point, following this model by extending the school day two hours would conserve energy and resources. For example, at Generic_City occurred a strong earthquake at the beginning of this year. The school could follows this model by extending the school day two hours because it can be a helpfully way to support the school area in emergency situations. In other words, by extending the school day two hours and conserve energy and resources ,they were supported with this conserved energy and resources in this emergency situation. Generic_School was one of the school which adopted and follows the model to conserve energy and resources, as a result they were supported in their necessities in this disaster', \"They may lack the polish and be behind in certain skills needed for the next journey. \\nGraduating early can be a very beneficial way to further a student's education or career, but there are some potential risks that should be considered. Early graduates may not be as prepared as their peers for the next step in their career or education. It may enable them to start their career earlier, or even give them the opportunity to pursue further education or specialized courses.\\n\\nThe drawbacks, however, can be significant. They would also miss out on the networking, connections, and experiences that would help them further their education or career.\\n\\nIn conclusion, graduating early can be a great way to benefit a student's education and career prospects. However, potential risks and drawbacks must be weighed against the potential advantages to make an informed decision.. On the positive side, graduating early can allow a student to jump ahead in their college or job career\", \"An average person would just buy the project to use but they care less how the system works. It also shows that they where interested in there product even way before they where interested in the job. The Microsoft Industry most likely want people to know how to use there programs and software's because they are most likely going to make the employee's use the programs.\\n\\nSome people may disagree with me that you don't have to be experienced with Microsoft software's and products because they think in order to get the job they will have to spend money to purchase Microsoft products and there monthly programs. For example I use there gaming console, laptop, tablet, and there desktop. Most people only know the basic tools in word and that proves that they are not interested in the software then just to do a quick essay. Iv'e study how they first made the gaming console and I also study how they made the Microsoft tablet/laptop. Iv'e taken classes to learn about these tools and more about Microsoft programs. I will say they are wrong because in reality most jobs would prefer people who are experienced with there product and software because then they dont have to teach a lot of stuff to the new employee. I use Microsoft software on a daily base because I use there software to work on something or to study them on how the software works. Better and skilled people equals faster progress and thats what company's want.\\n\\nI should be elected into Microsoft Engineering because I endure the company and enjoy everything that they have to offer. Most jobs I will say want people who are experienced in there products because it shows that you enjoy there company and it shows that you will do great things for the company. Iv'e been buying Microsoft products through out my whole life and that shows that I love there products and it shows how supporting I am to Microsoft company.                . It taught me a lot of stuff then an average person. I have studied most tools and all Microsoft software's. I don't just use Microsoft products I also study the products and how the system works. I have experience with Microsoft products and I know how there system works. I also fixed broken Microsoft products therefore the only reason I knew how to fix it because I learned about the products and Iv'e studied them.\\n\\nMy second reason why I should be elected in Microsoft Engineering is that I am very experienced with Microsoft software and programs. People use word too type an essay or something really important. I am skilled with most of there software and most of Microsoft products. I am also experienced with Microsoft Software that they have created.\\n\\nI should be elected to work with Microsoft because Iv'e been using Microsoft products through out my life. I will do great things for the company and make the company better then ever. In the other hand I care how the products works because its interesting. I am experienced with most Microsoft products that they have made through out my whole life. Most people use Microsoft software, For example Microsoft Word. Most people know how to use Microsoft Word because its built to be simple, but in my case I know more tools and know more stuff about the program. Iv'e studied most of the tools that Microsoft has to offer in there software and trust me there is a lot of more stuff you can do with Microsoft word then just type a simple essay. Hi, my name is Generic_Name and I am interested in pursuing in Microsoft Engineering. They also may disagree about me having to know more tools and skills about Microsoft software's is a better way to get the job\", 'Ralph Waldo Emerson is the author. So, she didn\\'t give up to be a scientist. After he got a driver\\'s license, he can drive anywhere. But Generic_Name thought, \"If I am not gonna take the driving lesson anymore, I can\\'t go far anywhere.\" So, he didn\\'t give up and took the driving lesson. But, there are many hard science problems, and experiment materials. For example, Generic_Name wanted to give up for the driving lesson. Because he didn\\'t give up to write a statement. So, she is studying a science. She realized, \"If I give up, I can\\'t do something later.\" So, she is doing hard for her job, scientist.\\n\\nWhen you give up, it will be hard to succeed, and get the benefit.. She studied hard, and researched how to succeed in the experiment. But, she decided to don\\'t give up for her job. He wrote, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\" I agree with his statement. He drives very well after he took the driving lesson.\\n\\nAnother example, Generic_Name wants to be a scientist. After she did that, she got a job scientist. Also, she is doing lab with the experiment materials in the laboratory. After that, he got a driver\\'s license. So, she wants to give up, and get another job that can do easy way', \"Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends.\\n\\nSickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online?\\n\\nIt is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Because there we all know may some of students have chidern, or students are disaplelty person ,example disapolty persons can not go bythemsevs to school in the issue the online classes can make for thses students a big different so they can take time off if they are not feel well,and take their pale in the time. The great benefit of online classes for mother or father that may be they are students is the time. So there will calm in the mind of the students because they will know that wouldn't be missing classes. Which if they have kids or teenagers the online claeese can be benefitationl bacuse they can speent time with their kids and teen to see if they are doign good in school.\\n\\nAnd the end the technology make the lifes easly and helpful;safe time,make anything be done on the time, so we can say technology refund the time for these who always busy.. Or if students are moter or father, it will be easy for them to kake care of their childern and take classes online . Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from honme by way of online video conferncing. So that's why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Hwoevery; they will feel busy in their time but at lest there is options which is online classes. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere.\\n\\nFamilies responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. And that will help students that don't want to school because of these kind of issue the online class will be btetter for them. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax.\\n\\nBecause after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse\"]\n",
