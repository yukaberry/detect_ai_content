Conversely, a person who chooses to stick to a socially accepted career path, for the purpose of stability, may be said to have a more pragmatic but less adventurous character. For instance, overcoming adversity or tragedy can lead to a person's resilience and empathy, two qualities which can profoundly shape a person's character. A person who chooses to forego higher education and instead pursue their passions despite it being considered unconventional by society and family, in turn demonstrates their strength of character, courage and conviction. Similarly, a person exposed to wealth and affluence may exhibit qualities of privilege, enabling them to view the world in a completely different way. \\n\\nOn the other hand, external experiences can have just as much influence over a person's character. Experiences ranging from loss, hardship, failure, tragedies, or rewards such as successes, successes, accolades, and other forms of achievement, can all leave an indelible impression and shape a person's character and outlook. While our decisions give us a certain degree of control over our life's path, events and experiences will ultimately shape us, and our reactions to them, into who we are.. Can it be measured? Is it based on a person's choices, or are we all pre-destined by life's influences? Irrespective of the answer, one cannot deny the role that both “choice” and external “experiences” have in shaping a person's character\", 'On the one hand, a curfew can foster a feeling of safety and security for teens. \\nThe debate continues over whether or not to impose a curfew on teenagers between the ages of 16 to 18. This can lead to teenagers feeling unwelcome in their own homes, resulting in depression and even delinquency.\\n\\nTherefore, when it comes to implementing a curfew on teenagers between the ages of 16 to 18, it is important to consider the benefits and drawbacks of the midnight weekend curfew and the 10 p.m. On the other hand, it can impose unfair restrictions, hindering them from succeeding academically, emotionally, and economically.. On one side, the curfew may be seen as beneficial due to the structure and protection it provides to them during the weekend. weekday curfew. A midnight curfew on the weekends provides teens with the opportunity do positive activities, such as homework and getting extra sleep, while avoiding the potential dangers associated with being out late at night. It also forces teens to prioritize their extracurriculars and other activities, allowing them to focus on their education.\\n\\nOn the other hand, imposing a weekday curfew of 10pm may be seen as too restrictive for teenagers, who need to take part in activities that will be beneficial for their futures. Without the opportunity to attend extracurriculars and engage in after-school activities — such as internships and volunteer work — certain teens may face a disadvantage when it comes to the college admissions game and even job applications. Further, a strict curfew can make teens feel isolated, as if belonging to a family or community is denied', \"Does they will be study good? And, does they will need this program? They need time to finish their homework. Hobby, learning, traveling, study in school. . Each school study more that one hundred students. Many students in high school took not much hard subjects, most of them are art and music . Educational programs alredy have to take courses during the summer, if student don't finish important subjects. Each our doing, need time and study too.\\n\\nWhat about thoose who need extra time? What about imigrants, which needs extra time to their homework. Making rool that student finish faster high school, must takes courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses, is not a good idea.\\n\\nMost of our life need time. Most of them don't have time to study good with four years education program.\\n\\nAlso, what about teachers? Does this subject will be intresting to students to study? Does they will have time to explain students, what they study? Teacher need some time to be ready for topic that give school to student. Also need explane this on lesson and after lesson, if student don't undestand this on the lesson.\\n\\nNowbody, don't have extra time.\\n\\nOf course some of school can make three year of education, but only some of school. Educational program must be have extra time and be intresting to all students\", \"An average person would just buy the project to use but they care less how the system works. It also shows that they where interested in there product even way before they where interested in the job. The Microsoft Industry most likely want people to know how to use there programs and software's because they are most likely going to make the employee's use the programs.\\n\\nSome people may disagree with me that you don't have to be experienced with Microsoft software's and products because they think in order to get the job they will have to spend money to purchase Microsoft products and there monthly programs. For example I use there gaming console, laptop, tablet, and there desktop. Most people only know the basic tools in word and that proves that they are not interested in the software then just to do a quick essay. Iv'e study how they first made the gaming console and I also study how they made the Microsoft tablet/laptop. Iv'e taken classes to learn about these tools and more about Microsoft programs. I will say they are wrong because in reality most jobs would prefer people who are experienced with there product and software because then they dont have to teach a lot of stuff to the new employee. I use Microsoft software on a daily base because I use there software to work on something or to study them on how the software works. Better and skilled people equals faster progress and thats what company's want.\\n\\nI should be elected into Microsoft Engineering because I endure the company and enjoy everything that they have to offer. Most jobs I will say want people who are experienced in there products because it shows that you enjoy there company and it shows that you will do great things for the company. Iv'e been buying Microsoft products through out my whole life and that shows that I love there products and it shows how supporting I am to Microsoft company.                . It taught me a lot of stuff then an average person. I have studied most tools and all Microsoft software's. I don't just use Microsoft products I also study the products and how the system works. I have experience with Microsoft products and I know how there system works. I also fixed broken Microsoft products therefore the only reason I knew how to fix it because I learned about the products and Iv'e studied them.\\n\\nMy second reason why I should be elected in Microsoft Engineering is that I am very experienced with Microsoft software and programs. People use word too type an essay or something really important. I am skilled with most of there software and most of Microsoft products. I am also experienced with Microsoft Software that they have created.\\n\\nI should be elected to work with Microsoft because Iv'e been using Microsoft products through out my life. I will do great things for the company and make the company better then ever. In the other hand I care how the products works because its interesting. I am experienced with most Microsoft products that they have made through out my whole life. Most people use Microsoft software, For example Microsoft Word. Most people know how to use Microsoft Word because its built to be simple, but in my case I know more tools and know more stuff about the program. Iv'e studied most of the tools that Microsoft has to offer in there software and trust me there is a lot of more stuff you can do with Microsoft word then just type a simple essay. Hi, my name is Generic_Name and I am interested in pursuing in Microsoft Engineering.

Forty-five percent of people in the world enjoy doing outdoor activities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              . By doing that I can go to the zoo with friends or go to a park and play sports with them. Another activity that I enjoy is playing soccer with\\n\\nmy dad and brother we always go to the park and play with my cousin then after that we would go out to eat and its better than sitting home all day and doing nothing.\\n\\nThese activities can be enjoyable because you together with family and friends and that can make things fun. Something like going to community parks, state parks, and even national parks. In conclusion, there are many enjoyable things to do outdoors you just have to find the right activity that suites you or maybe even try new things do to by yourself or find someone to do it with. This story is what motivates me to go out side because I dont want the freedom of going outside to be taken away.\\n\\neveryone like a little bit of fun for example last week me and my friend went bowling and then we went to the mall it was pretty enjoyable because I forget about everything and focus on myself and the people I am with. Enjoyable ways to spend you time outdoors can be going to festivals hanging out with friend or even reading a book in the park.\\n\\nSome interesting and enjoyable outdoor activities that I like doing is going to the zoo, going on a picnic, hanging out with friends and family, playing some type of sport, or visiting a amusement park. There are many thing you can do you just have to find the right activity the you like and enjoy. People can use going to the park and reading a book as an escape of reality and life and going into their imagination. The other percentage of people are indoors sleeping, watching TV, or playing video games. For example my friend PROPER_NAME had skin cancer and he was so scared of being out side and he wanted to hangout with his friends, play sports, and go to the park and have picnic. There are many reason why these activities can be enjoyable. I personally can do both, there are other days when I just want to stay in the house and there are other days when I want to get out the house and do things like playing soccer with my brother and father. Just sitting home all day doing nothing can cause you to be lazy and hide away from the world but also going outside is good for you mental growth. My mother has always told my sibings and I that we should go outside more often and I think to myself why is it important for us to go outside if there are more problems in the world the being indoors.\\n\\nI think that being outdoors can help you open you mind up more to new things and experiences. I find it interesting the when we were younger we loved being outdoors playing with our friend and now that we are older and have electronics we decide to stay inside because its more entertaining', \"As an ecghthgrade student, I believe that students should have the option to attend school from home. While attending school CN person has cts benefits, there are also many advantages to being homeschooled. In this essay, I well explore the benefits and drawbacks of students being able to attend school from home, including how ct affects attendance, responsibility, and job preparation.\\n\\nOne of the main benefits of attending school from home cs that ct allows students to have more flexibility CN their schedules. This cs particularly beneficial for students who have other commitments, such as sports or extracurricular activities. For example, cf a student cs a talented athlete, they may be able to attend school from home and still have ample time to practice and compete CN their sport. This flexibility can also be beneficial for students who have family obligations, such as caring for younger siblings.\\n\\nAnother benefit of attending school from home cs that ct can foster a greater sense of responsibility CN students. When students are responsible for their own education, they must take a more active role CN their learning. This can help them develop important skills such as time management, selfdcsccplcne, and problem-solving. Additionally, when students are homeschooled, they often have more OneNote time with their teachers, which can help them develop a stronger relationship with their educator and receive more personalized attention.\\n\\nHowever, there are also some drawbacks to attending school from home. One of the main concerns cs that students may not have the same level of social interaction as they would CN a traditional classroom setting. This can be particularly problematic for students who are new to a school or community, as they may struggle to make friends and form meaningful relationships with their peers. Additionally, some students may mass the structure and routine of a traditional school setting, which can make ct difficult for them to stay on track with their studies.\\n\\nAnother potential drawback of attending school from home cs that ct may not provide the same level of job preparation as a traditional school setting. While home schooling can be tailored to a student's individual needs and interests, ct may not provide the same level of exposure to a diverse range of subjects and extracurricular activities that a traditional school setting offers. This can make ct more difficult for students to be competitive CN the job market and may limit their career opportunities.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while attending\", 'Finally, while there may be time-saving benefits associated with online classes, students may miss out on the sense of community and social activities that are more easily available by attending traditional classes. For busy students, having the freedom of self-paced learning can be a double-edged sword, since it requires a great degree of discipline and self-regulating in order to ensure coursework is being completed in a timely manner. Additionally, for students hoping to enter certain professions, attending traditional classes may be important for boosting one’s career prospects. \\nWith the rise of online education, many students are considering taking classes online instead of attending traditional classes. Ultimately, online classes may provide some freedom and flexibility to students, but it is also important to consider the tradeoffs that come with such otherwise convenient learning opportunities.. While there are a number of advantages to taking online classes (e.g., the ability to study at your own pace and the convenience of not having to physically attend classes), there are also downsides', 'IH 1976 NASA released a photo of a landform oh Mars resembling a human face. Not everyone was easily convinced that it was only just a landmass though. Conspiracy theorists believed that it was, \"Bohr FIDE evidence of life oh Mars.\" IH the article \"Unmasking the Face oh Mars,\" the author, Garcia, believed that it was only a mesa. I agree with Garcia that this landmass was Hot ah alien or proof of aliens whatsoever.\\n\\nThere is a large amount of proof IH the article that was confirmed by NASA that this face is only a landmass, Nothing more. IH paragraph two of the article the author claimed that mesas were ordinary IH Cynthia, area the mesa was located, according to scientists. The only difference between this mesa AHD other mesa\\'s found oh Mars is that it had uncommon shadows over it illustrating eyes AHD a mouth. Since mesas are common IH this area it is very unlikely that this, \"face,\" was anything different that just ah average mesa take Hat ah odd angle with a low quality camera.\\n\\nThe author also stated IH paragraph seven that IH 1998 that the photo was retake with a higher quality camera. NASA released the photo onto a JPL website once the photo was confirmed AHD the only thing found was Hot ah alien monument, but a Natural landform. Many people still doubted that it was a mesa after this photo due to wispy clouds blurring the picture of the monument. According to paragraph ten IH the article, the picture was take the last time of the landmass revealing the same thing, ah average mesa.\\n\\nMesa\\'s also are found commonly IH the American west as said IH paragraph eleven. The mesa resembles the Middle Butte IH the Shake River Plain IH Idaho. The two mesa\\'s share a similar height, appearance, AHD were Hot alien monuments. People argue that the mesa IH Ohio does\\'t have a face appearing oh the top, but the only reason the mesa oh Mars has a face is due to the angle at which the picture was take Has I said earlier IH my piece.\\n\\nThe two opposing sides IH this argument have evidence to argue their opinion. The belief that the mesa is actually a face is incorrect due to evidence IH the article AHD my essay. Mesas are common IH the area the picture was take AHD the face was caused by shadows along with a low quality camera. Whichever side you are oh I believe I have brought forth though evidence to change your opinion or strengthen your opinion that there was Ho alien lifeforms yet found oh Mars.', 'Something that i would like to accomplish is raising and taking care of my baby bearded dragon, until it is fully grown and ready to start breeding. This is really important to me because I always loved reptiles as a kid and i want prove to my parents that i am capable of taking care of a bearded dragon.. The climate of a bearded dragons natural habitat is very hot since they can be found every where in Australian deserts.\\n\\nI want my bearded dragon to grow up being friendly, and not so aggressive, so since bearded dragons are social animals they often need to be in contact with a person and keep being played with or can be taken out of its tank and let it roam around the room. Bearded dragons need to get bigger tanks as they grow old because they get bigger and more curious. Bearded dragons need these requirements so they can grow up to be healthy and strong, the calcium covered insects makes the bearded dragons bones strong, the UVB lights also help the bearded dragons bones. I have to feed my bearded dragon its required insects covered in reptile calcium, and bearded dragons need proper lighting', \"You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. That's why it's better to be active.\\n\\nTherefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. Like a personal trainer or a coach.\\n\\nInactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. In some people's life activity play's a major role in there life's. You do accomplish more if you stay active and you can meat your goals in life if you put hard work and not staying idle.. I can'not stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise.\\n\\nI like working out or helping people out especially my family. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. My thought on the prompt are that I think it's better to be active. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If I'am inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. You can'not be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and do'not intervene is better to stay idle.\\n\\nFinally,I some occasions is inactivity serves a purpose. Being active or doing something all the time is good. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit\", \"Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online.\\n\\nStudents also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.\\n\\nTherefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school.        . Maybe even discover what they are good and take that for their future. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you can't do it from home on a computer. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.\\n\\nIf they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.\\n\\nI understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers\", 'Like for example If my school have adopted a four day school week with each day two hours. Reason i think it should is beacuse we can have a 3 day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep,if studnts have after school jobs they can have good hours. So yes i feel like our school should follow up with for day school week extending the school day two hours others students would not like it that way but teachers and studnets to but from my opinon yes i think our school should follow up with that .. It would help alot and be more easier for others and myself. Have Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3 day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help alot because i can go school do my two hours on Monday,Tuesday,Wedesnday, and Thursday and i feel like we could help out teachers alot not only studnets could help out staffs teachers and studnets . Adopted a four-day work week with each conisting of ten hours should my school follow up with this modle.\\n\\nFrom my opion yes', \"but that is not possible to do that if he say that the people will be scared with that thing but if I agree with Emerson he can do something about opinion and the people they can do the other opinion and to understand, and how we can agree with other, we can agree something is very important Emerson he can need to stop how to agree or to take out if we do agree we can do each ether. he suppose to agree because there are people they agree and they grow the people have experiences.\\n\\nEmerson he suppose to agree and people will come to agree with him if is not that the people will not be able to agree with him and that is good to grow, agree is opinion of the people and correspondence the people they have experience to agree and he need to be experiences to other people. The person can agree and he can't do any opinion but he can understand the opinion that he agree. I agree with Ralph waldo Emerson because he say that if you try to do something you will never grow and that mean you can't do anything with Emerson. Emerson he has a opinion for something he agree and he can do whatever he know but that is not great if you have some ideas you need to took and we can agree each other with other people if we don't know it we can tell with other people they know how they can agree the think we have to agree and that will be good for other people they can say that was very good to agree.\\n\\nthen if that will be great to the people we suppose to it and that is good for the people or person If that he don't to agree the people they can do it many people they do something is important to them if they don;t do anything how they can agree If Emerson does do anything that mean he don't need the people to agree anything with him.\\n\\nEx.\\n\\nI can agree and people they can be able to do whatever they want to do and if they have anyithing we can help each other.. and we can grow we can stay down, he can keep it up not down if will be down how that will be not grow that need to grow is not to stay down.\\n\\nWe can agree about the opinion and to come to understand the agree with the original, the people agree but is not all of them some they agree, because that give the opinion to understand ideas but spicy food that does not agree with person or to the people with other does\", \"I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life.\\n\\nThere was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. In this world not everyone is born complete. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life. I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself.\\n\\nI strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. But that all changed later when i realized i needed to have others to help me. You are the protagonist of your own life, your life is your own.. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to.\\n\\nThe last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help.\\n\\nIn conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. Theres a lot of people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesnt want to help you at all\", 'When used appropriately, cell phones can be a helpful addition to the classroom environment.. The temptation to access social media or play games can pull students away from their studies, making it difficult to stay focused and on task. However, while many students report positive experiences with cellphones in the classroom, there are also drawbacks that should be considered.\\n\\nPros of Cell Phone Use in Education:\\n\\nCell phones can be incredibly useful tools for learning. Cell phones can also be used by students to organize their studies and help them stay on track.\\n\\nCons of Cell Phone Use in Education:\\n\\nCell phones can be distracting if not used responsibly. Finally, the temptation to cheat is greater, as students may be able to access answers online during a test that they may not otherwise have access to.\\n\\nIn conclusion, cell phones have the potential to be great tools for learning, but they can also be an arduous distraction. They can also disrupt the classroom environment if students are allowed to use their phones while other students are learning. With the power to access the internet, students can supplement the learning they are already doing in the classroom. They offer access to an array of educational tools that can be beneficial for students and help them stay organized and on top of their studies. As with any technology, it is up to the teacher, student and parents to create a policy that respects the needs of the student while ensuring focus and respect for other students present. Additionally, many educational apps are designed to make learning fun and interactive and are used to develop key skills such as critical thinking, as well as testing knowledge. \\nCell phones are becoming increasingly popular in classrooms as students look for ways to maximize their success', 'Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy.\\n\\nThird of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. Technology has come a far way from where it started. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and that\\'s a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face.\\n\\nSecondly, technology has it\\'s pros as it has it\\'s cons. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. Technology, 21st centuries finest product. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it.\\n\\nFinally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. nearly everyone loves technology, is it really that beautiful? When i was a kid people used to say \"technology will end our social life.\" I didnt believe that then, but now i see what they were trying to say.\\n\\nPrimarily technology\\'s goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese.                                                  . Human is a social creature by it\\'s nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think they\\'ll die. If someone tries to change a creature\\'s nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it... All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them', \"Say one student who doesn't like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class.\\n\\nIn conclusion that, if they choose it's required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. Imagine that you like photography but they required you to get music, art, and drama instead of photography they will be upset. So I think that those classes aren't required to take unless they want to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you won't pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. They will take it but they won't do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesn't like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective aren't mandatory to take. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesn't need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take.                                                                                                     . Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because it's their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes.\\n\\nIf you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they won't do any classes that are forced them to take. If they say it's required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if it's for whole year I will choose they aren't required.\\n\\nI think they aren't required to take those classes, because those classes aren't meant for them\", \"It good that they did bad choice because they real what they did and they won't do it again in their life. Some people don't want help for other people. Sometime good to listing to other people opinion if it will help you understand your problem or to make good decision or not. Everyone should make own choice or own decisions in their life. You don't have to wrong about other people opinion. They can make their decisions. It's great that teenager are make decision in their life. They could solve their problem at there own.\\n\\nFor example we don't need people to tell other people how to live their life. They should have good friends that make good decision in their that always help them in their life. The prompt talk about who people have own instincts and ideas or to make their own decisions. The only who makes decision are the adults or the teenager but not the kid's. Nobody have to tell them what to do in their life. Their life is so important to them that they could make own decisions without people tell what to do or ruin their life. They don't want other people to be wrong about their life or be noise. Sometime good to hang out with friends but you have to make good choice if you're going to hang out with your friend's.\\n\\nI know people can make own decision and can help other people to not make bad choice in life. Teenager sometime make bad choice when they are with their friends hang out. Sometime family don't agree with your choice or decision you want to make. If they want to help they should talk with the people if want help or not. Then you are on your own with you're problem. He or her can follow their own instincts or idea. I know everyone want to help out but sometime they don't want help for other people,friends or their family. Is good you got friends and family that have your back when you want to make own decisions in your own life. If you have a friend that make bad decision sometime at friends won't help you out. You're life is important you should make good choice in you're life to happy or live your life with you're family's and friends. People should be wrong about their life not other people life. People can live their life but they have to make good choice their life not bad choice. They learn the lesson to don't make bad choice in their life or to not hang out with their friends. People make decisions in their own life. . They a lot people that make bad decision or good decisions in their life\", 'You can have a attitude and you still can be good is not always bad.. So that\\'s why having a attitude not always means bad.

Having a good attitude in a difficult time is a great way to stay calm and talk to others with respect. I witnessed one day a new kid came to my school with attitude he was giving out everyone what they want like many people asked him where he was coming from he said \"I\\'m coming from\\n\\nNew York\". He had no problem talking with teachers and other kids cause he wasn\\'t feeling shy to talk with them he was happy and he was making an eye contact with everyone he\\'s talking with. The kid probably had fun he made new friends earlier than other kids that were new. So is your choice to be whatever you want how you wanna be treated because if you gonna treat others with bad attitude you should not expect them to treat you with respect', \"and the hours of school everyone can be more consetrated and don't felt sleep and learn the possible.. so must people prefer to work and make money than have more hours of school. so you can conserve the energy and don't be extreced about be more time in school. but must people what need is money. And prefer to work.\\n\\nThere are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family.\\n\\neveryone need time to have and be with the family because family is importan. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.\\n\\nIs hard to be in school and have a job after school. so they can conserve anergy and resources and have have enought time with the family. because both of them are important for our life. so for these reason my chool should not fallow this model.

First off I third it would rot be a good idea because it's sorry distract the teachers. All the teachers are sorry be worried about how the students feel. Some students do rot like talking about their problems at school. The teacher is already sorry know the students emotions before they sit down IR their desks. I would't wart my teacher growing all my emotions. Teachers are supposed to teach you but rot Orly just teach but be there if you reed to talk to them about something. I feel like its invading privacy of the student. I third we maybe should because it might actually help the teacher later more about their students. Some students do rot like going to talk to the teacher so maybe if the teacher talks to the student they might feel better ARD the teacher will also know about that as well. I third if we got it IR schools right row it would probably help.\", \"Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Changes in live are always good it is just will to do it. Usually, people don't try to do something new that they are already do. People should explore beyond they are used to do in order to get growing. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing.\\n\\nTo add, People will not be able to grow, if they don't change in order to grow. In many circumstances dare to do new things will gave people a benefit. People don't have to be mastered in one thing but many of them.. They know that explore new areas is best way to grow as professional. What is the best advise to get growing? Ralph Waldo's statement is one, which motivates to others to explore new areas, and people will not grow, if they do always the same.\\n\\nTo begin, in the society there are many jobs where is necessary to expand in new areas to get improvement like photographers that usually work shooting pictures, but they know how to shot a video also. In this competitive world people have to be a mastered in many things, but people are used to work in places that they are in comfort. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they can't play and be the best player either. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. Photographers can explore new areas like cinematography world or work as a journalist. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement has the reason, for people is not able to achieve their goal when they do constantly the same. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness\", 'I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don\\'t think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The reason I said it\\'s taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn\\'t want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn\\'t have been the best. As an example right now I don\\'t think I did good on this essay but i\\'m going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.\\n\\nIn conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.\\n\\nI used to be the type of person who wouldn\\'t really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn\\'t have my guard up. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there\\'s no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself\\n\\n\"what is the point of doing all this?\". I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn\\'t deserve to be treated good. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. My mom is the person who\\'s always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i\\'ve always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn\\'t want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don\\'t want to be the person who fails them.\\n\\nMost jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you\\'re doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.\\n\\nFinally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don\\'t know how to cope with it', \"Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit.\\n\\nIn many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits.\\n\\nIn conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. . In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course.\\n\\nSecondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just won't show up that whole school day. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes.\\n\\nLastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center\", \"She decides to take the opportunity with a good attitude. Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes.\\n\\nOn the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities. Experiences appears in people life so they can learn from them, but having a good attitude makes then more fun and interesting. But having a good attitude can help them to face their obstacle, it help them to never give up, like famous actors of movies, shows, and many more.    . Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience. It is important to have a good attitude because people can face their obstacles, it gives them many opportunities and experiences to learn.\\n\\nNobody is perfect in the world, everyone has obstacles to face forward. They past through many things to be came successful, but they face them with a good attitude and yep sometimes with bad attitudes. A good attitude is important because even when people have a difficult time they can face them. At that time Generic_Name was very upset, but an opportunity appear on her life. What are some benefits of having a good attitude, even in a difficult time? A good attitude can make people successful even in a difficult time. She never give up and she always was with a positive attitude, when Generic_Name was 30 years old, one of her son's died from Cancer. But not always people have a good attitudes, and sometimes affects them. A positive attitude helps people in their life because it gives them many opportunities, like\\n\\nGeneric_Name,\\n\\nthe mother of a girl, who had face many problems in her life. One of the experiences that learn is that when you give money or food to a homeless they shared it with other homeless with a positive attitude. To the contrary of people with good attitudes are awesome because they are intelligent and they have an incredible wisdom. A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time.\\n\\nOverall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude makes people strong, and to always have positive thoughts and emotions. People often have opportunities but they don't know how to confront them. Generic_Name always has a positive attitude even during in a difficult time.\\n\\nOtherwise, having a good attitude gives people many experiences. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. They think about others, even when they don't have to much. Before they came to be famous they face their obstacles to be someone in life. Having a good attitude helps people to be more intelligent and to face their problems\", \"In some cases if we don't finish on time they, will ask us to stay after school. And kids need to concentrate in their work instead of lacking off.\\n\\nAt Generic_School, phones and headphones are a huge problem. Dear Dr. Online classes can be much cheaper than to actually go to school. Also in school we all get distracted so easily, like from fights that happen in school, drama, and class clowns that are not really doing their work. I believe that some students should benefit from taking online classes because we won't have to worry about turning in papers late, or having to hearing teachers to put our phones and headphones away, and also I won't worry about owing school lunch money. Some of our parents work late nights and won't be able to get a ride back home. A lot of teachers find this disturbing and run to writing us up, but they won't understand how much faster your brain functions when listening to music, it gets you more concentrated into your own work.\\n\\nOur parents work and the school thinks that they make lots of money, due to that cause the school charges us for the food we eat. At home, we can eat breakfast and lunch and not think about that eating breakfast or too early or if eating lunch is too late.\\n\\nThank you once again for reading my thoughts, I strongly agree that our students should benefit from taking online classes while being at home.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nGeneric_Name. Classes at home can be such a big change in a good way, we won't get in trouble if we get found using our phones or even listening to music. When taking tests, or quizzes, we seemed to get rush because we only have that class for and hour and some change. Students work better at their pace than rather to wait on the teacher, teachers go slow just for the other students get to know what's going on. Some of us like to listen to music and work better with it, but however, some teachers don't always allow it in the classroom. Classes that we can take at home could benefit us here, we have better food at home and wont worry about if the food that we get at school is expired or not. Generic_Name,\\n\\nThank you for taking time out of your day to read my letter, hope you and your staff are doing well. My name is Generic_Name and I'm currently a Junior at Generic_School. Online classes is a should and it can also be a shouldn't, and i will explain why its a should.\\n\\nIn school we all panic when we hear a due date, especially when its up close.

', 'But if we set goals that are too easy, we may become complacent and never strive for improvement. \\n\\nOne famous quote by Michelangelo that relates to the challenge of setting goals in modern society is, \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\" This quote speaks to the difficulty of knowing our own limits when it comes to setting goals. Setting both easy and hard goals can be beneficial, as it challenges us to continuously work towards personal growth and development. Thus, by setting both easy and hard goals and knowing our limits, we can consistently strive for greater heights.. If we set goals that are too difficult, we may become frustrated and unhappy with our position. For example, if someone wished to become a professional musician, setting easier goals such as learning chords or chords progressions can provide the necessary foundation while still inspiring them to eventually reach their goal. It is often difficult to accurately gauge our own abilities and comparing them with the goals that we set for ourselves. Setting easy goals can create a scaffolding that will help to eventually create a larger structure', 'Beyond facing our own personal fears and challenges, we must also be prepared to encounter external hindrances such as limited resources, financial constraints, and the unexpected opposition of others. Achievers must be ready for long periods of hard work and dedication, as well as the frequent curve balls that life throws our way. \\n\\nThrough hardship and struggle come moments of triumph and reward. \\n\\nEvery individual journey is unique, because goals come in various shapes and sizes. \\n\\nIn conclusion, no success story is an overnight one. \\n    When it comes to achieving goals, the process is no easy feat. In such moments, we are often humbled by the people who believed in us, supportive of us, and pushed us to remain on track. Winston Churchill once famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” To truly achieve success, one must be willing to persevere through the difficult obstacles that stand in the way. While some goals may take days to accomplish, others may take years. After months or even years of hard work, reaching our goals can be one of the most fulfilling and rewarding experiences. Learning to navigate these situations with compassion and humility can be one of the greatest lessons on the road to success. Through this journey, we not only learn valuable lessons but also build character and develop greater resilience for the future.. Everyone’s journey to success shares a common formula: start with a goal in mind, brainstorm a plan of action, find the motivation to keep going, and learn from mistakes along the way. Most of all, we take pride in the idea that our hard work has paid off and our goals have been accomplished. The process of achieving goals is one that involves overcoming numerous difficulties, yet the rewards of success can be deeply gratifying and yield a sense of accomplishment and pride', 'A curfew could help improve sleep and focus during the day due to a healthier amount of rest.\\n\\nIn addition, the adoption of a curfew could encourage families to spend more time together. \\nParents of teenagers often have to juggle conflicting priorities. With a curfew, teenagers would be less likely to be involved in risky activities such as drinking, drug use, or criminal behavior. Adolescents need 8-11 hours of sleep a night, but many experience sleep deprivation due to poor sleep hygiene or staying up late on school nights. Furthermore, teens would be better able to plan which activities they could attend and which would have to be skipped. Establishing a regular curfew could help foster a stronger family bond during these critical teenage years.\\n\\nIn conclusion, implementing a 10 P.M weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers is beneficial for the overall physical and mental health of teenagers, as well as in improving their responsibility, decreasing their risk of late-night trouble, and increasing family time.. This teaches them how to be responsible and make choices within the given time and boundary constraints.\\n\\nReceiving adequate rest is also a key part of good decision-making. This could easily be prevented by having a structured time for when they should be returning home. On the other, they need to ensure their children are making good choices and staying safe. On one side, they want their children to experience the freedoms that come with growing up. A curfew could provide a balance by establishing reasonable expectations for when teenagers should be returning home.\\n\\nAdopting a 10 P.M weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers would help lead to improved responsibility and decreased risk of late-night trouble. By having their teenagers home by an early evening, parents would have the opportunity to have more meals together, engage in conversations, and play games', \"The debate of whether modern technology, such as the Internet, well ever replace the book or the written word as the main source of information has been a topic of discussion for many years. While modern technology has increased the reach of information, I do not believe that st well ever fully replace the book or the written word.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, books have been around for centuries, and with their physical form, have largely been the main source of information. This has allowed us to store vast amounts of knowledge and easily access st. Furthermore, books are more reliable as they are written and published by reputable authors and organizations. This allows us to trust the information they contain, which SS not necessarily the case with the Internet. The Internet SS often filled with unreliable sources and fake news, which can make finding accurate information difficult.\\n\\nAdditionally, books remain the best source of information for research. As most books are written by experts SN their respective fields, they often contain depth information that SS difficult to find online. For example, sf one SS looking to wrote a paper, they well likely find more reliable source material SN a book than they would online.\\n\\nIn addition, books provide a greater level of concentration. In today's world, with so many distractions, st can be difficult to stay focused on any one thing for a long period of time. With books, however, one can simply open the book and began to read without any worry of being distracted. This allows readers to immerse themselves SN the content and subsequently learn more from the material than they would sf they were using the computer.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while modern technology has increased the reach of information, I do not believe that st well ever fully replace the book or the written word. Books provide a reliable source of information, are better for research purposes, and provide a greater level of concentration. Therefore, I do not agree that modern technology well ever fully replace the book or the written word as the main source of information.\\n\\n\", \"Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. People get confused and don't get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say.\\n\\nAlthough I think it's nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. Make them regret what they said and go accomplish more.. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. I say this because people don't usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. People don't usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. You would never know what could come out someone's mouth.\\n\\nThey wouldn't want to agree with this but, that's because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. You don't need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day you're the only one who knows what you're accomplishing in life. I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. So what if they dislike your achievements? so what if they start doubting? prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success\", 'After a presidential election, citizens soon start to realize that their word doesn\\'t matter. The Electoral College are the voters that mean more to the presidential candidates, and it is a disrespectful system to be the face of ONR ways of democracy. In these sources citizens and governors want to abolish this system of voting and deciding a blind fate for America. The people vote for the electors not the president, the electors elect the president not the people, and the possibility of the disaster factor happening on entire elections. Popular vote doesn\\'t seem to have much of a purpose any more because the electors seem to be making the decisions in this country.\\n\\nStarting off, the people of this country need to know on what they are voting on rather from what they thought they could of been voting on. The Office of the Federal Register state,\" Yon help choose your state\\'s electors when yon vote for president\" source 1. They insist that we are basically voting for a possibility to get the candidate we want or to be betrayed and vote for the other party. Truly this means that this system is cheap and could backfire. Not only that BNT half or a little over half of citizens seem to take responsibility to vote, in that case it makes it harder to get the electoral votes to go in favor of popular votes. ONR votes only exist to help choose votes.\\n\\nAssisting the first claim, ONR votes are Nonexistent. Richard A. Poster claims,\"it is the electors who elect the president, not the people\" source 3. Right of the bat the Constitution, and its preamble is disrespected by this system. The preamble says that we as citizens of this country are the voice of this land and would further on insist or choose what we want it to be known as. BNT, that can\\'t necessarily happen if we don\\'t vote. Poster also says\" and that trust is rarely betrayed\" source 3. Even though this is a fact there is still the possibility or the potential to be nailed or betrayed by the electors. If there is a possibility in something Unfair to happen by law it should be taken down and changed for ONR safety. Yet this happened in 2000, when W. Bush acquired more electoral votes than Gore BNT Gore had more popular votes. A plurality only has a chance to win electoral votes.\\n\\nAdditionally, the system could explosively allow for much worse tricks and grief. Bradford Player describes \"The single best argument against the electoral college is what we might call the disaster factor\" source 2. The disaster factor includes legislatures replacing the Democratic electors with new ones and this happened in the 2000 fiasco. This is where the popular votes and higher that the electoral votes given to the president. Knowing that the legislatures could successfully replace or revise or votes into the opposing party. Voting campaigns seem to just be a game, the electors want to win, so 17 sates didn\\'t even have the chance to see the candidates at all. This is the system suggested by ONR founding fathers, and it is a mockery to let it stay and bring judgement to ONR votes.\\n\\nIt is humorous to and Unfair to see the electoral college take over ONR votes. It seems that ONR votes are only seen as jokes. As if the whole preamble was a way to joke around with the citizens and give them hope. Many governors want to Abolish the electoral college, and most of NS should take responsibility to vote for this and dismantle the electoral college from ever taking over ONR voice. The disaster factor, the way on how the electors decide, and how we vote for the electors not the president, are prime examples on how irrational this system is. The only way to get ONR voice back is to abolish it and start over fresh with a new system in mind.', \"Graduating early from a more advanced program can be beneficial in some cases, with the potential to put a student ahead of their peers in gaining experience and potential scholarships.

Driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, are rapidly advancing in technology, and it seems like they will soon become a common sight on our roads. This essay will discuss the potential benefits and challenges of driverless cars.\\n\\nBenefits of Driverless Cars:\\n1. Safety: Driverless cars use a combination of cameras, radars, and sensors to detect obstacles, traffic signals, and other vehicles. This advanced technology significantly reduces the risk of accidents caused by human error.\\n2. Efficiency: Driverless cars have the potential to optimize traffic flow, reducing congestion and improving fuel efficiency. They can communicate with each other and adjust their speed accordingly, minimizing stop-and-go traffic and reducing the overall commute time.\\n3. Accessibility: Driverless cars have the potential to provide greater mobility for individuals with disabilities or elderly people. They don't require manual driving skills and can be programmed to accommodate specific needs.\\n4. Environmental Impact: Autonomous vehicles can help decrease pollution, as they may be designed for better fuel consumption and reduced idling time.\\n\\nChallenges of Driverless Cars:\\n1. Technical Issues: Despite advancements in technology, there are still potential issues that need to be addressed, such as system failures or cybersecurity threats.\\n2. Legal and Regulatory Issues: The legal framework for autonomous vehicles is still being developed, and it's essential to ensure proper regulations are established.\\n3. Public Acceptance: People are naturally hesitant about giving up control of their cars, and it might take time for society to adapt to driverless vehicles.\\n\\nIn conclusion, driverless cars have the potential to revolutionize the way we travel, offering increased safety, efficiency, accessibility, and environmental benefits. However, there are also challenges to overcome, including technical issues, legal and regulatory hurdles, and public acceptance. As the technology evolves further, it's important to address these challenges and ensure that driverless cars are implemented responsibly and safely.\", \"Research has shown that the benefits of graduating early include a greater likelihood of continuing a higher education, more time to explore interests and hobbies, and improved job prospects for the future. Benefits such as more available time to pursue higher education and professional endeavors, give early graduates a great starting point.. With an extra year or two to spare, many early graduates go on to attend trade schools, universities, or pursue creative interests without the pressure of finishing a diploma. \\nGraduating early from high school can lead to greater success in the long run. Being able to land an internship soon after graduating early was difficult, but the time I had to prepare made it possible for me to stand out during the interviewing process. Furthermore, this extra time is beneficial in exploring internships and other professional opportunities that aren't available to traditional students.\\n\\nI can personally attest to these advantages, as I was able to use my extra time to gain experience in my field by training in a professional agency. By putting myself in this position, I believe I had an edge alongside other graduating high school peers.\\n\\nOverall, graduating high school early can be a great way to increase success later on. \\n\\nFor example, graduating from high school early is a surefire way to get a head start on your college career\", 'It can help enforce healthy bedtimes and routines, and reduce the risk of teens engaging in dangerous activities. Furthermore, by helping to reduce the risk of illegal and unsafe activities, the city can benefit from having a curfew in place.. Furthermore, teens who stay out late into the night are at an increased risk for developing mental and physical health problems due to poor sleep or irregular sleep patterns.\\n\\nImplementing a curfew can help keep teens from troulbe by helping them establish healthy and realistic routines. Having a curfew can help teens prioritize important tasks and activities like completing homework and chores, as well as spending time with friends and family. Not following a curfew can also lead to poor academic performance as teens may be too tired or distracted to focus on their studies. \\nResearch has shown that when teenagers do not follow curfew, the consequences can be severe. In addition, enforcing a curfew can reduce the risk of teens engaging in risky or illegal behaviour, as well as protect them from hazards like accidents due to tiredness.\\n\\nOverall, having a curfew is an important part of keeping teens safe. Setting a curfew can also provide teens with the structure and discipline they need to lead successful lives. Teens who do not abide by curfews often find themselves engaging in risky and potentially dangerous behaviour such as vandalism, drinking, and drug use', \"Having to wake up early and get ready on time is hard work,making it on time to school is a big task. Just having online classes from home would be better for everyone in general, would honestly make students life much more easier. Another reason why it would be better would be because, some students work in their own speed and won't be worried about how fast others finish. Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think it's a race. Falling asleep in class effects on class grades because student pay less attention. Students would benefit attending school from home in many ways.... Online school should just be a thing for students because its less stressful and much easier.. students would be able to work in a quiet environment with no distractions from other students. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster.

It is generally accepted that both biological and environmental influences play a role in the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. \\n\\nThough definitive answers remain elusive, it is important to recognize that both our genetic makeup and our environment contribute to our character. Our individual traits have been deeply affected by the experiences and behaviours we have been exposed to, while also relying on the biological foundations we have been given. Biological influences, such as our genetic makeup, play an important role in how we have been hardwired. Understanding the complexities of this relationship can help us to better understand ourselves, and how our character is formed.. On the other hand, environmental influences, such as our upbringing, the people around us, and our experiences, often shape the way we think and behave. \\n\\nUltimately, it is likely that a combination of both nature and nurture are what contributes to our character. \\nThe debate between nature versus nurture in determining our character traits is one that has long been discussed, and it is difficult to come to a right or wrong conclusion.

I\\'ll be giving my reason and also Luke\\'s reasons to support my claim. Furthermore, I will be arguing on why others should join the program.\\n\\nOthers should join the program because you get to travel around the world. Luke stated that he went to China and Europe! He traveled the Pacific and Atlantis ocean several times. He\\'s been to Greece. If you like to travel, this would be a great program to join.\\n\\nLuke feeds and waters the animals. Luke has to check on the animals every hour. I would join this program because I\\'m an animal person and I would love to spend weeks, maybe even months with these animals.

It would be a great way to interact with the animals if you don\\'t like animals all that much.\\n\\nJoining this program could teach you something. It could teach you many things. It could teach you to be more cautious about things. As Luke stated \"It made me more aware of people of other countries and their needs.\" This program can make you more grateful for everything. It could make you work harder instead of being lazy. You could actually get things done if you were to join this program. That is why I think you should join.', '\\n\\n While contemplating the seemingly unrelated yet unique combination of ideas, a cowboy and someone who rides waves, it could be challenging to imagine how they could possibly overlap. However, unconventional relationships often lead to fascinating discoveries with the potential to shape new perspectives. In this essay, we\\'ll dive deep into the world of \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\" by exploring the remarkable life of a pioneering adventurer who managed to blend elements of both iconic American themes.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBorn with a rebellious spirit and a passion for change, young Jack Randall had little interest in the traditional ways of life expected of someone within the boundaries of his time. He came to embrace challenges and pushed against the stifling cultural norms surrounding him. In his quest to forge his own path, he ventured into the unpredictable wilderness of two distinct yet equally captivating areas – the plains of the American West and the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n Jack Randall\\'s journey would lead him across both the Wild West and the seas, merging the seemingly contrasting identities of the cowboy and a wave rider, eventually creating a legacy that transcended his individual experiences and left an indelible mark.\\n\\n\\nDespite the limitations of a rigid caste system that restricted him based on his lineage, Randall dreamed of a life far beyond the boundaries of the aristocratic society that confined him. His ambitions carried him across the rugged terrain of the American wilderness, where he embraced the essence of the iconic western cowboy: living on the edge - fearless, hardworking, and fiercely independent.\\n\\n Randall\\'s journey started with the wild horses of Texas, leading to an enduring love for the open range of the Wild West. Yet, his quest for adventure took him across the vast landscape of the American West, eventually finding the cowboy, and all the freedom, camaraderie, and hard work it encompassed.\\n\\n\\nWith the unyielding desire for self-improvement and growth at his core, Jack Randall\\'s aspirations continued to broaden. Overwhelmed with the thirst for exploration and a search for otherworldly encounters, he set out to the unfamiliar and dangerous confines of the Pacific Ocean. His fascination with the waves and the promise of discovery made him realize that there was more to him than even he himself could imagine. \\n\\n In his quest to find the elusive balance between a life as a cowboy and the inherent lure of the open ocean, Randall embarked on a journey that would propel him towards self-discovery and understanding, as well as provide him an opportunity to merge the once-opposing identities of the cowboy and the person who rode the waves.\\n\\n\\nOnce he stepped into the world of wave riding, Jack Randall discovered a newfound passion, an unexpected affinity for the power and raw energy of the ocean. By embracing the art of surfing and sailing, this resilient figure from the American plains successfully integrated both facets of his personality, seamlessly blending the spirit and skills of a cowboy with the daring and thrill of a wave rider. Through sheer determination, Randall defied any expectations placed upon him and forged an identity unique to his own story and journey.\\n\\n Despite the difficulties he faced merging these two contrasting identities, Jack Randall\\'s relentless pursuit of personal growth and self-discovery led him to embody the spirit of a \\'cowboy who rode the waves\\' – an adventurer without limits, an embodiment of duality and a testament to the power of breaking boundaries.\\n\\n\\nIn the end, Jack Randall\\'s story echoes an important message to all of us who are often confined by societal expectations and self-imposed barriers. Life has innumerable unknowns and opportunities that can only be uncovered when we open ourselves to the thralls of curiosity, self-expression, and exploration. It speaks to the power of forging one\\'s path, challenging cultural norms, and the triumph of transcending the confines of tradition to carve a unique identity that honors one\\'s individual spirit and passions.\\n\\n In the tale of the cowboy who rode the waves, we witness the journey of an artist pushing beyond all limitations to create a harmonious whole, transcending the individualistic elements of his identities to form a singular, unforgettable expression of self.', 'The author AIEMA to be an advocate for studying Venue despite ITA danger, and even given some idea AA to how human could study Venue without ever touching the extremely volatile surface.

I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. Like for example let\\'s say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. Let\\'s say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.\\n\\nThere still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.\\n\\nConcluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.\\n\\nBy taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says \"distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing\". Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. Another thing is the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.\\n\\nThe benefits that you get does not end there.           ', \"We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day that's mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school.\\n\\nWe would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more.\\n\\nWe might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things.          . I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school.\\n\\nSome people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didn't get the grade for the project. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now.\\n\\nFinally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that we're using right now. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment\", \"Additionally, working in groups can foster important social skills such as communication and teamwork, while reducing feelings of isolation and loneliness that can often occur when working alone. Finally, the development of friendships and shared experiences through working in a group setting can foster positive emotions and boost morale, which can create an overall positive learning experience. Collaborating and sharing tasks with fellow students can often lead to higher academic success due to the division of labor and increased opportunities for problem-solving. Additionally, finding solutions that work for everyone is vital to ensure that the group's objectives are met.\\n\\nIn conclusion, group work provides students with numerous benefits, such as increased academic performance, improved social skills, and strengthened friendships. While working in a group setting can have its unique challenges, the advantages of group work far outweigh its drawbacks.. \\nWorking in a group setting provides a multitude of advantages, particularly in the academic setting. \\n\\nWhen working in a group, it is important to find the right balance between collaboration and division of labor, in order to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency of the group\", \"for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Having you wonder why people able to accomplish so much just in few days? Today society people always works so much they miss out their opportunity in life. Another example I wasn't good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to\\n\\nI decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful\\n\\nIt is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasn't good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft.\\n\\nBill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He was successful because he always like to do somethings\\n\\nBill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned.\\n\\nAnother example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasn't good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them.\\n\\nMy uncle now files tax people get pay a lots;\\n\\nwhen people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English.  . I use thought that wasn't at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs. Never stop trying something new in life it will turn out be more successful then you never to be expected. She always practical how to read in English and write English. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish.\\n\\nFinally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. This show that\\n\\nIt is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience.\\n\\nThe other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.\\n\\nIt is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful\", 'It can be seen in the workplace, school, and at home, and is key in creating a safe and positive atmosphere for those around us.

If students don't eat the food served in the cafeteria, they may not be getting the proper nutrition they need throughout the day. While this can be a good way to cut costs, there are also potential negative outcomes to consider. This could potentially lead to diminished morale and a less positive school environment. \\n\\nIn conclusion, before making any changes to cafeteria food, school administrators must weigh the potential positives against the potential negatives.. Furthermore, if students are not fully nourished, it could potentially lead to poorer academic performance.\\n\\nAnother potential outcome is that the quality of the food offered may decrease, leading to unhealthy eating habits. Food that is low in nutrition and high in unhealthy ingredients can not only be detrimental to physical health, but can also impact students' mental health and wellbeing\", \"But,not only you but the others in the surrounding Therefore, being nice and kind to others helps the way people look and act when they show their first impressions to others.\\n\\nFirst of all, first impressions not only are by judged by the person of a face but ,can sometimes leave a good mark or bad one because the way people look and the attitude they give. So that's why we as persons have to be the that lead the next generation and with a good personality.. Otherwise, when meeting with them later in the future they will regret to have spoken and talken to you because lack of behavior. maybe so later in life you can become someone and treat others the way you treat yourself. Therefore, people will comprehend the way you feel about others and how you treat them. So that your family and friends can be proud of who you are and realize who you've become as a person. For example. Then realize that first impressions always count as a good way to introduce yourself to others.\\n\\nTo summarize, the person who you are today is the person that can be later in life. Next time think of what positive things to share around and impressions to others.\\n\\nSecondly, sometimes its impossible to change impressions and thats why we think before we speak. So maybe think before what you're going to say because it affects your life. So maybe think clearly andi treat others the way they do to others. First impressions always count no matter what and sometimes even impossible to change. Thats why first impressions always count no matter what and where you are and how you act as a person. One way by noticing is when meeting a new person and by their first impression. But, when meeting a new employee there was a guy and I introduced myself to him and he had just passed by without saying anything and was shocked when that happened.. when meeting a new employee at my job employees have to introduce themselves to each others so that they can create a long-lasting relationship. Not only that but it also say a lot about people and you. Its says a lot by just looking at their behavior and attitude not only because the way they speak but interact with others. Being kind and generous to others can affect the world by a lot not only by being kind but can help the people around you. Just by having a good impression of yourself people can take it to other good ways in life. Because, when meeting new people you have to introduce yourself to others like any other person in the world. Then, treat other with respect and kindness so that many others can spread positive things in life. For example,if a women would like to apply for a new job and talked to the manager in a rudely manner her way of speaking and acting would affect her opportunity of working. Not only because their new but it helps people interact with each other.\\n\\nLastly, being able to give the first impression to others means a lot because it represents who you really are and the person you want to be. Because,when meeting a new person or family member people judge on how people tend to act and speak. Sometimes that's why when people are going to give a first impression it has to be a clear and nice way so that the other gives back to people\", '\\nIn recent years, public school systems have been forced to make difficult decisions regarding the budget allocated to school sports teams. . Additionally, the policy could increase school participation and engagement among students who are less athletically inclined, thus boosting morale and school spirit.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the policy could place a strain on school budgets due to the need for additional facilities and equipment. Moreover, the policy could also take away from essential resources such as teacher salaries and classroom materials. In order to maximize the impact of available resources, many schools are turning to a potential new policy that would provide equal access for all students who wish to participate in sports programs, while recognizing that not all students are competitive athletes.\\n\\nFrom the student perspective, the new policy would be advantageous in that it could potentially provide more opportunities to develop communication and teamwork skills, while also teaching the value of healthy competition. Teachers may find it difficult to provide equal attention and motivation to all athletes.\\n\\nUltimately, the new policy could potentially benefit some schools, resulting in increased school spirit and greater access to sports. However, the disadvantages should be carefully considered before instituting such a policy', 'And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go', 'Cars are an everyday thing, you need the to get to work, to school, to pick up your kids, but what happens when the cars drive themselves? People have long dressed of cars that drive themselves, but most people don\\'t know that google has had the since 2009. Those cars aren\\'t completely independent, they need a version to control the, or rather \"help\" the, like on high traffic areas, or around crashes. There are any advantages and disadvantages to the automatic car, but should we have the? Well, there are any reasons we should.\\n\\nIts no surprise that every single car is as safe as finicky potable. At Google, there cars have driven half a million miles without a crash. that\\'s because every car is completely loaded with fencers to keep that from happening, let alone the version in control of the car. Another amazing feature this car has is that you can not use the automatic drive without both hands on the wheel, so the driver must pay stenton. That also sake sit disposable for texting at the wheel.\\n\\nIts no secret that acoustic cars are the future, with its advanced safety features and its convenience. All this car really needs is support. Tons of people are completely against this idea of cars driving themselves, but they have no reason to. It\\'s safer, and easier. This car will only get better with time, so hopefully, everyone will come around in time. So know you know what happens when cars can drive themselves, the real question is, will SY story drive you?', \"Even if you seat one what are going to do by listing to an online school site.

NASA and conspiracy theorists totally know what you are going through. NASA found a\\n\\n\"Face on Mars\" and now everyone thinks it has something to do with aliens. Well, they are very wrong. NASA would have benefitted from the \"Face of Mars\" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998, snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless suffer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics fay have their points on to why its fay be created by aliens, but NASA has three amazing photos to prove the wrong. The Face on Mars is not really a face after all.\\n\\nTo begin, NASA\\'s budget would have benefitted a lot if the landform had anything to do with aliens at all, so why would they want to keep it a secret if it were true? First things first, When NASA revealed the photo of the huge landforfation it became a huge hit! They were hoping to Fatah the attention of Mars to the public, and boy oh boy, they did just that. It starred in a Hollywood movie, appeared in magazines, books, radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Unfortunately, the positive popularity always phones with the negative. Some conspiracy theorists thought that the Face was bona fide evidence of life on Mars, evidence that NASA would rather hide. Defenders of NASA\\'s budget fan only wish that there was an ancient civilization on Mars.\\n\\nSecondly, on April 5, 1998, Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia, the section on Mars where \"The Face\" lives, snapped a picture of it ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. The picture proves again that the face is just a landform. The conspiracy theorists and people that supported their opinion were still not happy with the results. They said in paragraph 8, \"The camera on board MGS had to peer through wispy clouds to see the Face. Perhaps, said skeptics, alien markings were hidden by haze.\" I don\\'t know how they get these crazy assumptions, but they will just never give up! They went all the way back to take a second picture to prove they\\'re wrong, don\\'t you think that shows that nothing about this landform is alien infested, or was created by the?\\n\\nLast, but not least, They took a second picture of \"The Face\" at the highest resolution possible to prove to the opposing side again. we had to roll the spacecraft 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view, \\x94 said Gavin. Marines team captured an extraordinary photo using the cameras absolute maximum resolution.\\x94 Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo. Gavin proved the Forrest point for everyone, hopefully having everyone believing that \"The Face\" is not a face, just a lava done.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the other side had a bit of detail to help support their side as well. Their first assumption was that in the second photo, wispy clouds covered any alien like markings. To prove that wrong NASA took another photo at the highest resolution to prove that it is just a natural landform on Mars that has nothing to do with aliens. The skeptics will probably never give up on how this was faded by aliens, but NASA has three extraordinary photos to prove the wrong every single time.\\n\\nIn conclusion, \"The Face\" is just a natural landform. NASA would have benefitted from the \"Face of Mars\" if aliens had anything to do with it, NASA took a picture on April 5, 1998, snapping a higher resolution picture, and on April 8, 2001, they took a picture at the sharpest point on a cloudless suffer day, proving for the second time that it was just a landform. The skeptics fan try to find every way to show that aliens had something to do with it, but they don\\'t have three pictures of the landform itself. Real facts beat assumptions every time. Mars fay be a mysterious place, but what isn\\'t mysterious is the natural landform on Colonia. ', 'Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources.\\n\\nFirst, conserve energy and resources through extend the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need those resources in the community. For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. Thus, conserving energy and resources following the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully way for emergency school situations.\\n\\nConversely, some people may claim that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not conserve energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources with this two more hours. It could be helpful for community needs and emergency situations in the school area. However, following this model, by extending the school two hours would conserve energy and resources for school area and community. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. It can be a form to give necessary resources for whom need it in the community. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Conserve energy and resources through this model could be a helpfully way for the school. Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community.\\n\\nSecond, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs. Therefore, adopting the model by extending the school day two hours can be a helpfully method to support the school area and the community.\\n\\nIn conclusion, to conserve energy and resources, some businesses adopted a four day work week,each day consisting of ten hours. This conserve energy and resources could be a way to support the school and the community. In other hands, some people may argue that follow this model by extending the school day two hours would not be a conserve form for energy and resources because the school will still consuming this energy and resources. Thus, following this model, by extending the school day two hours will be a helpfully way to support emergencies situations in the school area and support community needs.. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. Conserving Energy and Resources\\n\\nTo conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. It can be a support form for the community area. However, it can be true, but to retake my point, following this model by extending the school day two hours would conserve energy and resources. For example, at Generic_City occurred a strong earthquake at the beginning of this year. The school could follows this model by extending the school day two hours because it can be a helpfully way to support the school area in emergency situations. In other words, by extending the school day two hours and conserve energy and resources ,they were supported with this conserved energy and resources in this emergency situation. Generic_School was one of the school which adopted and follows the model to conserve energy and resources, as a result they were supported in their necessities in this disaster', \"Art cost a lot of money but some people don't sale their art, because they want to keep it for memory or because they want to show it to their family and sometimes they sale it to their family, but they don'tsale it for billions or millions of dollars,because it's for their family.

Many residents in Vauban, Germany feel that going without a car was the best decision they have ever made. The reason why they feel that way is because of this quote \"large garages at the edge of the development, where a car owner buys a space, for $40,000, Along with a home.\" This quote is basically saying that many residents in Germany would be spending over millions of dollars for a house and most of the money would be on one parking space that they necessarily don\\'t need. To all you fellow citizens out there thinking if I should limit my car usage or just keeping driving in a car paying for gas every day. From my point of view I don\\'t everybody needs a car. Some people just buy cars just to show not knowing the reasons for having a car. Jar use up a lot of gas and cars pollute the air really badly. \"After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\" This quote is basically showing that many cars in Paris have been polluting the air making it hard for others to survive.  ', 'It implies that each person is ultimately in control of their character and behavior, and it is their decisions that determine what kind of person they become. Additionally, those around them can pressure them to act in certain ways, and it often requires strength to defy these pressures and stay true to one’s values.\\n\\nOverall, it is important to remember that while people should strive to be in control of the person they want to be, they must also recognize that the environment they live in can influence their character significantly. \\n\\nFor example, a person may be raised in a household where they see particular behaviors modeled, either positive or negative. \\nThe statement \"Your character will be what yourself choose to make it\" is a powerful idea that is worth considering. However, it is important to acknowledge that this view ignores the fact that people are heavily influenced by those around them, and their environment can have a significant impact on their character. It is possible to be strongly impacted by those around us, both positively and negatively, and it is our decisions that will determine whether we are actively resisting or submitting to these influences.. This can have a lasting effect on their character, as the things they observe can shape their beliefs and values', \"Summer vacation is a time of rest, relaxation, and recreation for public school students across the nation. However, this break is also well-known for creating significant academic setbacks for these students and causing them to struggle in their return to school. To solve this common issue, many schools have started to require their students to complete a summer project in order to maintain their academics outside of school. Although these products would be more educationally beneficial for the students if constructed by the teachers, the summer products should be student made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to do a high quality project are increased.\\n\\nTo begin with, the summer break products should be constructed by the students because they are more likely to enjoy the project. In today's society, many students enjoy creating things that they thought of themselves and were not assigned by a teacher or parent. Consequently, if these products were created by teachers, the students would say that the topic that the teachers selected for the project was not interesting enough and would not be as motivated to complete the assignment. If these products were created by the students, they would not feel forced to do the project. Instead, they would leave for summer vacation already anticipating starting this fun and exciting new activity. In conclusion, schools should allow students to create their own summer project because the students are more likely to enjoy it.\\n\\nIn addition, the allowance of a student constructed summer project would increase the probability of completion by the students. If the students are permitted to complete a project of their own invention, their motivation to do it will increase because they are guaranteed to enjoy the topic of the project. Teacher constructed products are not likely to suit the interests of each of their students. This results in a percentage of the students not enjoying the topic of the project, losing motivation to do what was assigned, and eventually not completing the project at all. This can be avoided if the topic of the summer project was student selected because each student would be doing something that they are interested in. To conclude, students should be allowed to select their own summer project instead of the teachers selecting it because their motivation to complete the project is guaranteed to increase significantly.\\n\\nFinally, schools should permit students to pick their own summer project because the chance that students will construct a project of higher quality will increase. Students completing a project that they are interested in are proven to spend more time and effort on their assignment. Forcing students to construct a project that they are not interested in is the easiest way to receive a low quality project. In order to prevent students from creating an unambitious and lazily made project, schools should permit students to choose what project they will be doing. This ensures that every student is doing something that they will be guaranteed to enjoy. To summarize, the allowance of student constructed products increases the probability that schools will receive high quality products on their return.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the summer products should be student made because the students are more likely to enjoy the project, there is a higher probability of the students completing the project, and the efforts of the students to complete a high quality project are increased. The products mandated by these schools will create a new generation of inquisitive and ambitious students. The students who complete these interactive and enjoyable products are more probable to enjoy school on their return and have an increase in motivation and ambition regarding their academics. Allowing the students to construct these summer break products instead of the teachers is the best possible decision that America's schools could ever make for the future generations of today's society.\", \"Make sure to pay close attention to the instructor and practice the moves accurately.

Cities and suburbs are populated with extensive parking areas and highways, designed to accommodate automobile use. However, there is a shift towards limiting car usage due to numerous socioeconomic and environmental benefits as demonstrated by examples from Germany, France, Colombia, and the United States.\\n\\nIn Vauban, an experimental suburb in Germany, the idea of “smart planning” takes center stage as residents give up on cars, leading to a more peaceful, tension free community (Rosenthal, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" 14). Chi has become possible through a city layout with reduced space for cars and widespread public transportation systems. Che\\'s focus is on making suburbs more compact and bring shops a walkaway, which not only improves accessibility but also significantly reduces greenhouse emissions from cars (Rosenthal, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" 57).\\n\\nIn Paris, smog pollution led authorities to enforce a partial driving ban during a day, creating a significant reduction in congestion and demonstrating an approach to smog reduction (Duffer, “Paris bans driving due to smog” 10, 14). Similarly, in Colombia, the annual carefree day when only buses and taxis are allowed has played a vital role in promoting alternative transportation and reducing smog (Silky, \"Carefree day is spinning into a big hit in Bogotá\" 21, 2324). \\n\\nAmerican cities too are witnessing change. Chair has been a decline in car purchasing and more people are driving less (Rosenthal, \"Che End of Car Culture\" 2930), largely due to changing social attitudes and improved public transportation. With this shift, the demand for cars is likely going to decrease further, while encouraging a long term cultural shift of less car usage (Rosenthal, \"Che End of Car Culture\" 3435).\\n\\nTherefore, limiting car usage brings a multitude of benefits. One of the main advantages is the significant environmental impact. Car emissions are one of the major contributors to harmful greenhouse gases, causing global warming and air pollution (Rosenthal, \"In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars\" 5). Reducing car usage benefits not only the environment but also public health, as demonstrated by the decreased smog levels in Paris and Bogotá. \\n\\nSocioeconomically, mobility shifts within communities also lead to changes in living habits that promote healthier, more active lifestyles, driving positive community bonds. Opportunities for businesses to thrive are also visible, with public transport facilities, carpooling apps and car sharing programs becoming more appealing in a car reduced society (Rosenthal, \"Che End of Car Culture\" 37). \\n\\nIn sum, severely reducing car usage leads to healthier, more sustainable, and more cohesive cities and suburbs. Although these adjustments may seem challenging, the adoption of public transport services and smart planning, supplemented by forward looking regulations and policies can make the transition smooth and beneficial, nudging us towards a greener, healthier and more resilient future.', 'Employers often look for candidates who bring a sense of positive energy to their job. In addition to making you more resilient in the face of adversity, a good attitude provides other internal benefits such as improved self-confidence and better mental and emotional resilience.\\n\\nIn an organizational context, having a good attitude can also help you get ahead. Having a good attitude and willingness to work hard can make you a more desirable candidate in the job market.\\n\\nLikewise, research has shown that having a good attitude can promote stronger and more lasting relationships. It is important to remember that attitude is something you can train yourself to have, and it can take time to shift your outlook and begin seeing the world in a more positive light.. People tend to be drawn to those who are optimistic and have a good attitude, as it helps create a more enjoyable atmosphere and avoids unnecessary conflicts.\\n\\nThere are numerous examples of well known people who have experienced success in life despite having a disagreeable attitude. Researchers have found that people who display a positive attitude reap many benefits beyond just having a better outlook on life. \\nHaving a good attitude can have profoundly positive effects on your life and your success. However, it is important to remember that attitude is essential in accomplishing goals and striving for success. Having a good attitude can mean getting things easier and achieving a higher level of success', \"As another example, if a person choose his career by the advises of authorities or experts he may not enjoy the job that the get in the future and that could result in depression.

It can be difficult to come to terms with failure, since it often serves as a reminder of our own personal shortcomings. As a student, it was only upon getting a failing grade on an assignment that I understood the importance of studying thoroughly and engaging deeply with every learning module. Whether it is seen as an opportunity for growth or a sign of defeat is ultimately in our hands. \\n\\nHowever, there are still those who feel that failure should be shied away from, in order to maintain a feeling of invincibility. In this sense, failure had provided me the extra push to strive towards bettering myself. Yet, it is only through embracing failure that we can truly grow and become better versions of ourselves. Despite this, there are still those who maintain that it should be avoided at all costs. \\n\\nIn the end, it is up to each of us to determine how we confront failure and learn from it. We must acknowledge that it is part and parcel of life, and that it can be used to become a successful person. \\nFailure can be an intimidating concept for many, yet it is essential to our growth as people', '\\n\\nThree key effects of having a cellphone in the classroom are decreased attention to the teacher, inappropriate usage for non-educational purposes, and disruption of the classroom environment. \\n\\nCellphones in the classroom can have a marked effect on student success, both positive and negative. Finally, when the classroom environment is consistently disrupted by the noise and visual distraction that accompanying cellphone use, the learning experience is compromised. Rather, phones should be used for academic pursuits with caution, in order to maximize the positive impact to academic success.. Although having a tool for information available can be beneficial, it can also be a distraction from the important task at hand—learning and engaging in academic pursuits. \\n\\nAlthough there are potential benefits of having a cellphone in the classroom, people should not use cellphones for non-educational purposes. Not listening to the teacher eliminates the opportunity to learn and participate in a meaningful way, leading to decreased academic success. Additionally, if students are using their phone for non-educational purposes, such as playing games or sending messages, this takes away from focus on educational tasks', 'When it comes to holiday greetings, many people are inclined to go with electronic cards in lieu of paper cards. This is due to the fact that electronic cards are supposedly more environmentally friendly, as they do not require the use of paper to produce them. However, many people feel that electronic cards do not have the same flavor as paper cards and do not display the same function. For example, paper cards can be used as a bookmark, while electronic cards are not as versatile. Additionally, paper cards can be personalized, while electronic cards generally are not.\\n\\nWhile there are some advantages to electronic cards, there are also a number of disadvantages. For example, electronic cards are often less customizable, which can made them less personal. Additionally, electronic cards are often less durable than paper cards, which can lead to them being lost or damaged over time. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide whether they prefer electronic cards or paper cards for their holiday greetings.\\n\\n', \"we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain.\\n\\nEvery country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and that's why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and won't fail no more next school season.\\n\\nFamily over school, family is the most important thing, i'm don't know anyone that dont like his families members, so let's said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then let's agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level.\\n\\ni'm sure that they have families and have to rest. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you don't need in a real life, that's why it's not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life.\\n\\nFirst of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and don't want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. for example; let's take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so that's kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you don't have any interest in or you don't like at all, it's not good. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends.\\n\\nSecond think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, that's all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didn't get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break.\\n\\nso some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that.\\n\\nThird thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. what, that's insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation\", '\\nOur enthusiasm is one of the most important catalysts in achieving success. This anecdote illustrates how failure can sometimes be a necessary step to reach success. Overcoming failure strengthens our resilience and provides opportunities to learn from our mistakes and improve. With enthusiasm in our hearts and an open mind to failure, we will have the resources to succeed.. After all, if you lack passion in pursuing your goals, it will become increasingly difficult to stay motivated along the journey. \\n\\nTherefore, we must embrace failure wholeheartedly and not be scared of the roadblocks that are put in our way. We must actively seek out opportunities, try new things, and create a culture of innovation and risk-taking. In addition to enthusiasm, the willingness to accept failure plays an equally important role in succeeding. This can be seen in the history of many of our most successful innovators. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed 1,000 times in his attempt to invent the lightbulb, but he persevered and eventually succeeded. Learning to accept failure can help us grow and provide us with valuable lessons to learn from', 'Some people effort to do their best and not be dependent for someone. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.\\n\\nIn conclusion individuality make people be themselves and they can effort to be the greatest accomplishment. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.\\n\\nIn the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Some people rather be individuality because they didn\\'t like the opinion of others.\\n\\nTo begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. For example, \"those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves.\" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. For instance, \"When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively.\" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others\\' do. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.\\n\\nsecondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. Being individuality people became to learn many things. \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you someone else is the greatest accomplishment.\"-By Ralph Waldo Emerson. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.. However, that is not true because be individual make\\'s people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others\\' believe for us', 'Title: Libraries in the Digital Age\\n\\nAs a student in grade 7, I have been exposed to both traditional libraries and digital libraries. While digital libraries have become increasingly popular due to their convenience and accessibility, I strongly believe that traditional libraries still play an essential role in our society.\\n\\nFirstly, traditional libraries provide access to a wide range of physical resources such as books, journals, and other reference materials which cannot be replicated in the digital realm. These resources offer readers a unique experience of flipping through pages, smelling the scent of old books, and feeling the texture of paper. This sensory experience cannot be replicated by digital devices, making traditional libraries irreplaceable.\\n\\nSecondly, traditional libraries serve as community centers where people can gather, study, and exchange ideas. They offer a quiet and peaceful environment conducive to learning and research. Furthermore, they host various events like book clubs, writing workshops, and author talks, fostering a sense of community among patrons.\\n\\nLastly, not everyone has access to digital devices or internet connectivity, making traditional libraries crucial for those who cannot afford these luxuries. For instance, many students from low income families rely on school and public libraries for their educational needs. Without these institutions, they would lack the necessary resources to succeed academically.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while digital libraries do offer certain advantages, they cannot entirely replace traditional libraries. The unique experiences, community engagement, and accessibility provided by traditional libraries make them invaluable in the digital age. Therefore, we must continue to support and invest in our local libraries to ensure they remain relevant and beneficial to all members of society.', 'Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.\\n\\nSecondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Likewise, many people belive that \" Determine never to be idle ... Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing\". For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.\\n\\nFirstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.\\n\\nTherefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.\\n\\nIn conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done', \"As such, it is often better to develop and trust the wisdom of your own judgement than to rely solely on the opinions of others.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that instinct and ideas should only be used as a tool to make better and more informed decisions. Striking a balance between the two is essential in ensuring that your actions are guided by sound judgement and rationale.\\n\\nTherefore, while gathering external guidance and considering the opinions of others should not be disregarded, it is important to remember that following your own instincts and ideas is often the best way to ensure the most satisfying and rewarding life.. \\nIn today's world, the importance of following one's instincts and ideas cannot be understated. Following someone else's ideas can prevent you from discovering solutions and opportunities that align with your best interests. Believing in oneself can be key to realising one's full potential and ensuring the most rewarding life experience.\\n\\nRelying on external guidance and advice is a natural chip in the process of forming decisions, but in the end, it is your choices that will shape the life you create for yourself. Too much focus on one's own desires and impulses can lead to imprudent choices and dire consequences. Whether it involves deciding how to pursue a career, form a relationship, or plan for the future, trusting your own judgment is a cornerstone of successful decision-making\", 'The positive attitude is the key to success in the life, because a person with good attitude good energy always is accepted, a person with positive attitude always is happy, because they believe thta everything is possible, that people with good energy they trasmite good energy to everyone around they, the positive attitude os the key to success in here reasons why: More effective in the job,\\n\\nbetter relationship with family and friends and good life in general.\\n\\nPositive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name.\\n\\nA person with positive attitude is a support, for example: Generic_Name have a big problem, but Generic_Name have a friend and her friend is her support, because with somebody is in problems need friends with good energy positive attitude. All the people say In the life all have to be positive because if i have to do something and i do my best with my best attitude, im going to be fine with the result, because i give everything. People with positive attitude always have good friends, because they listen that problems and them say All is going to be fine just wait for the right time.\\n\\nMy mom always say Believe in God and be positive.\\n\\nAfter the rain the calm come. All the people have to put a positive attitude and their job, school, home and in the general life and are going to be the things change.\\n\\nsometimes in the life that people need a push and a person with positive attitude can be that push.\\n\\nIf a person dont have positive attitude that person always is going to do everything wrong, because if a person dont believe in herself nobody can do it.. For example: Generic_Name want to be part of the marine she love the Marine, but her parents said is too much difficult is impossible for youa but Generic_Name have positive attitude.\\n\\nThe positive attitude always is going to be the key to success in life, because it is the base of everything all the peoples have to believed, is dosent matter what other people say or do, because in the future the only responsible for the things is going to be you nobody also. In the life that people have to show the better face and smile and say everything is possible,but no only said, that people have to believe that', \"However, it is important to consider that students may not be able to benefit fully from this style of learning.\\n\\nThe main issue is that this environment is full of potential distractions. Students may be easily tempted by electronic devices or the company of their parents, siblings or friends. This can lead to them feeling disengaged with their education, and reluctant to continue to learn.\\n\\nFinally, due to the lack of a physical break in a technician's routine, fatigue can easily impair their concentration and performance. Without the support of their teacher, the individualised guidance needed to fully understand concepts or problems might be lacking. This means that much of their attention is potentially not focused on school work, which can have a detrimental effect on their progress and educational attainment.\\n\\nAnother concern is that some students may find distance learning dull, and struggle to concentrate and learn on their own. Without physical activity, regular breaks and structure, students may feel overwhelmed or exhausted by having to make it through the day, which can lead to issues with maintaining mental and physical health.\\n\\nIn conclusion, despite some advantages, distance learning does not necessarily provide an ideal environment for students who wish to focus on their studies. The potential for multiple distractions, lack of teacher guidance and added stress of regular study on their own, can create difficulties for learners who are looking to excel in their chosen field.. \\nDistance learning may have its advantages for those who are unable to attend physical classes due to challenging family or work commitments\", '\\nConserving energy is one of the most important elements of sustainability and resource conservation. It is important to conserve energy both financially and ecologically — environmentally-friendly energy conservation can lead to economic and environmental benefits, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and saving money on energy bills. By conserving energy, we can reduce our carbon footprint, help protect the environment, and make significant cost savings.. Teachers can encourage students to move away from traditional paper-based learning activities and use digital applications instead. Additionally, conserving energy can help to reduce reliance on natural resources like paper, such as in an academic setting. There are also many ways individuals can help conserve energy in everyday life, such as turning off lights when leaving a room, washing clothes in cold water, buying products with the Energy Star label, and recycling', \"Similarly, extending the school day by two hours could have a number of consequences. \\n\\nDespite the potential advantages of a four-day working week, some organizations may be cautious about the trade-off between time and energy savings. Such a move prevents students from having free-time after school and could lead to an over-scheduling of classes and activities. \\n\\nWhen it comes to education, there is a clear difference between the energy and resources used when attending school five days per week for eight hours and four days per week for the same amount of time. By implementing a four-day work week, organizations are able to dramatically reduce their energy and resource consumption both directly and indirectly. For example, fewer hours working each week means less electricity used, less fuel consumed for commuting, and fewer resources wasted on stationery and utilities. It can also put a strain on resources such as electricity, water, and paper, reducing the school's ability to conserve energy and resources. \\nOne strategy business are increasingly adopting to conserve energy and resources is to decrease the amount of time spent in the office each week. While the total amount of time spent remains the same, most energy-consuming activities such as heating and air-conditioning are required over a longer period when school is spread out over five days. . Additionally, students must use more resources such as fuel to commute back and forth to school five days per week as opposed to four\", 'Famous expressionists such as Claude Monet, Pablo Picasso, and Frida Kahlo have helped to promote the importance of art for generations. It provides an opportunity for students to find classes that are engaging and stimulating for them, which can lead to more involved learning. Throughout history, different types of art classes have emerged, including painting, woodworking, music, drama, and even dance. \\n\\nTaking an elective course provides a much more beneficial experience when compared to a required class. \\n\\nAdditionally, allowing students to choose their own electives gives them a level of autonomy, helping to foster independence and creativity. . This allows them to explore different activities that they may not normally seek out, encouraging them to develop new skills and gain knowledge outside of their traditionally structured courses. Electives allow students to choose classes that offer more interests and learning opportunities that are not necessarily offered in the required classes. Musical instruments such as the harp and the flute can often be found in art classes, as well as popular plays like \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"The Comedy of Errors\". \\nLearning art is a valuable and enriching experience that can be enjoyed by all ages. This is far more beneficial to having a required class, where the content may not be viewed as exciting or engaging by the student, resulting in a lack of interest and in worse case scenarios, failure', 'If a student has already made a poor first impression, they may not even bother to apply for a job or school program because they are convinced that no one would give them a chance. This can lead to insecurities, feelings of inadequacy, and distaste for their own strengths and abilities. \\nFirst impressions can be a powerful force in shaping the way teenagers in high school think of themselves. A single comment or facial expression made by someone they want to impress can have a significant impact on their self-confidence and self-worth. This can create a cycle of doubt and negativity, in which teenagers are unable to escape from their self-imposed mental prison.. It can also cause teenagers to miss out on opportunities that could have otherwise proved beneficial', \"Summer is the time for relaxing. The warm, sunny days help keep the stress down, and it gives freedom to the kids in school. Dlthough, that freedom comes to a small halt when summer projects are assigned. Summer projects are given so the students don't forget what they learned during the year. These assignments are normally teacher designed, but on rare occasions, students will design them too. Summer projects should be teacher designed because it is already preplanned throughout the year, it could mean less work for the students, and it could be easy on the teachers and the students.\\n\\nTeachers that teach the same topic get together sometimes during their planning periods to have a meeting. This meeting lets teachers plan future assignments for their students. These assignments could be homework, notes, tests, and even summer projects. Summer projects are usually planned way in advance, so the teachers can lead up to it at the end of the year when the students know everything. The teachers always want to make sure that the students know everything before they assign the project. Then, once the time comes, the teacher will assign the summer project to the well-prepared students.\\n\\nStudents want to enjoy their freedom from school, and teachers know that. Its more likely for teachers to hand out less work so that the teachers can easily grade them and finish before most of the summer is taken up. Back in elementary school, teachers usually hand out summer reading lists to students to encourage them to read over the summer. This summer reading list usually gave prizes to students who completed the list. Dll they had to do was read the book that was assigned and then give a small summery of what happened. Reading is something many people do naturally when they have free time, or before they go to bed. This assignment doesn't require much work at all, and it gives the students all the time they need to finish, and it can help teachers relax too.\\n\\nSummer is not only for students, but its also for the teachers and faculty too. The teachers would want to plan something easy for the students, so they can come back to school knowledgeable, but also fresh. They want to challenge the student while also letting them enjoy their three-month break from school. Teacher designed projects will more likely lean more on the easy side of things. When teachers plan for the future, they can also plan to have the students learn everything to know before the summer project comes up, and when it arrives, the students will already know how to complete the project within the first few days of the assignment.\\n\\nTeacher designed assignments are great and all, but students know what they want. Ds it may seem, student designed assignments would be better because it gives the student more of a choice on the topic of to do for the project; however, the student may not be prepared enough for their choice of topic. If the students choose to make their own project, then some might not know what to do and then will fail the assignment due to lack of information on how the project works. Teacher designed projects are always planned accordingly to the knowledge of the student and will always be good on the student.\\n\\nIn conclusion, teachers should always make their summer assignments. Teachers know all too well of what the future holds for their given subject. Teachers want to enjoy their summer too, and they want it to last just as long as the students. They want everything to be super easy, so they can get it over with as quick as possible. Summer assignments should be teacher designed because it is already preplanned throughout the year, it could mean less work for the students and teachers, and it could be easy on the teachers and the students for their final assessment.\", \"Most people take that decision when they are teenagers,that is the most hard decision to make because you are living all your past behind and trying to work hard and never go back to the same place.\\n\\nPeople who did take that decision when they where young they know how it feels be on that situation, they learn how to be themself and how a real man act. That is what be yourself mean care about you and your family and give to your little brothes the opportunities that you did not have. What Ralph Emerson say,sometimes it could be a challenge for some adult but it is more then a challenge for teenagers,because since you are a children you know how your life is going to be.\\n\\nIf you grow up in a family who cares about you on what you do the whole day you know that you are lucky because not all people have the same family as you. This world is for the people with strongest feeling weak people don't survive in this world. When the person don't have support from their family they do what they can so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family. At this point this teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did with out their help or end up in jail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       .

We should never underestimate the power of kindness and continue showing it to those around us.. \\n\\nI also experienced this positive effect firsthand. Communities where people take the time to care for those around them can be more welcoming and create a sense of belonging. \\n\\nIn addition, kind deeds can have a positive influence on the community. \\nShowing kindness to others can have a profound impact on our lives and the community. It’s no surprise that the more people commit to random acts of kindness, the more people benefit from it. One instance was when I offered to tutor a classmate who was having difficulty in a course. Even small acts of kindness can make a big difference in people’s lives. Through our tutoring sessions, not only did my classmate’s grades improve, but I also had the chance to build a meaningful connection with them. Growing up, I was surrounded by people who believed that a simple act of kindness could change someone’s day and bring happiness to them. Whether it was lending a helping hand to someone in need or volunteering at a homeless shelter, I saw that being kind to others could make a positive difference', 'Additionally, children are more likely to taste new foods when their peers are trying them as well. On the one hand, it is undeniable that nutrition is important, especially for growing children. \\nChanging the school menu can be a controversial topic, as it has both positive and negative effects. Introducing a more varied and balanced menu would offer students the proper assortment of nutrients needed for a healthy lifestyle. Ultimately, the decision of whether to proceed with changing the school menu must be the result of careful deliberation and research on the topic.. Finally, dining hall staff may need additional training to prepare the food, resulting in additional expenses.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while changing the school menu has the potential to bring multiple benefits to students, it is necessary to consider the potential drawbacks as well. Many students resist change and may be unwilling to try new meals, particularly those which are not part of their culture or personal likes. Furthermore, the cost of introducing higher-quality ingredients may put financial strain on families, especially those whose budgets are already stretched thin. This could help students be more adventurous eaters, resulting in healthier long-term dietary habits.\\n\\nOn the other hand, there is a risk of unfamiliar foods being met with negative responses', 'Furthermore, students may not have enough time and energy to participate in sports teams or practice instruments, which can lead to disinterest in their academic career. \\n\\nIn conclusion, adding an extra one and a half hours of school could have serious detrimental effects on the lives of students, both academically and socially. Furthermore, the strain of the significantly longer day could cause students to become disinterested in school, which could result in higher dropout rates. On top of that, students would be robbed of additional time spent with friends, family, and exploring personal hobbies or leisure activities. \\nTaking an extra one and a half hours per school day would have many pitfalls that students and parents must consider. Therefore, despite the potential benefits of having a longer school day, the drawbacks are simply too great.. The lack of available time for leisure activities, relationships, and sports could result in disinterest in school and a reduced capacity to learn. The lack of available time after school significantly reduces these important opportunities. With such a long school day, students, especially young ones, would be walking home in the dark, which poses serious risks to their safety. \\n\\nIt is essential for students to be able to use their scarce free time to pursue interests, goals, and relationships, that allow them to have life experiences and develop a better understanding of the world', \"Regardless of the type, both techniques are essential when putting together a plan to build self-esteem. Different types of students respond differently to these techniques; for instance, some students respond positively to praise, while others respond better to achievements, such as good grades or awards. Praising helps students feel valued and appreciated, which adds to their sense of self-worth, while achieving helps to motivate and encourage students, giving them a sense of accomplishment. When put together, these tools can be powerful when it comes to boosting a student's self-esteem. In conclusion, praising and achieving are both important parts of building self-esteem, and can be used in combination to help students build confidence and self-worth.. \\nPraising and achieving have both been shown to have positive effects on the self-esteem of students\", '\\n\\nTo continue on my journey of self-reflection and autonomy, I am creating a plan to focus on self-growth and finding what makes me happiest and using that as the foundation for making my own choices. It allows one to better understand themselves and their goals in life, while ensuring that they create goals only for themselves, not for external approval. \\nThroughout my life, I\\'ve worked to find my own personal identity. \\n\\nI have realized that there are moments in my life where I have leaned towards becoming whom others believe I should be, and then moments of proud self-actualization where I realized my own potential and determination to be who I want to be. I\\'ve learned from Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s inspiring words that \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment,\" and I have been reflecting on my own life journey to understand my identity. Being an individual reminds me of the power I have to make my own decisions and I believe that this will help me become a better person than I was previously.. From my experiences in discovering my own identity, I understand now that there can be immense value in finding autonomy and becoming an individual. This plan includes setting achievable goals that place the value of my own opinion and well-being first', '\\nRequiring community service or extra punishment for students who violate school regulations is an important decision that can have a significant impact on the students and the school community. On the one hand, requiring community service can give students an opportunity to learn valuable skills, while also more generally instilling in them a sense of responsibility to their community. On the other hand, extra punishment, such as suspension, can have a strong deterrent effect, sending a message to the rest of the student body that actions have consequences. \\n\\nHaving experienced the effectiveness of both approaches while in school, I believe that, for serious violations, suspension is the more appropriate approach. First, it sends a more serious message that violations will not be tolerated, able to shift the culture of a school in a short amount of time. The experience of suspension itself can also help remind students to take their academics and behaviors more seriously, and the lack of attendance may help students target their studies with greater focus. Ultimately, I think that a combination of both approaches is best; mandatory community service and supplements of harsher punishments when warranted provide a system of checks and balances that can be used to effectively deter students from breaking school regulations.', \"It might see insignificant to debate for something too simple like this,but letting our students take their own choices could help them take better choices for our society. Moreover,if our students are able to graduate and accomplish their goals our society will have more people that could help to assure a better future for our legacy. As a student interested in having an advanced diploma,I believe art classes will not help anybody to achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma,also if students are capable of choosing their own classes they will gain experience in that field,and be more successful.\\n\\nStudents should be able to make their choice when deciding if they are really interested in the class,if someone else choose the class in arts for them and they didn't like it;they could ruin the experience of other students who are really passionate about arts. Moreover,it could lower their GPA and their dream about graduating could be affected.\\n\\nIn addition,art classes will not give them much credit as other classes,will not help grow their GPA,and it might not be as helpful as other classes. A topic that is frequently debated is whether students should be required to take a class in the arts,or should it be elective? Because of both students and parents opinions I believe students should not take a class in the arts,besides it should be an elective.\\n\\nThere are several reasons to consider when debating this topic,for example:the class in arts will require a block that could be used for a class the student is interested in taking,or it could be used for a class the student requires to take in order to achieve graduation. As mentioned before:not passing the class will lower their GPA,even passing it will not give them too much credit,and of course school want students to be successful during their journey through high school.        . Schools should offer our students classes they are willing to attend,a class they feel will help them succeed in life,and in a way they enjoy their journey through high school. The choices they made during school and the classes they took during school will impact when they graduate.\\n\\nAs you have read,giving students the opportunity to choose either they want art classes or to take classes by their own choice could have a big impact in their graduation status. Students who are not interested in art could be a problem for the class and even their grades could be affected if they don't participate,or turn in assignments\", 'Limiting car usage have advantages. For example, being tense can happen having a car but if you do not have a car then your much happier that way just like Heidrun Walter stated in the story. They use smart planning. In suburbans life not having a car is more compact, more accessible to public transportation. Meaning people would not spend more money for gas or anything they will have more money staying in their wallets instead of leaving. They would not car about car insurance or anything because they do not have a car. Also, suburbans are in a new approach of this because now there are stores a walk away.\\n\\nAlso, limiting car usage means less pollution. No more car emissions would be trapped from those cold nights and warm days. There would not be smog also. Cars are stressful and rather than a car use a two-seated bike. Lots of new things can be made in a city rather than cars which are so much distractions.    ', \"Phones have become the common distraction as of today. Everywhere you turn, there are phones in every hand either talking or texting even as people are driving. No one should be allowed to drive and be on their phone at the same time. People should be focusing on the road and not their phone because it's dangerous for other drivers on the road and themselves. There are many accidents that happen just because someone isn't paying attention to the road.\\n\\nPhones shouldn't be allowed on the road as someone is driving because it can be dangerous for people that walk and can cause uncertain deaths.\\n\\nMany people walk to their destinations to meet friends or to even go to work if it's close. They should be able to cross the road without having to worry about a car plowing them down. If someone is driving and they're focusing on their phone, they wouldn't be able to see the person walking across the street. A phone shouldn't have that much of a hold over you. A lot of deaths happen just from people not diverting all of their attention to the road. They're too busy typing on their phones, trying to send a message that could have waited until they reached where they were going. Another life gone down the drain all because a driver paid more attention to their phone than the road.\\n\\nDrivers are distracted while they're on the phone meaning they aren't paying any mind to the cars behind or in front of them. Accidents can happen anywhere at any time of the day. There are so many car crashes that happen on the highways and most of the time, it is because the driver was on their phone. People can get injured or worse, they can die from the sudden impact of the crash. Therefore, drivers should keep their eyes and mind on the road to prevent the death of injury of someone else.\\n\\nPhones are the biggest distraction to drivers as of today and they should be banned from use when driving. People believe that there are more drunk driving deaths than there are driving and texting deaths. Eventually, a law will have to be made to prevent driving while on you are on your phone. In other words, no one should use their phones while they're driving because of the horrible damage it could do to someone else.   \", \"Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.\\n\\nLastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. 75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. . Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.\\n\\nI believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.\\n\\nSecondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.\\n\\nFirst, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time\", 'It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made.                                   . It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.\\n\\nOverall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.\\n\\nSecond reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.\\n\\nOverall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. At times we take advantage way too much. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. When you do not even use it half of the time. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.\\n\\nThere is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours', 'For instance, teachers should check for phones during examinations and, if applicable, confiscate them from students who use them inappropriately. This will allow them to stay connected to the outside world and provide an easy means of communication if necessary. First, teachers should be allowed to carry their cell phones on-campus during school hours. If students are seen using cell phones for any other activity, they should be subject to disciplinary action. As a result, it is proposed that the current policy on cell phone use in the school be revised to provide a more balanced approach for both teachers and students. \\n\\nFinally, stricter enforcement of the policy should be in place. \\n\\nSecond, students should be allowed to use their phones for educational purposes only, such as using online dictionaries and conducting research. \\n\\nTo achieve this, a few changes should be implemented. While this policy is intended to ensure teachers and students can focus on their learning, it has proven to be somewhat ineffective. Lastly, the school should provide information to both teachers and students regarding the revised policy, so everyone is aware of what is expected of them\\n\\nBy introducing these changes, the current policy on cell phone use in the school can be revised to make it fair and effective for both teachers and students.. \\nCurrently, there is a policy in place to restrict the use of cell phones during school hours', 'It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, do AOU agree or disagree? In MA experience, I would highly disagree with this statement. When first meeting somebody, AOU don\\'t always get the right thoughts about that specific person. Once knowing somebody personally Four thoughts start changing, Four mind starts messing up on thinking \"What should I think about this person?\". Due to MA experience I always have luck to MA first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask MA friends what were there thoughts of me when Thea met me for the Vera first time and all of MA friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not Vera kind. After, Thea\\'re opinions later changed once Thea got to me personally, knowing MA personality and knowing how kind I am. MA friends were Vera surprised.\\n\\nSecond, I would insist of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First impressions always depend on the person on how they are feeling or just based of anything that can be said.\\n\\nSecond impressions always get better once Thea seen each other at least ones.\\n\\nThird,\\n\\nI would like to speak on MA experiences with this statement on WHA I disagree with this reasoning. When I was a couple Years Younger I had some Vera means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of Vera mean people. Due to those savings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. People thought Thea already know me through thick and thin but in reality Thea really didn\\'t. Once, I wanted to meet new people Thea never actually really wanted to speak to me or actually meet me because Thea already had there first impression because of the savings. Later on, Years started passing BA and a few people started meeting me more and started speaking to me and once Thea did Thea noticed that I was Vera different person then what people would SAA about me.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, In MA experience I would highly think in MA beliefs I would defended not based MA first impression on somebody I\\'m just meeting. I like to get treated on how I treat others. First impressions are never good that\\'s WHA it\\'s never good to get based off that. You\\'ve read MA about MA past and now know WHA I don\\'t go off that. If AOU ever decided to go off first impressions and not change Four mind about Four first impression then good luck to AOU.', 'for example: first it benefits them to start at the age to have in mind what are some types of career the student want for his or her future after graduated high school. to study in the future and sucess on college to have a better life for her or his family in the future, thats why is great idea to start at the age to pick the career they want to do on future.. Do you wonder is a great idea to choose a career at a young age?\\n\\nIn my position is a exellent idea to choose career at a young age, Because in some socities, student are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. when you enter to high shool your counselor would guide you which diploma the student want to have and which career for the future. third when you are in high school they give the student basic classes that you need to pass for 9 grade and 10 grade to persuade faster and easier , to have some experiencies and knowleged on what are your goals and be prepared on the others two years,\\n\\nif you like the same career you pick when you enter high school or you want to change your mind on a diffrent type career want to do, teachers and counselor are a great full help for student to succes to guide the student what are some great benefits the career the students pick to study to give him the amount of money to lived and work with the career and be succesful in the future when the student finished the high school. Finally for 11 grade and 12 grade they give the student some diffult classes to pass to graduated from high school , 11 grade is more diffult to pass, Beacuse it requires 2 classes to graduated pass for to get 12 grade the student only come for the classes the counselor give student to be prepared for what diploma the student choose , if his the advance diploma or standard diploma for his or her carrer the student choose to graudated.\\n\\nfor my conclusion is a wonderful way to start in a young age , To start thiking what would you want for your future if this is a great career to pick and whats benefits give you for your future, in high school they prepared you for what the student planing to do when he or her graduated from high school , if his going to college to have a better life or go nova to be prepared on what you like to do in the future, You hvae some knowleges of what carrer you would succes in the future and start thiking this is what you like for your carrer and make it real the dream what you want to become in the future.\\n\\nthere many career you can choose to become someone in life , this is way i think they should start at the young age when they enter to high school teacher and counselor would do the best to make the student to choose one career studen is interested on. Second thing it would persuade them which type of diploma they would like to have if the advances diploma or the standard diploma, the advance diploma it requires to have 9 sol pass and all the classes and for the for standard it requires 6 sol and all the clases. their are many courses of classes are selected to guide them toward to choose a speficic carrer', 'Working alone has the advantage of allowing an individual to work at their own pace and without having to answer to or coordinate with other people. Working with a group also allows an opportunity to brainstorm, divide tasks, and have built-in accountability partners. Depending on the individual or the nature of the task, one method may be more advantageous than the other. Additionally, research has shown that people who are typically given more autonomy and decision-making power over their own work tend to perform better and have more productive results. However, the most successful teams often combine both methods to capitalize on the strengths of both.. Furthermore, research conducted by Harvard Business Review found that companies that promote collaboration within their teams achieved higher success and out-performed other organizations who relied primarily on individual work. \\nAfter careful consideration of the topic, it is clear that there are valid benefits to both working alone and working with a group. Similarly, working with a group also has its advantages, as it offers the opportunity to work collaboratively with others to achieve a common goal. \\n\\nIn conclusion, both working alone and working in a group offer unique advantages', \"With enough preparation, the team can then compete in championships for the honor of winning trophies. To continue achieving success, the players must continually practice various drills, such as passing, shooting, and ball control, to hone their individual soccer skills. \\nMexico's soccer team is one of the most formidable contenders in international tournament play. The ultimate goal for the team is to qualify for the World Cup championship and play in leagues in order to become eligible for more prestigious trophies.. With a current tactical approach that combines team spirit and defensive prowess, the team has achieved great success in recent years. Friendly games can be a valuable asset to improve the skills and strategies of the team, and when combined with rigorous practice, can lead to a successful competitive season. Furthermore, the team must practice and perfect different team formations and strategies in order to effectively use their talents in tournament play\", '\\n\\nA prominent argument for adding one and a half hours to the school day is that it could provide students with more diverse learning opportunities. Teachers may become overburdened with increased class sizes or with the need to plan additional courses. On the other hand, students may become overwhelmed with increased workload and lengthened days could increase stress levels. Students may also struggle to keep up with more demanding academic requirements, resulting in a decline in concentration and motivation.\\n\\nUltimately, before extending the school day, it is important to consider the impact that it will have on students and teachers. \\n\\nHigher education experts have debated the potential benefits and drawbacks of extending school days for decades. Students may also benefit from having more time to build relationships with peers in a supervised environment.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the impact of adding one and a half hours to the school day could be varied and unpredictable. This could include additional courses, clubs, arts education, and tutoring. Adding one and a half hours to the school day could provide students with more time to complete courses and allow teachers to cover more material. Careful research and planning should be conducted to ensure that any potential benefits outweigh the drawbacks.', \"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to express my opinion on the debate around the Electoral College system versus a popular vote for electing the President of the United States. Both sides present reasonable arguments, and there are merits to considering alternatives. However, after careful consideration of the information provided, I believe the Electoral College currently serves our democratic process well and should be retained for now.\\n\\nThose advocating for a popular vote claim it would make every citizen's vote truly equal and democracy more direct. It does seem undemocratic that someone can win the national popular vote but lose the election due to the current system. However, others argue this could disadvantage some states and potentially cause candidates to ignore smaller states during campaigns. The texts note that candidates may focus only on populous areas, diminishing the influence of rural states. A popular vote could undermine the federal nature of how we elect the President. \\n\\nSupporters of retaining the Electoral College counter that it promotes Greater Geographical representation and encourages nationwide campaigning. Candidates still must build broader coalitions of diverse interests rather than just major population centers. It also keeps the process of elections administratively clearer on a statebystate basis rather than a complex national tally. While the electoral results don't always match the popular vote, supporters argue this was the system agreed upon and both major candidates base their strategies around receiving electoral votes.\\n\\nBoth sides offer persuasive considerations. A wholesale change to the system could have unforeseen impacts and weaken the representation of less populated states. However, reforms may be worth exploring to address concerns about electoral disagreements with the national popular vote. Overall, Riven the stability the Electoral College has provided and its role in maintaining our federal structure, I believe it remains the best system for now and should be kept in place\", 'Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation.\\n\\nAnother reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress.\\n\\nOverall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students.\\n\\nEducators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people. . Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer.\\n\\nFinally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. I do not think this is a good idea. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there', \"Would you like to graduate? if so you should. You can also go to university and get your bachelor degree if you really want to but first you need to get your high school diploma and graduate from anything in college.\\n\\nAfter all of that you can do any career you want because you graduated from mostly everything and thats why its important to graduate. I would like to graduate because its' important to me and you need to be graduated to work in certain jobs. Then i would be actually be proud of my self that i graduated from school and saw that i finished school and yes it is important to graduate because its a important thing that you have done in your life.\\n\\nAlso you can get any jobs you like if you graduate and take education and finish school. And there is more reasons why you should graduate but those are the mains ones for me its like my own Opinion i dont know about what other's think about you just need to take education in order to have a good career or get a good job if you want.\\n\\nAlso graduateing can show you that you learned new subjects and you passed them and you feel great about your self when you do those new things.. Here are the reasons why you should its a great thing to graduate out of school because you can be done with school you can join any educational if you want and you would be proud of your self.\\n\\nAlso you need to pass most of your class's in order to graduate for high school or anything like that\", 'For instance, mobile phones can help teachers easily manage class assignments, store student grades, and create collaborative learning opportunities. \\n\\nSome major arguments against having students use their phones in the classroom are that mobile phones can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on academic tasks, impede students’ ability to engage with course material, and reduce students’ respect for their instructors. \\n\\nThe use of mobile phones in classrooms for educational purposes is a topic that has received much attention in recent years. Research has shown that the mere presence of mobile phones in the classroom can create an atmosphere of distraction, and divert attention away from course material. Furthermore, having confidential student information accessible on phones can reduce student-teacher trust and engagement in the learning process. \\n\\nIn conclusion, allowing phones in the classroom can have a negative impact on student learning. On the one hand, proponents of the use of phones in educational settings believe that they can help facilitate learning. This can lead to decreased grades, poor test performance, and a decrease in student-teacher interaction. Mobile phones can be a source of distraction, impede the ability to engage in academic tasks, and diminish respect from student to teacher. On the other hand, opponents of phones in classrooms contend that they can negatively affect student learning by becoming a distraction and monitor students’ academic performance. While phones can be used in educational settings to create collaboration opportunities, it is important to provide students with guidelines and regulations about the use of phones in the classroom in order to ensure that phones do not become a hindrance to student learning.', \"Phones AUE equipped by everyone in today's society. Whether you AUE poor of rich of even in between, getting a phone seems to be the easiest thing to get you hands on. Humans use phones to keep in contact originally, but now it's used for entertainment, and nowadays, you can make a lot of money off of you cellular device. However people tend to use phones moue often than they should now since there have been moue social apps, texting etc. equipped on devices. One big issue in the overuse of phones is using them while operating a vehicle. This particularly is a big issue because people have gotten hit, and many accidents have been the result of using phones while in the CAU. Each year over 421,000 accidents happen every year due to texting and driving of the drive was distracted by something else on that phone as well. Driving while using you phone can be very detrimental to you life and someone else's.\\n\\nDriving is risky every time you do it, there AUE a lot of bad drivers out there just as much as there AUE good drivers out there, so it is always important to be focused while you'UE on the road. Using a phone can be dangerous firstly because you can harm yourself of someone else as an result of not being aware while you'UE driving. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in 2017 there were 34,439 clashes and 9% of the clashes involved a distracted drive and 486 fatalities were as an result of these clashes with a cell phone in use. Also, reports from the National Safety Council also say that if you AUE on you phone while you'UE driving then you AUE 6 times moue likely to get into an accident then a drunk drive. These situations can affect both you and somebody else if you hit another CAU of just somebody crossing the street.\\n\\nNobody wants to go to court of be present in a court of law, especially for something like being on you phone while driving. Being on you phone while driving is a moving traffic violation and may go down as a criminal misdemeanor. Also depending on what state you'UE in you can pay fines for being on you phone while driving. For example in Georgia you pay $150 for being on you phone while driving but in other states such as California with the smallest fee you'd have to pay with only $20, however in Alaska with the highest fee you'd have to pay up to $10,000, and you'd have to do a year in prison as well. This can also go on you second if the state you live in has phone use while driving as a Moving traffic Violation. For this to be the repercussions of using you phone while driving, I'm telling you it's not south it.\\n\\nFinally, Texting and Driving can also lead you to Prison. In the previous paragraphs I spoke on the fines and fatality statistics. In Alaska, you can pay an additional $10,000 with a year in prison included and there were 486 fatalities in 2017 alone. Whether you texting of on social media while driving these distractions can end up hunting someone else moue then you and this can lead you to the penitentiary even if it was an accident. In 2015 nearly 4,000 deaths accused due to distracted drivers another 3,450 were in the year 2016. This is a serious crime and people who have hit and killed people because they were distracted drivers can face up to 20 years in prison due to casualties from them being distracted. To play it safe the phone shouldn't be used while driving so no one gets hunt.\\n\\nIn Conclusion, being on you phone while driving is very dangerous for both you and people around you. This can be very detrimental to you second, and you could be changed huge fines depending on where you live, you'UE not going to see many people in Alaska doing this. These accidents and casualties AUE preventable if drivers have the self control to only use that phones when there not driving that CAU. However maybe another way to fix it is if everyone had to pay the $10,000 like in Alaska, that may seem like a lot but someone looses that life is south way moue.  \", 'is the quote you have to keep on mind when you fail the first time and the the second time you got it right. maybe you might lost people during that battle but when you know the meaning of the quote and you understand it you are going to know that everything was for a purpose in life and after all you when through you success a lot in your life.

On one hand, schools should be able to have somerestriction in the activities students participate in in order to ensure their students are safe and they can practice proper supervision. Overall, it should be the students who have the final say on the extracurricular activities they choose to participate in, as it may be integral to their development.. However, there is an ongoing debate about whether schools should be in control of which activities their students take part in. On the other hand, students should be the ones ultimately in control of what activities they take part in, as such activities can be an important source of personal growth and development. It is important for students to be able to make informed decisions about the activities they engage in, as those activities ultimately have an impact on their future', 'When working alone, one has more time to gain insight and understanding as there is no need to engage with others, allowing you to focus on the goal. Furthermore, when working alone, there is no need to compromise in order to accommodate opinions of others. \\nWorking alone has many benefits that may be overlooked when compared to working in a group. Finally, working alone helps increase confidence as you are solely responsible for the outcome of the project and can measure your own capabilities.\\n\\nWhen we consider the advantages of working alone, it is clear that it can provide great value when it comes to developing knowledge and understanding, as well as leading to success.. Moreover, there is no need to share ideas or credit, as all ownership remains solely yours. Success outcomes are more likely to be achieved when working alone as there is no getting caught up in unnecessary arguments or delayed decision making. This freedom allows you to push your boundaries and be creative as you see fit. For starters, working alone can help to echo back and refresh knowledge by teaching yourself through your own projects', \"Furthermore, shortening the summer break would make it difficult for students to break from their habits, explore new interests, and gain the perspective and balance they need to be successful. We must recognize the value of summer break for students and oppose any efforts to reduce it significantly.. \\nSummer break is an important time for students to recharge and refocus after a busy school year. It gives them a much needed respite from academic pressures, a precious chance to relax, and the opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests that are not always available during the rest of the year. Taking away the summer break could also put students' mental health at risk. For those juggling multiple responsibilities, such as jobs, summer break is a vital opportunity to catch up on rest, spend time with family, and plan for the upcoming school year. With no break, they may become burned out and overwhelmed trying to manage both their academic and personal lives\", \"kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired.                         . some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week?\\n\\npeople have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school.\\n\\nFinally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid.\\n\\nFirst, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both.\\n\\nSecond, everyone's brain needs to a break. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school.\\n\\nIn conclusion, as you have read. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyone's brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid\", 'The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. They will know what kind of project to create. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. If they need it because they can loose their job.\\n\\nLets say if the students decide to design the project there own. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.. Students and teachers have important roles in their life. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.\\n\\nAt the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.\\n\\nHaving the teacher design the project is way smarter. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job', 'The extra two hours per day would also allow teachers to dig deeper into their subjects and help students stay engaged and focused. While this idea has drawn both support and criticism, there are many valid arguments in favor of the four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day. Furthermore, a four-day school week would provide an economic benefit, as schools would need fewer personnel to clean and maintain the buildings. Plus, this would give families a bit of a break when it comes to childcare responsibilities, as they could use those days to plan activities, run errands, or simply get some much-needed rest. \\nAs the debate over school schedules continues to be an ongoing issue, an innovative idea has been proposed: reduce the number of school days from five to four, and increase the length of each day to two extra hours. In short, moving to a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day represents an innovative way of ensuring students receive a quality education while reducing stress and providing a cost-effective solution for schools.. \\n\\nUltimately, a four-day school week with two extra hours of school each day would be beneficial for everyone involved. \\n\\nFirst, a four-day school week would reduce stress by allowing students, teachers and staff more time to socialize, participate in extra-curricular activities, or pursue hobbies. Additionally, the cost savings for schools would be a welcome bonus. Students would have fewer days to feel anxious and overwhelmed, while still having the opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the subjects they are studying', 'Some people rather be individuality because they didn\\'t like the opinion of others.\\n\\nTo begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves.

In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. People do not need be with a partner to demonstrate that they can do many things for themselves.. For example, \"those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves.\" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them.\\n\\nsecondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves.

Being individuality people became to learn many things. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone.\\n\\nIn the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. However, that is not true because be individual make\\'s people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others\\' believe for us', 'These renowned individuals triumphed over obstacles in both physical and intellectual endeavors, paving the way for ground-breaking discoveries in the fields of science, philosophy, and the arts. For instance, teachers and mentors can help their students cultivate inquisitiveness and be courageous in tackling new challenges. To ensure this, proper research should be conducted before any discovery is put to use, and the consequences must be studied to ensure that they are beneficial to society.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci are prime examples of individuals who rose above their circumstances and pushed themselves to explore new ideas and create lasting change. It is necessary to provide the right combinations of motivation and support to encourage people to think beyond conventional boundaries and make new discoveries. In addition, these discoveries must be made responsibly, with the proper research and precautions being taken to ensure that the changes are in the best interest of society.. What made them stand out was their ability to think outside the box and push themselves to explore unexplored areas. \\nThe accomplishments of Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci have had an immense impact on society, leaving an indelible mark on our history and culture. Furthermore, knowledge sharing and collaboration also plays an essential role, as it creates an environment wherein the exchange of ideas can result in amazing discoveries.\\n\\nFinally, while new discoveries can have positive effects on society, they can also have unintended consequences. The right environment can motivate individuals to think beyond conventional methods and put their creative skills to use. For instance, Newton developed his groundbreaking laws of motion, while Shakespeare wrote some of the most renowned works of literature in history.\\n\\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor that led to their success, it is clear that in order for people to flourish intellectually, they must be provided the right combination of stimulation and encouragement.

On the positive side, having a curfew can help to ensure that teens are safe and in a secure environment at night, restricting the potential to engage in risky behaviors such as drinking, drug use, or being on the streets with potential predators. Imposing a curfew could also undermine parent-child relationships, leading to an increased feeling of mistrust on both sides. Furthermore, a curfew rule could be difficult to enforce, as police officers would have to take time away from more important duties such as patrolling the streets and responding to emergencies. Although there may be some potential benefit to this policy, it is important to consider the potential downsides and determine if the pros outweigh the cons.. Additionally, a curfew could encourage more responsible spending on the part of teens by forcing them to stay home and increasing the amount of time spent on studying, sleeping, and engaging in other positive, healthy activities. For instance, it could stifle creativity and socializing amongst teens, as they may feel more confined and restricted to their homes. \\n\\nUltimately, it is important to evaluate both the pros and cons of implementing a curfew rule for teens before making a decision. \\n\\nOn the other hand, enforcing a curfew could have some drawbacks\", \"While the idea of cars driving themselves may seem exciting, the current limitations and potential drawbacks of this technology outweigh its benefits.\\n\\nFirstly, the current technology of driverless cars is not yet capable of handling complex driving scenarios at higher speeds. They are only reliable for simple functions at speeds up to 25 mph, and beyond that, the technology falters. This raises questions about the practicality of these cars, as they still require human intervention and constant vigilance. As the author of the article notes, if a driver still needs to be actively engaged, are these cars truly driverless?\\n\\nFurthermore, the installation of cameras to monitor drivers raises significant privacy concerns. The thought of being constantly watched and evaluated by a manufacturer is unsettling, and could lead to increased stress and distracted driving. Traditional cars, without such surveillance, have generally performed well, which questions the necessity of this feature in driverless cars.\\n\\nAdditionally, the economic implications of transitioning to driverless cars are substantial. The vehicles require compatible infrastructure, such as 'smart roads' that can communicate with them, which would be exorbitantly expensive. The logistics and financial burden of such a transition are daunting, and it's unclear who would bear these costs.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while driverless cars represent a remarkable technological advancement, their current form leaves much to be desired. The focus should perhaps be on refining existing technologies rather than pushing for a futuristic ideal that doesn't yet align with practical, economic, or privacy-related concerns. Therefore, I argue against the development of driverless cars, and instead advocate for the improvement of traditional cars, which have proven to be effective and less invasive.\", 'Deal State Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to excess my support FOC abolishing the Electoral College AFD electing the President of the United States by popular vote.\\n\\nThe Electoral College is AF outdated system that does For effect the wive of the people.

For years, people believed this formation was created by intelligent extraterrestrial life. However, NASA has since debunked this theory by providing evidence that the face is a natural landform.\\n\\nTo begin with, the article highlights that the face-like formation was captured by NASA\\'s Viking 1 spacecraft in 1976. Initially, people believed that this formation was an unusual rock formation. Still, conspiracy theories soon emerged that the face was a sign of extraterrestrial life on Mars. However, in 1997, NASA\\'s Mars Global Surveyor captured new images of Cydonia, revealing that the formation was a natural landform. The images were similar to Earth\\'s buttes or mesa, and laser altimetry confirmed the formation was of natural origins.\\n\\nThe article also points out that the face-like formation\\'s geological interest lies in its location at the potential ancient Martian ocean boundary. This suggests that the formation could have been created by natural geological processes, such as erosion, rather than extraterrestrial life. Moreover, the article notes that the face-like formation is one of many mesas in Cydonia, indicating that it is not unique and could have formed naturally.\\n\\nIt is essential to recognize that the article\\'s scientific evidence supports the claim that the face-like formation is a natural landform. The Mars Global Surveyor\\'s images, laser altimetry, and the geological location of the formation all indicate that this is a natural occurrence. The article also highlights that NASA prioritized photographing Cydonia to dispel conspiracy theories and provide evidence that the face-like formation is not a sign of extraterrestrial life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the article \"Unmasking the Face on Mars\" provides compelling evidence that the face-like formation in Cydonia is a natural landform. The Mars Global Surveyor\\'s images, laser altimetry, and geological location all support this claim. It is essential to recognize that the formation is one of many mesas in Cydonia, indicating that it is not unique and could have formed naturally. While conspiracy theories surrounding the face-like formation may continue, it is crucial to rely on scientific evidence and data to understand the truth.', 'As seen in paragraph 2 it says how Venus is the closest planet to earth in terms of density and size, but it also says that there were attempts to launch unmanned aircraft onto the planet and none of them lasted a few hours which is why there hasn\\'t been an aircraft actually to land on Venus. Paragraph 2 shows a little taste of how dangerous Venus is, but it is enticing to learn more about the planet itself. Hn paragraph 3 it explains how Venus\\'s atmosphere is almost 97 percent carbon dioxide, and the clouds are highly corrosive with temperatures reaching more than 800 degrees Fahrenheit. These are even more reasons on why it is dangerous but yet you would want to know more about it.\\n\\nThe reason why scientists want to know more about the planet even though it is dangerous is because in paragraph 4 it says That \"Astronomers are fascinated by Venus because it may well once have been the most Earthlike planet in our solar system.\" Which is another reason why scientists want to know more about Venus and what it has in store. The planet seems to be a very cool place to live without all the setbacks with the atmosphere and the corrosive clouds. The scientists of NASA have an idea on how to send a manned vehicle to Venus without getting into all the dangerous areas by putting a blimp like air vehicle hovering 30 miles above all the bad and dangerous chemicals and heat.\\n\\nThe reason it would be a very good thing to study on is because of it being similar to earth in many ways. One reason why is said in paragraph 8 in which it states\" Striving to meet the challenge presented by Venus has value, not only because of the insight to be gained on the planet itself, but also because human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\" Which I do agree on this being a good cause because not only do we get knowledge, but we get more into it which is a dangerous route, but it is for the good of man and how not only will we be able to put man on Venus one day but to be able to further our own civilization. Another dangerous part about the exploration is that we go back to the part where it says no aircraft has ever been able to withstand only a few hours of the planets\\' atmosphere, but as it says in paragraph 7 they are making a vehicle that can survey and gain knowledge on the planet instead of sending a vehicle on the planet. Scientists will be able to gain the knowledge on how to produce a product for NASA that can both withstand the harsh heat and atmosphere, but move on the planet like a rover.', 'By continuing to strive for our goals, we are able to gain the experience, confidence, and resilience needed to persevere through the difficulties associated with failure.\\n\\nUltimately, the journey to success is one of continual growth, learning, and self-discovery; and sometimes our biggest successes come from moments of failure. \\nFailure is an inevitable part of life, and it can be an integral component of success.

He should let them use it during lunch periods and other free time. There the ones that are having there lunch. Either walk around talk or what ever they like to do or use there phones. They should know when to use the phones.\\n\\nStudents should be able to use there phones during there free time. It is there free time and they should know what there going to do with it. Use there phones during there free time.\\n\\nThe principal should also let the students use there phones during there lunch periods. So that's why you should let students use there phones when there not learning. The principal should allow students to bring cell phones to school. If there not learning there just having fun. I think the students are old and responsible. There not learning there just having fun with there friends and eating. That's why the principal should let the students. They are old and responsible to let them use there phones. So there is no reason to not let students use there phones. During there lunch time they should know if there going to eat or not. During there free time or lunch time. As long as they turn them of during class time or any other learning time. Use there phones during there lunch period.\\n\\nSo why not let the students use there phones. To let them use there phones during lunch or any other free time. You should really let them use there phones during there time.\\n\\nThe End      . They are old already and they what there doing.

This story make me think about it if i have the election to choose how i can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school.\\n\\nI think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home that\\'s great idea. He will try to find the way to solve the problem by himself.\\n\\nAlso if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. If they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is more better for their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home. So what my friend do? during her pregnancy she still coming to the school i saw her many time she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby yet she take in her house the next classes i was surprise about it either i do not how unconfortable it was for her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school but she didn\\'t feel ok for leave her baby at home. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still going at school, but it was diffult for them had to continue study and also after that they giving birth too. Attend classes from home by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day don\\'t and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary \"NEVER GIVE UP\" when we want something that we can\\'t get it in nowhere only in our effort we can make that possible. Yes i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus.\\n\\n-The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, \" the intelligent student told me that i can\\'t do anything or i can\\'t speak very well English\" still if we want make our goals we can do it. Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are:\\n\\n- Spend more time in the computer\\n\\n- More focus in the homework\\n\\n- Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want\\n\\n- Study all the day\\n\\n- No talk with your friends during your class\\n\\n- Finish more fast with no distraction\\n\\nAll that things are benfit if the students being to attend classes in their home in the winter they don\\'t have to worry about how cold is outside in the morning or what clothes is appropriate for school, and have to coming in the school in a good mood for study and see somebody that we do not want to see and prevent be involve in problems with another student. but there are many problems; what happen if the student do not have money to pay the online classes? either their families do not have the recourses for help them another reason that\\'s why we have to work and make money for us and we missing many days in the school for stay at home because we want sleep more hours or we coming to the school and we are no pay attention what the teacher is talk about the class, So i think this if a student want money need to work and continue study online maybe in that way is more easy pass the class and the SOL. Without go to the school.\\n\\n-For example:\\n\\nIf a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study.                . i know that because a friend told me and another girls too, she told us the process that she has to pass during her pregnancy and after when she has her baby with her I don\\'t know how hard it is, but i can imagine in this position. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting.\\n\\nEventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. Below for those students that don\\'t like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. Could fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it.\\n\\nDuring school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials', '    . Yes, they might be real and make you feel butterfly 5 months or 6,but things changes in this life person change not everything is always the same,anyways he started to lie to me when i knew that truth of that problems is when he start to hurt me all the time but when you love someone you let them hurt you,so i keep letting him hurt me,i started crying and to supplicated to stop hurting me he stop like any relationship we were okay for a week and then he started doing things that hurt,he started talking to girls,and cheated on me but us girls we so dumb that we keep them.2 Years after i was in depression i did not tell my parents they found out when they take me to the hospital because i passed out in my room crying, without eating for days i was in the hospital for a week after that i was able to go they take me to therapy. Girls,let me tell you my big mistake that i did,we talk about 5 months as a friend after we talk for 5 months he make me his girlfriend,at the time i was still feeling butterfly for him that first years is was perfect like any relationship,those 12 months i was so happy,i always told him that he was \\'\\'the love of my life\\'\\' and i just say it for everything we went trough since middle school also,because he was my first boyfriend and my parents were fine that i was dating him because they though he was a good person.\\n\\nGirls,find a guy who is real with you all the time they might be a lot of guys out there that can pretend that he is in love with you.

One day i told him that i want him to be honest with me,he always said that he was honest with me,2 week pass by he were keeping playing his little games and i did not say anything i just leave his message in delivered,1 years pass by he texted me saying that he felt so bad for everything he did to me in the past,i just told him everything that i felt for him in the past but he was not honest with me. i\\'m not thinking to go out with a guy because girls you have to love yourself to be able to love other person.\\n\\nIn conclusion,if you are honest with yourself your life will be okay without any problem. after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was \"i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i\\'ts me\" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i\\'m not going to lie like i\\'m afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me. When i was in 8th grade i met this person i was so in love with him,he add me on snapchat so that same day that he add me i post a pictures that i was in the field,35 minutes after he text me i was so happy,and nervous because i liked him so we start texting but we never talked in person,a week pass by and he start to being disrespectful with me,playing with my feelings i knew that we were just friends in those time. Let\\'s be honest if you\\'re yourself and not faking who you are in this world you\\'ll become a better person in this world', 'Learn something from more then one person because they help you dont get in trouble and be a good student or son if you learn from someone us.\\n\\nLearning advice from school is good because everyone learns and get good grades. Thats why everyone should said a advice for we could be safe and be good.. When teacher shows advice of our class work how to do it and know when test are coming for be ready. When friends gave us advice inside school is because they want a better life for us. For example if you go work with your dad he gave you advice. Learning the right thing helps us to make our life better. If the bus driver does not gave advice everyone in the bus will act crazy and maybe a accident. When we play sports the coach always have advice do win the game. When we get in trouble is bad and you always have to listen when they gave us advice for you do well at your test. Also the bus driver gave us advice how to act inside the bus. When are parents gave us advice we are able to learn do the right thing. Also when they gave us advice like when we play sports. Do something good for school is good because when they gave you advice to do the right thing is class. The person who do not gave a advice of what they doing they will get in trouble if good for our body or not good.\\n\\nWhen we are in math class the students gave us advice same with the teacher. For example the gym teacher gave you advice to do the right not the bad advice because if you do the bad thing you will get a bad grade and get in trouble. When coaches gave us advice to play good and win games that teams will be come so good if the players get the advice of the coach.\\n\\nWhen people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. If we dont get a advice like for something maybe will be bad for us to eat or do and may have problems. When we do well in our test is because the teacher was having us advice and we were paying attecion.\\n\\nFriends gave us advice out side of school and inside school. Also they gave us advice we learn how to do the right thing. When friends gave us advice for our life is because they want us to be happy and be a better person.

If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. Now you will be growing up, and people will appreciate you everywhere you go to. If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. Don't give up, because one day you will realize your dream. You will grow in a good situation, if you are always doing good things and you never do something wrong. In life, you suppose to have done the right things to continue with the others.. You could have done something that you had to do. People who does not have patient cannot make an experience without helping from someone else, and a project is not hard to make, but you have to think about what you are going to say in the project.\\n\\nThere are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. Sometime you have to force yourselfe to work, and in life you need to keep moving on, in what you're doing, you have to make sure that you never go back in the past, because you would like to realize your dream that you promised yourself in the future.\\n\\nFor this position you may say that if you are trying to do something, and you already know that it is not going to be right, just leave it until you find the right way to do it\", \"For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Had the technology a negative or positive effects on people's lives? People are having a negative effects with the technology, I think people can't control it. Furthermore parents have to a limitation on their kids and put a limit on them.. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager can't complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Wedsides are not save you have to have a limitation and also take care of the like. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet.\\n\\nHowever, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things.\\n\\nThat why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.\\n\\nTechnology does not aloww people to complete task with out haave a contact with others. We can do alot of things with out it. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people.\\n\\nTo continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person.\\n\\nIn addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous\", 'Wouldn\\'tA IA be remarkable if in AHE future, computers could read you facial expression and All exactly how you feel?

', \"For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday.\\n\\nOthers would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again.\\n\\nIn conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.\\n\\nEveryone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.\\n\\nHaving a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates.           \", 'When people work together, it can be an incredibly powerful source of creativity, talent, and collaboration that can drive a project towards successful completion.. Moreover, conflicts may arise and disagreements may delay progress. \\n\\nIn conclusion, although there are some negatives to working in a group, the advantages generally outweigh the drawbacks. Additionally, the benefits of having access to different perspectives can significantly improve the accuracy of a project. While it can be tempting to go it alone on a project, expertise and efficiency are much better achieved when working with a team. For example, collaborating with others makes it easier to divide the work and to complete tasks faster. \\nWorking in a group comes with clear advantages over working alone. Finally, interpersonal dynamics that are out of sync can lead to tension in the office. Having a variety of opinions also helps ensure effective problem-solving. Teammates may not always agree on how to proceed or handle tough decisions. \\n\\nHowever, there are some potential drawbacks to working in a group', 'When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was she\\'s very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you\\'ve never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him \"Wow baby, you\\'re so sexy\", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn\\'t want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don\\'t add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you\\'re not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy\\'s eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.\\n\\nIt will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don\\'t doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.\\n\\nIf you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don\\'t expect something else because it will come back to you and there\\'s this verse in the Bible that I like that says \" what you plant, thats what will grow\" I don\\'t think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you\\'re a lair don\\'t be mad or don\\'t ask God why is he doing this to you because that\\'s what you planted in the beginning. Sometimes it is almost impossible for first impressions to change but its never to late it could come to the time it does.. First Impressions are almost impossible to change this is true but they can also slightly change a little bit over time. I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk', \"School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else.\\n\\nTo conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.   . The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development.\\n\\nThird, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule.\\n\\nFirst, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students\\n\\nSecond, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest\", 'Strength and fitness could also be improved from increased physical activity and reducing the risk of health problems. Improved grades can result from an enhanced sense of motivation in students to strive to reach the B threshold, and also from the development of a stronger work ethic required to balance sport and school activities. \\nThe proposed policy to require a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams could have a number of positive effects. \\n\\nOn the flip side, this policy could discourage some students from taking part in school athletics. Those who do not meet the minimum grade may become disillusioned with study due to their exclusion from the sports team, which could consequently have a negative impact on their academic performance and grades. Additionally, those with financial limitations may be unable to afford extra tuition to catch up on their studies in order to meet the B grade requirement.. Furthermore, the ability to demonstrate college-level commitment and hard-work through showing sports performance, as well as improved grades, may help with college acceptance', 'It was fun to watch, and hear them while playig it was probably the best year i had in 3rd grade.\\n\\nThe people in your group are like your family you guys are going to travel together and perform together. . Thats why practicing is important.\\n\\nHaving fun while playing in band or orchestra your able to travel to diffrent states to learn how difrrent groups play,\\n\\nlearn diffrent songs, and learn the sites of that certain city. Thats why I joined orchestra when I was about 9-10years old I learned about 20 new songs that 1 school year and I loved doing it. YouCAn also make friends in the new state you travelled to thats why playing an intrument is so enjoyable. Being enspired by someone to do that instrumet or what ever you want to do you need somone to motivate you for example, their was this one time where my brother motivated me to play the chello and I did and it felt good,because I practiced everydaycand I loved doing it. And even making freinds to the new kids who join later in the year so dont worry about being left out while traveling to that certain state your always going have someone to talk to be around. An enjoyable educational activity could be playing an intrument,an intrument could teach someone to practice everyday,by practicing could lead you to learning new techniques to play that type of instument', 'By making the switch, companies can reduce the amount of energy they use, which can lead to lower bills. \\n\\nHowever, there are also numerous disadvantages to instituting such a schedule. \\n\\nUltimately, it is important to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work or school week. While the idea of having a three-day weekend may seem appealing, there are both pros and cons that must be considered before making this switch. Additionally, businesses can save money by reducing the amount of personnel that they need, and schools can save money on things like facility costs and transportation. Additionally, students in a longer school day may have difficulty staying motivated for the extra two hours each day. \\nWith many organizations facing budget cuts and an unpredictable economy, more and more businesses and schools are beginning to consider the idea of instituting a 4-day, 10 hour work week or school week. \\n\\nOne of the main advantages of reducing the work week or school week to four days is the potential cost savings that can be achieved. Decisions should be made based not only on cost savings, but also on the potential impact that such a schedule could have on productivity, morale, and overall quality of life.. For instance, many employees may struggle to stay focused during a 10-hour workday and may find their productivity declining due to exhaustion', \"Poor habits like bad diet, inactivity, or lack of discipline can be severely detrimental to achieving goals.

Instead of not doing something in order to accomplish yourself', \"Have you ever heard the term majority rules? It means if more than half rule on one side, then that side will win. Many organizations and committees use majority rules because it means they are taking advice from multiple people and not just one. Taking opinions from multiple people may help someone with making a better choice. I believe it could give options to the wisdom seeker, it could make them confident about one choice that they could go with, and it would mean they would have multiple arguments for a side.\\n\\nWhen someone takes an opinion from multiple people, they have more choices/pieces of wisdom. If a person is writing an article and needs advice on what to write, they go to one person and only get one piece of advice to help them with their article. If they go to multiple people, they have options to weigh and decide what they want to write on. One example of this is Congress. Before any bill passes, they all take a vote. Whichever side is more than half will win, which is majority rules coming back into play. Congress does this to see what others have to say about the topic, not just what one person has to say. This is one of the reasons why taking more than one opinion can help someone make wise choices.\\n\\nLast summer, I played on a travel basketball team that went to Maryland every weekend and played in a tournament. I was the point guard on the team, which meant that I was the captain on the court. I was calling plays, running pep talks, and keeping my teams head up. One Saturday, my dad and I drove up to the tournament and when I got there, all my teammates were excited. They started telling me about how easy our schedule was and how we could easily win this tournament. Our first game came and on the first play of the game, I twist my ankle. I sat the rest of the game out and my 2nd game as well. I told my dad that I would be fine to play in the championship, but he told me that I couldn't. Furthermore, I asked my coach, and he told me that I should not\\xa0take the risk. Furthermore, I was mad that my coach and my dad said I shouldn't play, but we're still ending up winning. The moral of the story was that I took my dad's and my coach's advice and decided not to play. Since I got the advice from 2 trusted adults that I knew, I understood that it was probably the smartest decision for me to make. Taking advice from multiple people can make someone more confident about their choice on the topic.\\n\\nGetting multiple opinions on a topic such as a debate article may not always mean he/she is right, but it means that they have multiple people's arguments on the topic. Bor's example, if I asked around about child soldiers and I had multiple people tell me that they shouldn't be given amnesty, I could use their arguments to my side even if they should be given amnesty. If someone takes advice from different people, and they all tell you along the same lines of the same piece of advice, they could use it even if it's wrong, because they have people standing behind them with the same argument and same reasons.\\n\\nTaking advice from multiple people is more helpful than taking it from 1 person because it helps give options to someone who might need it for a test or a scenario in their life. It is also helpful when someone knows the advice they need, but they want to check with others to see if they're thinking the same way about the scenario. The last reason of why it is important is that even if someone takes advice from many others and the advice is wrong, he/she has their arguments to help you out. This information is very important at the moment because right now the world is tasked with something they could use a lot of advice on. The Coronavirus is a disease that has 115,000 cases all around the world and the U.S. has 574 cases. The world has not found a cure yet, and I believe that scientists are trying to find the cure themselves, so they can get all the credit. If all the scientists in the world worked together and used each other's advice and equipment, we could find a cure very easily and quickly. This is an example of using multiple people's advice because there could be 2 scientists who are very close to finding the cure and if they work together they could easily find the cure.  \", \"In addition to their expertise, experts and authorities are also better equipped to consider all the potential risks and outcomes of a situation, making them an important source of guidance. \\n\\nOn the other hand, had John consulted experts or authorities about his life's important matters, his decision may have been different.

One is to say that, in order to be successful in life, one must learn to compete. Another is to say that, in order to be successful in life, one must learn to cooperate. I happen to believe that, in order to be successful in life, one must learn to do both.\\n\\nCompetition is important because it teaches people how to strive IOR excellence. In a competitive environment, people learn how to push themselves to their limits in order to achieve their goals. This is an important skill to have, especially in the business world.\\n\\nHowever, cooperation is also important because it teaches people how to work together. In a cooperative environment, people learn how to put the needs oi others before their own. This is an important skill to have, especially in the world oi politics.\\n\\nBoth competition and cooperation are important skills to have in life. I believe that, in order to be successful, one must learn to do both.\\n\\n', 'Fight for what you desire in life, don\\'t let anyone get in negativity go through your head just turn it to them something postive or take that negativity and use as motivation to make you work harder in life to show them what you can do by yourself.\\n\\nLife is everything you have one live to live to fullest your parents has brought you into this world becasue he knows you have something speical hidden you that can maybe change the world .

Nobody can\\'t make you want you don\\'t want to do life because it\\'s your life not theirs they can\\'t tell you what you can do or not, like no you\\'re the that can control you body, mind and life not them.\\n\\nThe one person who has my back since I was kid and encourage me to keep from giving up in life is my older brother. Then after all that he learned that he will never let the haters get into his head and take his life and use him like a toy, so he told me that is that if people try to do use you or say that can\\'t be this in the future all you have to is do ignore everyone who tries to get in the way in the way of your life. He told that I can live my life how I want it to live because nobody can\\'t make your decisions what you want or not to do. Always be yourself and live your life how you want to live it and never give up. He told me that he has gone through a lot things in the past like the people that he called as \"friends\" or \"family\"\\n\\ntry to take advantage of him what he didn\\'t want to things that they wanted him to do, so what he did was that is he spoke up to all the people that wanted to do this and that you can\\'t tell him what to do or can\\'t push me to doing things that he doesn\\'t like. I believe everyone can achieve there by just following there heart and mind with no one interfering what you like to do for a living, but if you get lost or need help along your path to success ask someone that is very close to you that you know who has back no matter what that understand you that ain\\'t trying to ruin your life should always choose people wisely.            . Should people judge you what you want to do in life? or should you follow what your heart desire that is right for you? I think you should live your life how you want it to live it, what you want to achieve in the future, what is your main goal to do when you\\'re done with high school or college', \"Working with a group in my opinion is something that should never happen, you might be asking why?. When i work with other people i feel like it doesn't benefits me because they are either cheating or not helping, working by myself makes me feel more me, it makes me want to keep going without having to worry about others. Now working by yourself gives you more benefits like, no one is going to steal your ideas or just copy what you do or write about which happens a lot when you are working with a team.\\n\\nWorking with a group is more like team work, is more like people doing less, what i mean by people doing less is that when you are working with a group you normally don't do a lot, you are all helping each others and that makes you more like a person that is not secure of yourself, is like a person that will always need someone to be helping you\\n\\nWorking with a group is not too bad but it can be, me as a student i do like to work with my friends but they always copying me which i do not like, it makes me feel like they will not be able to do good in life without me.

This student's experience therefore differed from other similar programs where there was a more even mix of the different age groups.\\n\\nGiven the challenge that programs with both older and youngest students can face, there are a few strategies that can help to address this. It is important to consider the impact of this intergenerational mix on both younger and older students.\\n\\nFor example, an essay described a student's experience in such a program in which the older students often contributed to the lack of learning for the younger students. \\nIt can be difficult for students of different ages to learn from each other in the same educational environment due to their differences in knowledge levels and diverse experiences. Additionally, designing lesson plans to ensure that all students are engaged and learning together can also be beneficial.\\n\\nOverall, programs with both older and youngest students can present some challenges due to the differences in knowledge and experience between the two age groups. However, by implementing strategies to address the issue such as tailoring curriculum and engaging in lesson plans, this can help to achieve a successful learning experience for all students.. For instance, creating curriculum specifically tailored for different ages can be beneficial. The older students may have more experience and knowledge than their younger peers and as a result, they could overwhelm the younger students\", 'The object in the picture is not an alien artifact, because land forms on Mars that look funny are Caused by shadows, the picture quality was not good, and the Camera on the last time Would of saw buildings and even planes.\\n\\nThe object in the picture was not an alien artifact, because the land on Mars has many hills Called Martian mesa. A Martian mesa is like a sand dune it is mound of sand and dirt, so for this to be an alien artifact is very unlikely. These mesas are very Common on Mars, because it says,\"Scientists figured it was just another Martian mesa, Common enough around Estonia.\" This shows that it was just another mound of sand and dirt that had a weird shadow that made it look like a faze.\\n\\nThe second piece of evidence is that, the picture quality was not very Clear in the first two pictures.

Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day.\\n\\nCommunity parks have a lots space playing. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Community parks has it all open space, sun ,green grass, tables and a nice setting in general.\\n\\nCommunity park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments.

Spending time with peers with different interests can lead to a more fulfilling workplace environment. In addition, collaboration can result in the acquisition of new knowledge due to the diversity of perspectives present. To sum up, there are many advantages to working in a group, from saving time and incorporating new information to making friends in the workplace.. By working with others, one gains the opportunity to manage their time more effectively, as multiple people can contribute to a task and complete it more quickly. Furthermore, group work is an effective way to make new friends. For instance, a research team with members from different backgrounds will be able to approach their task from varied angles, and combine them to form a more comprehensive understanding', '\\nPartnership is an integral part of any learning experience. Working together to achieve a common goal allows individuals to discuss and debate ideas as well as collaboratively problem solve. Furthermore, having multiple people in a learning environment allows for a more efficient distribution of work, enabling learners to go further and more in-depth. This approach is especially effective in the classroom setting, where students can work together to gain a better understanding of the material. By engaging in partnerships, learning is simultaneously enhanced and improved.. When working with a partner, it is also possible to get “second opinions” and different viewpoints on a particular topic or subject. It is through this exchange of ideas and input that learning can be deepened and strengthened. Working in groups also encourages everyone to engage more actively with their learning, opening up the possibility for further exploration and learning. When working in groups, each member can bring something unique to the situation and work together to form a bigger picture of the topic', 'The students need to be more activity person. If the people are an inactivity person that mean they can not have any purpose, so the people never has to be an inactivity person. The people need to always do somethings for their life.

To be a lazy person do not have any purpose in the life. If the people always do somethings, that people can change the ways how can be their future life. Though most people think the inactivity serve a purpose however, the people always need to doing things in their lives. To be a inactivity person in young age can have a big a effect in the future.

The people feels lazy to move around looking for work and they only waste their time doing nothing.                  . When the students become in adults they think all are going to be easy for them like student years.

Students are said to retain a substantial amount of information that was discovered in the previous school year, and this can be beneficial for continued development. \\nMany students and parents eagerly anticipate the summer break, looking forward to days spent relaxing, travelling, and engaging in leisure activities. For example, the extra time away from the classroom can lead to a sense of forgetfulness and decreased motivation to learn. Moreover, having a longer break has been thought to improve social and emotional development by giving students time to develop new skills and pursue new interests. \\n\\nStill, some studies suggest a longer summer break can have a negative effect on learning. \\n\\nIn terms of academic benefits, research suggests that when students return after a long summer break, there is a decrease in the amount of knowledge forgetting. It also provides an extra few weeks for students to continue or start an academic pursuit, such as a summer course or program. A comparison of a regular summer break to one that is shorter reveals that there are advantages and downsides to each.  Ultimately, each school must weigh the positives and negatives of extending summer breaks and make their own determination on what length of break is most appropriate for their particular students.. Even with the positive aspects, it is important to assess the impact a long summer break has on students' ability to retain information, and consider potential ways to keep them engaged during the break\", 'So people get tired to help and they continue in the same way. For example if i saw someone who is close to me like my best friend or something like that and they have a bad behavior.\\n\\nI will try to find ways to helping being kind, nice, social and give new perspective to other people. For example you can have a Social life, Friendly smile, Nice peronality, Kind and all of the others specialityes.

They don\\'n wanna put their part for be a better person, influenece for give new perspective. You have to know who are your real friends and who are not.\\n\\nFor instances, People can have a opportnity to had a better life, future is the kind of people who had a bad behavior. So that are the reasons why cause not all of your friends be there for your when you need someone can be for you; True friends and good influeces be there anytime that you need help or talk to them that\\'s why you had to select your friends. some of the friends when they saw it that you in trouble they don\\'t talk to you anymore. Because they are awesome kind of persons or parents can\\'t get the control of them.\\n\\nHowever, they are true friends who love you, help you to had a normal behavior some of youre\\'re friends not all of them.

For example, in my opinion I love being in an extracurricular activity. After a while of being in an extracurricular activity you get very ft reffed. Extracurricular activities are sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. The principal at Generic_School had decided that all students must participate in an activity, but not everyone agreed with high decision. I disagree that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because not all students have the time to be in an extracurricular activity, and students have left time in their regular chaffed.\\n\\nTo begin with, I disagree that all students must participate in an activity because not all students have the time to be in an activity. An extracurricular activity if fueled for some of the students. According to teacher students get free having to deal with an activity at school. Students worry about the activities and could get distracted. More project for work having to deal with. Also most students are not very interested in sports, working on the yearbook, or serving on the student council. Students could also free parents with project and more work from the activities that they have to deal with. For example, my friend Generic_Name get ft reffed with the work he already had in cliff and an extracurricular activity would not be very helpful for him.\\n\\nFurthermore, students would have left time in their regular helpful chaffed. Having left time in their regular chaffed make teacher also free. Teacher have left time in cliff to teach students what they need to learn. Students learn left and goof more around in the activities. The grade of students could decrease\\xa0badly because they are not learning enough. Also not all students are caught up in cliff, and they would have left time in cliff to finish their makeup work. For example, some students do not show up to school, and they would not have much time to catch up with the work that other students have finished in cliff.\\n\\nAdditionally, I disagree that all students at Generic_School should be required to be in an extracurricular activity. Once my friend Generic_Name weigh in two extracurricular active he weigh very ft reffed after only two week. He had for much work he owed and did not have enough time in cliff to catch up. So my friend Generic_Name decided to convince high principle to take the extracurricular activities away. The reason weigh because\\xa0the activities made students free too much. I do not agree that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity because not all students have the time to deal with an extracurricular activity, and students have left time in their regular chaffed.', 'Emerson wrote extensively about individualism and self-reliance, encouraging people to stay true to themselves and to take responsibility for their emotions, actions, and choices.\\n\\nEmerson believed being yourself was one of the most important steps to achieve true spiritual self-sufficiency. He encouraged readers to remain true to themselves despite the external pressures and judgments from society or other people. Staying true to yourself and embracing individualism can help you make meaningful connections, build strong relationships, and find greater satisfaction and success. They may argue that conforming to the norms of society is necessary for success and that individualism can be detrimental to one’s career and social life. According to Emerson, one can only benefit from staying true to themselves and should not be swayed by the opinions of others.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some people may think that it is not advantageous to be an individual self. Emerson argues that these personal benefits are more important than the short-term gains that come from following the expectations of society.. \\nRalph Waldo Emerson was a prominent figure of the American Literary Renaissance of the 19th century and is widely regarded as one of the most influential writers of the era. However, Emerson argued that staying true to your own convictions and your authentic self is the key to happiness.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is best to be yourself rather than be someone you are not', 'Even though, that people had adversities they always had a positive attitude towards the problems, that hope they needed to become someone. The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.\\n\\nIt has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier.\\n\\nFirst, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. To be positive in life is really important, since it helps people to face problems and become successful. For example, in the text \"People Who Became Successful After Adversities\", many people had a hard time before becoming successful. A positive attitude can change the view of the problems. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. To see the good side of the things in life help to be successful. When people have a good attitude toward a problem, to face it becomes easier since people will look for a solution instead of being stuck. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. The importance of having a positive attitude can be bigger of what some people may think. Having a good attitude help people to not give up when facing adversities.\\n\\nFurthermore, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because it makes things easier. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through. A positive attitude describes how much effort people are putting into the problems they are facing. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life.\\n\\nTo summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things.               . A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life.\\n\\nMany people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, a person with a positive attitude will always see the good side of the problems. Some people may say that a positive attitude is not always needed to become successful, however a positive attitude is the key to success in life. The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something', \"However, potential risks and drawbacks must be weighed against the potential advantages to make an informed decision.. They may lack the polish and be behind in certain skills needed for the next journey. They would also miss out on the networking, connections, and experiences that would help them further their education or career.\\n\\nIn conclusion, graduating early can be a great way to benefit a student's education and career prospects. On the positive side, graduating early can allow a student to jump ahead in their college or job career. \\nGraduating early can be a very beneficial way to further a student's education or career, but there are some potential risks that should be considered. Early graduates may not be as prepared as their peers for the next step in their career or education. It may enable them to start their career earlier, or even give them the opportunity to pursue further education or specialized courses.\\n\\nThe drawbacks, however, can be significant\", 'It can instill a deeper level of motivation, leading to increased productivity and resilience. More importantly, failure can be one of the most powerful catalysts for success. While it may initially seem daunting, the lessons and knowledge provided from failure should be looked at as an opportunity to grow. By failing and coming to terms with the failure, I was able to develop a better understanding of how to work smarter and plan for things better in the future. Although it was initially hard to grapple with, I eventually realized that the experience had helped me to grow as a person. It can be a pivot point where people decide to stand up, take action, and strive towards their goals with increased ambition and determination.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that failure can have tremendous benefits for humans in the long run. \\nWhen I look at failure, the first thing I think about is how much I have learned from personal experiences. One of the most influential experiences I have had with failure was when I missed a goal I had set for myself when I was younger. Failure can also be seen as a learning experience and spark self-reflection, as it gives people an opportunity to reassess their current strategies and formulate a better plan or approach. Failure can help sharpen our skills, belief in ourselves, and provide an authentic platform to persevere towards success.. \\n\\nOverall, failure is not something most people desire, yet it can be a productive process', \"\\nImagination can be an incredibly powerful tool for achieving success. It enables us to go beyond our known boundaries and explore possibilities that we had not considered before. It gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new, explore uncharted territory, and extend the boundaries of what is possible. In short, it gives us the confidence and motivation to try something new and make it happen.\\n\\nTake the example of Elon Musk, who envisioned a world in which electric cars become the norm and space exploration was feasible for everyone. It's essential to understand the science behind what we are creating, but without creative ideas to guide us, all the knowledge in the world is useless.\\n\\nIn summary, imagination is just as important as knowledge when it comes to achieving success. Imagination allows us to dream, devise plans, and think outside the box. Through his imagination he was driven to build the electric car company Tesla and SpaceX. Knowledge without creativity and imagination is like driving a car without a destination. Without imagination, knowledge alone cannot be leveraged effectively to manifest the desired dreams and ambitions.. His successful vision was made possible by his ingenious imagination rather than sheer knowledge.\\n\\nOn the other hand, knowledge is important in the process of achieving success, however, without imagination, it is unlikely that this knowledge can be leveraged effectively\", 'In addition, proponents argue that having more time in school allows teachers to cover more content in greater depth, giving students the opportunity to delve more deeply into the topics they are learning about. While having more time in school can provide students with opportunities to strengthen their academic skills, it can also be detrimental to their health and well-being. Studies have shown that when students have too little sleep and too much stress, their academic performance and motivation decreases. This could involve shorter school hours and more optional activities such as sports and art classes, as well as providing students with access to mental health support services. Furthermore, the mental and physical strain of extended school hours could be a contributing factor to the rising rates of anxiety and depression among teens. By providing students with these means of support and free choice, we can ensure that their academic performance and well-being are both prioritized.. \\n\\nUltimately, I believe that the best way to ensure academic success is to provide students with a balanced education that puts their mental and physical health first. Supporters cite the benefits of giving students more time to develop their learning and practice the skills needed for academic success. \\nThere are valid arguments to be made both for and against extending school hours. On the other hand, detractors claim that longer school hours can be detrimental to students’ physical and mental health, ultimately leading to greater burnout and decreased academic achievement. \\n\\nAfter giving careful consideration to the arguments on both sides, I believe that longer school hours should not be implemented', \"So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.\\n\\nIn conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life.

Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!\\n\\n2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.\\n\\n1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend\", '\\nExtending school hours has become a controversial issue among educators, parents, and students alike. With more time available, students could participate in councils and activities that promote problem-solving and teamwork. Longer school hours make it possible for teachers to spend more time exploring complex topics and for students to build deeper understanding of course material. Lastly, it could give students an opportunity to interact more with teachers. Firstly, students would have more time to focus on their academics. Supporters of this plan argue that it would offer students more quality time to focus on their studies, develop skills, and interact with their instructors. In addition, spending more time in the classroom puts more strain on students who are already trying to balance school with other responsibilities such as sports teams, internships, and jobs. \\n\\nThe pros of extending school hours are numerous. Spending more time with instructors outside of the classroom can help create a closer, more meaningful, student/teacher relationship.\\n\\nOn the other hand, longer school hours could also result in stressful conditions for students. Oftentimes, already tight student/family schedules could be disrupted due to the added time commitment. Secondly, extending school hours could offer students the opportunity to engage in extracurricular activities. However, when weighing the pros and cons, it is important to take all factors into consideration and ensure that any potential policy changes are in the best interests of all involved.. Lastly, some argue that extended hours could extend to a loss of valuable sleep, resulting in poorer learning outcomes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there are some valid arguments both for and against extending school hours. However, there are also those who argue that extending school hours would put too much stress on students and disrupt their already tight schedules', 'When you first meet a person for the first time, it is good to have a positive attitude towards the person so that they see a good impression of yourself and how you are as a person. theres many ways of having a good, bad, and persuasive attitude when you meeting a person, businessman, and even a friend. also having a bad impression on the job you are trying to get, wont get you the job because of how you are behaving or using words or even body posture says a lot about a person.\\n\\nGood impression that you show the first time to a person meets you be kind and just have a good attitude so people will have the same to you. leaving someone with a bad impression can have a big or negative impact in their life for example when you first meet a person you wanna date they could leave you with a good impression but over time that person can change the way they feel about you and you see that a they are changing as person which many people arent comftarble with change of a person. it doesnt always have to be about character this could go for anything even including: movies, video games, and television shows. being good to people in life can alway have a positive outcome. meeting someone for the first time is a way to show them who you are but that impression never changes because they know that you are that person of character. dont always be god to people that treat you bad and run you over and over again.\\n\\ni think its best to havea good frist impression to anyone you meet in your life because those people will like you and some will not like you at all, but being the best of yourself to your potential can be amazing at times but always have a positive mind set about impressing other people and its not always about impressingother people its also about having that thought of being your best at all times.. i think that the first impression towards a person can be like how they view you as a whole. they can have a strong impact on you, even little kids that are growing up that watch TV, those television show have a first time impression towards them.\\n\\nMeeting a person with a bad attitude/ impression can show you that they are not good for you or even around the people that you hang out with, many people tend to have the impression of a cool and awesome person when in reality they arent that person, many people try to put up an image so people think that you are \"awesome\" or \"cool\"', 'Do you think imagination is more important than knowledge?

Knowledge is not important than imagination because knowledge you have to learn about it to make sure you no what you talking about but imagination is when you imagine something in your life that you know is going to happen in your life one day is as fun as everything in the world that can make you happy in life or a point of your life.\\n\\nSo ne time i was playing soccer with my friends outside in the rain and I imagined myself making it on the school team I was very happy when I made on the school team', 'Therefore, riding bikes is an amazing activity for outdoors, you can enjoy riding along the streets, and to enjoy the outside nature by looking around the park and to hear the people playing around having fun outside.\\n\\nOn the other hand, doing any other activities are good to enjoy outside. For one, playing catch is a good activity to enjoy with others, and to move around. What ever activity is interesting to do outdoors to spend time on, then just do it to enjoy it.. For example, playing football is a good game to spend time outside practicing or playing with friends, and tag is another game that kids love enjoying outside running around and laughing and playing fair with other childrens on the grass or even just chasing little things that they see, like a dog they like to go after a dog and pet it.\\n\\nConclusion.

To achieve success one must not be discouraged by failure, but to use it as a learning experience and keep going with determination and courage. On one hand, Churchill\\'s quote highlights the fact that success, while valuable, is not static and there is always more to be done. This encourages individuals to strive for continuous improvement and progress in their lives. However, I used Churchill\\'s words as a source of hope and motivation; regardless of my failures, I had the courage to push on and eventually graduate with much success. No matter how difficult the journey becomes, the courage and determination to continue will allow one to eventually reach their goals.. This quote spoke to me directly and showed me that failure was just a necessary step in the journey to success. \\n\\nUltimately, Churchill\\'s quote is a potent reminder that it is never too late to start again and to continue striving for excellence no matter the setbacks encountered. \\n\\nI relate to this quote personally; when I was in graduate school, I struggled to keep up with my classes and often felt adrift', \"\\nBeing active and having an active lifestyle can have many benefits and drawbacks. Additionally, staying active can help maintain a healthy weight, and can even help one to look and feel better. Staying active can also help one's mental health, as studies have shown that regular physical activity can help reduce levels of stress and depression. Engaging in regular physical activity and staying active can help one achieve overall physical and mental wellbeing, and can also help reduce the risks of many serious diseases.. Exercising and participating in physical activities can place physical strain and stress on the body, which can lead to aches, pains, and injuries if one is not careful. Additionally, not all forms of exercise are equal, and certain activities can involve more risk than others.

Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.\\n\\nIn conclusion they can't take classes online because they will have a lot of benefits that the students who is going to school and they can sleep a lot and the regular student has to wake up early and they can't have benefit with grades or other benefits,\\n\\nIn my opinoin students should not to take classes online because that is going to be more easy than the stduent who take classes at school becuase the students who is in the school they are not going to have he same benefits as the students who take classes online.. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online.\\n\\nThe students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. In this paragraph I will write about how students can take classes from their homes and if they are going to do good in the works that the teachers give to the students on online, talk to the cousolers or tho his admistrator, the students will have some benefit, Students will have benefits with the grades.\\n\\nIf the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home\", \"most students wont have to get uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods. Eating junk food could make you tired and you won't have theenergy to do anything. Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Students wont be so tempted to eat it, and could chose a better and healthier choice.\\n\\nMost students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. adding more healthier choices in th school caferteria meun could help them stay in shape. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out becuase of how the food is made. most students don't workout so they depend on the food they eat. And staff members that get lunch from the cafeteria could enjoy having a healthier lunch.\\n\\nin conclusion changing the schools cafeterias meun to much healthier choice would be good for students and staff members so they could stay healthy and focus.. Its better to take away the opition of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out.\\n\\nI think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and its healthy for students to eat and enjoy. Changing our school meun to much healthier choice's is a good idea because its good for the students to eat much healthier food in school\", 'Demonstrate the people that was supporting us what we did to make them proud and we know how good we are going to feel that day. It is so much emotions going on and we can\\'t describe the feeling after we went through all that and we finally did it,we got our purpose we make it and the feeling of victory is inexplicable,we need more positivism in us.. It is necessary to take our time to make this things possible, it is necessary to have clearly our mind and see what are we capable to do and how far we can go . Quit is the easy way to give up , and that is they way to demonstrate weakness the people that didn\\'t trust in us would laugh and spread the rumors of our fail. We don\\'t need to take care of what others say, they might give us advises but we are the only ones deciding our actions.\\n\\nWhat the quote means is how we make bad decisions an sometimes we just do what others do,or we just quit to something we were trying to do and it was hard so we drop off that and now we don\\'t do anything else than watch others happy for getting their purpose. We won\\'t feel good after that and we\\'ll feel embarrass of ourselves , we wouldn\\'t be capable of going out with our mind thinking in what other people is thinking . Unluckily purposes don\\'t come by itself as a miracle. There is a lot of people doing a lot of activities everyday and some others doing nothing than just watch TV. Among the time the girl started to eat healthier and started to walk everyday she was adding one more lap ,then she started to jug and after run . What we can really do is confront the reality , understand our mistakes try to solve them ,try to get better by the time . Every person has a different purpose,some purposes are complicated to reach,and there\\'s also some less complicated but doesn\\'t make any difference because every person decides and picks what are their purposes and whether if they give up or they do anything to reach them. This is a experience that taught me to see different the things , to see how we can do it\\n\\n, if we want , if we put a lot of effort and we are patient to see the changes. If we fall down we need to stand up again , dropping some tears and being in bed all day won\\'t help , think in what other people might think about us won\\'t do anything than just make us feel even more weak. Each human person in the world have a purpose , goal to get in a future and is something that we really want to have in our life. We are trying we aren\\'t being like the rest and that make us unique ans specials, show to whoever said we could\\'t do it or make it how wrong they were and they judge us before knowing our capacities. After everything we\\'ll feel great and proud of what we\\'ve done.\\n\\nIt is hard to try without being scared , without doubt .Believe in our capacities is something that we stopped doing , and say I can\\'t became more common and we hear that everyday. This is so truth , we don\\'t see in ourselves first , we spend more time critizating and wishing bad luck to those making their purposes , feeling jealous of them because they could do it and we could\\'t because we didn\\'t want to put effort and time so we\\'d rather give up and do nothing than just complain about it and make excuses .That is not a reason , choosing a goal or purpose is something we need take it seriously because if you take it like a game then we are wasting your time , and the time of those person\\'s helping us and going through all our steps , in our mentality has to be all positive .Being more strong than our bad thoughts feel proud of us,because we are doing something that others can\\'t do. Always is better to try than just watch .Everyone has their daily things to do , some people work , others study , others do both or more things and they don\\'t have time for them. We don\\'t do things we want to do because of our insecurities and our laziness when there is a lot of people dying to have an opportunity. It won\\'t be perfect at the first try , it may not be the same thing that we were expecting, but the effort you put is what it counts. A lot of girls bother her, and others saw her crying and hurt and they didn\\'t stop them. A lot of people accomplish more if they are always doing something and others ask if inactivity also serve as a purpose. Her bones and body develop she got skinnier and after she got back to school everyone got impressed .Now she was more confident and it wasn\\'t easy , it took time , tears , sacrifices but she did it . No one is perfect we might see people getting their purposes easily and we can\\'t understand how , what we don\\'t know is the reality of how the live by the way we don\\'t need to be comparing our live with others life .\\n\\nA girl from school had extra weight and she didn\\'t played any sports , she was lazy to walk and all her friends were skinny and she felt bad about herself and very ashamed of her body she tried to lose weight but slowly she was quitting ,she was crying a lot and feeling weird and unwanted by everyone , some students started to judge her and no one wanted be her friend and they were bullying her .

Thomas Jefferson wrote \"Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing\".\\n\\nSome person\\'s give up easily, they think is impossible, hard, complicated, but basically what they are doing is waste their capacity to make something and improve themselves, just because someone doesn\\'t trust in our capacity means we have to stop doing what we like and quit . We can\\'t limit ourselves with good stuff we need to spend time and learn new things , experience , teach other people and share our experiences and recommend and help others to never quit. At the beginning of every subject we want to experience by doing it ,is hard , we got anxiety, nervous,sad,happy', \"Gun control is a big issues in lots of countries. Peoples got diff'rent opinions on it. Me, I think we need stricter gun control laws. Because, like, there's too many shootings and stuff.\\n\\nFirst reason is that guns r dangerous. They can oil peoples. Accidents can happen. Or peoples can get angry and shoot sum1. It's just too risky. My friend, his cousin, he got shot by his friend. He didn meant to, but he was playing around, and it went off. Xow he's in a wheelchair. It's just sad.\\n\\nSecond reason is that there's too much violence. In America, there's like a mass shooting every week. It's crazy. Peoples got guns, and they think they can do whatever they want. They shoot up schools, churches, concerts. Its like, why can't we just have a nice life? Why we have to be scared of getting shot?\\n\\nThird reason is that guns r easy to get. Anybody can get one. You don't need a license or anything. Just go to a store and buy one. That's not right. There should be stricter laws. Make it harder for peoples to get guns.\\n\\nFourth reason is that guns r not just for hunting. Peoples say they need guns for hunting. But that ain't true. They want guns for protection. But you don't need a gun to protect yourself. There's other ways. Like, you can learn self defense. Or just call the cops.\\n\\nFifth reason is that stricter gun control laws work. In countries where they have stricter laws, there are less shootings. Like, in Australia, they have strict laws and hardly no shootings. Its just common sense.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, we need stricter gun control laws. Guns r dangerous, there's too much violence, guns r easy to get, they are not just for hunting, and stricter laws work. We have to do sum thin bout this. We can't just sit around and let peoples get killed. It's time for change.\", \"When it is time to practice the game we do not have energy to play, so that is the cause we lost the game every time. Sometimes family want to explore places for example; New York, Florida, and Boston that state has beautiful place to swim play, and we can do everything. Sometimes the first thing we can do is eating, and then go to sleep this is not a good choice for them.\\n\\nPlease help all the students who is trying to work and continuing to go to school, because they are the future on the world. Students failure the game every time when we have a game with another team, because for some reasons they do not beat the game. We needed to work a part-time on that way we got more time to practice the game, so the next time we can win the game. Sometimes famous death for that kind of reason, so we need to learn about the experience. Game is an important thing they can learn too much, and maybe in the future they can get a award like a professional or famous on games.\\n\\nSome students do not have time to practice, because they need to work to pay the bills for example; pay the insurance for the car, pay the rent where they live, and also pay the bill for the cellphone. That's is the reason we do not have time to practice. Sometimes student do not sleep as well, or they do not have much energy to play, because they do not eat before start the game. Sometimes the family do not help them, because they said we need to learn how they make a money to obtain the food for each person.\\n\\nEating healthy is good for everyone, so we need to eat every day. That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. Also we can eat fruit every time, because that has to much protein. they need to go the gym too, because that help you to get a healthy body. That's why student do not have time to practice the game. If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start                             . That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day. Life is very important for everybody, so we need to look what's the first thing we can do before they think and act too.\\n\\nFamily is more important than the game, so they do not have time to practice. Everybody needs to know before they have a game we need to eat healthy, and drink enough water. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams\", 'Even today, entrepreneurs and innovators rely on creative and ambitious risk-taking in order to create businesses, products, and services that solve problems and advance society.\\n\\nAdditionally, there are countless personal success stories of people who took the step to try something new and it changed their lives. From someone who learned a new language, to someone who changed careers, to someone who tried a completely different hobby, each of these individuals had to accept a challenge outside of their existing knowledge before they could experience personal growth. It is only when we are willing to take risks and learn new things that we can truly expand our capabilities and reach new heights.. The quote, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,\" is a great reminder of how important it is to step out of our comfort zone and take risks in order to progress.\\n\\nThe greatest accomplishments of humanity have come as a result of pushing our boundaries and trying to do something new and challenging. \\nNobody can deny that growth is a necessary element in our human experience which can affect both our personal and professional lives. Most of us can look at our own lives and recognize the same kind of successes – be it large or small – that have come from pushing ourselves to do something beyond our current level.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this quote succinctly captures the vital role that striving to accomplish something new and challenging plays in our growth. From inventing the telephone, to landing on the moon, to creating revolutionary medical treatments, every groundbreaking development can be traced back to a group of people who decided to move outside of their established skills and take a chance', \"Now your first impressions is ruined just like the car you thought look nice. Your first impressions from a car for sale change.\\n\\nSecond, this is my experiences with first impressions. Let's said that you go to the store and see something that you fall in love with at first impression and you buy it, but is not what you expect to be as you saw in the store because the commercial lie about the product .                                                                                                                                                                                                              . You think first impression would change a person or not? Some of are stuff that we have right now is because of first impression.\\n\\nIn this essay I will argue about First Impression. Now in 2019 the new IPhone 11 come out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sister phone.\\n\\nIn conclusion I think first impressions can be change. When I was 13 years old I thought that my sister phone have the best camera ever and best software ever. The feeling of first impressions everybody have it, but is not impossible to change it. Your first impressions about last change. For example you see a nice car for sale in you way home and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. Just try other placer where you can find the same product with best thing. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Next weak you see another car for sale close to your house, but this time the car does not engine problem and ruined interior like the last car you try. I would give you a example of how your first impressions can be change. Now you don't think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression.\\n\\nFirst, I disagree about First Impressions statement\", 'Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. New idea create diversity is the way to success.. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group.\\n\\nif one does not do work the only they fail. However, according to new Stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task.\\n\\nit lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working\\n\\n\"The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new idea\\'s. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone\\n\\nThough working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others.\\n\\nworking in a group is also good for getting other people\\'s opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Also being in a group fell safe. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity.\\n\\nAnother benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group\\n\\nThough working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes.\\n\\nAnother problem that can come up is well problem. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement.\\n\\nOverall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone.\\n\\nEvery body ha heard someone in their life say \" two minds are better than one\" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons', 'Germany, France, and Columbia, all have something in common, they are cutting down on car pollution. Car pollution is rising problem in the world, making up almost fifty percent of the United States\\' pollution and twelve percent in Europe. From making cars distinct from everyday life to banning all cars for a day, these countries are trying to cut down on the car pollution build up.\\n\\nOne of the biggest feats in trying to cut down car pollution is making it an unusual thing in everyday life for a city in Germany known as VAUBAN. This city does not ban cars but even then only about thirty percent of residents in this city own a car and fifty seven percent have sold their own cars to move here. This city is a home to a mere 5,500 residents, but they all live with in a rectangular square mile. This shows that it is possible to live without cars as personal transport and still be with in reach of stores, work and home.\\n\\nAnother city taking a big step in the fight against car pollution is the well known city of Paris, France. Paris has enforced a partial driving ban in its streets to hopefully clear or cut the air of pollution. The city has made an odd law, \"On Monday motorists with even numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22euro fine($31). The same would apply to odd numbered plates the following day.\" When this law was first enforced nearly 4,000 drivers were fined according to Reuters. This law was meant to exterminate the smog because the city was rivaling one of the most polluted cities in the world, Being, China.\\n\\nOne of the other cities creating an antiwar pollution act is Bogotá, Columbia. The city of Bogotá has created an annual \"Jay without cars\" which is fine with the residents. Instead of cars residents use bikes and buses and other modes of transportation to travel around the city. This event has been rubbing of on a fellow city in the area. The cut down on pollution here is slight but will slowly make an impact over time when this annual \"Jay without cars\" begins to take place in multiple other cities, hopefully, instead of these three cities.\\n\\nAvoiding car usage is a difficult feat to an everyday car user but if you can avoid it then it can really effect the environment positively. Making a day for no cars or at least a small amount of car usage can really impact the environment. This movement has even begun to start in the United States and hopefully will continue from then on into the future when we eventually have a lot of hueless cars for everyone to drive in.', \"But if you just come and take those sports away trust me its not going to be so good at all!

', \"The students will be using their cell phones in social media to talk to friends instead of focusing on their task. Cell phones are a great tool for anything , it is a mini computer. Nevertheless, distraction in the schools will be a problem, also the students will be less perceptive in class because the students will fail to maintain self control over their devices and the results will be disastrous in their future.\\n\\nTo begin, the students in the school should have all the things they need to learn such as books, they should not rely on the devices to give them certain information. Clearly, the user have to make a wise decision between using an information in their cell phones that could possibly be wrong, or use a textbook that it is revised by many authorized teachers.\\n\\nFurther more, in today's society there is social media which is use to stay in touch with close family members who are far away. For instance, if the school allowed such action, not only will be making a very poor decision but the school will earn a bad reputation from parents and even to the national level. Obviously, the teachers and staff will be unemployed by the county due to the lack of income from the state , teachers but not only students will be damaged by the decision that could be taken.\\n\\nOverall, having the ability to own a cell phone is a privilege to have not a right , teachers and administrators should take away the device from the student if and only if the student is not cooperating, and return it at the end of the school day or simply not bring it to school. This proves that it will not only hurt the kids academically but the school itself will have a downfall in popularity. The schools are now taking the advantage of the new technology , but along with the new use comes new problems.\\n\\nAlthough, using the technology in schools becomes a faster way to learn , most schools are relying in the new invention of the century. In conclusion, Cell phones are a great way to study and do some homework and stay in touch with family members but in school is a learning place where it should stay like that and cell phones should not take that away. For example, the internet has a wide variety of information which could have a negative or a positive impact on the user , also the information in the web is very inaccurate which could lead to misunderstanding. The World around us is a beautiful place , but we do not take notice.\\n\\nThe smart phones play a vital role in today's society , it is the hobby of the century.

The devices were not made to harm others in many ways that people have tried .Social media plays a role too in the students it is like a temptation in their pockets , they always have to update their status in social media and text their friends and stay off task. This shows that the students could gain wrong information and could be getting a misconception in the topic , which could lead to failure in academics and to achieve nothing in their future careers\", \"Later on, I'll be a famous tutor! If I'll be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then they'll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now I'll have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What I'm trying to say, helping you community isn't as bad. I mean if they're eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or don't want to do. For example, I'll pick, helping students in your classrooms. If I'll see or think that I'm good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. For me, I would choose helping the community, 'cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiment's basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. If your one of the lucky ones, you'll make your self a carrier, if not, keep on trying! And one important thing to no is, keep on trying, what you give, is what you'll receive.. In my personal opinion, I think that students should decide on their own. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do\", \"Are self-driving cars really safe for the future?\\n\\nDriving has been around for decades. It goes so far back. Now soon there will be no need for driving at all. Car will have to have a mind of their own. They'll need to know how to handle difficult situations. This will cause people to have to be attentive more than ever. I believe self-driving cars will be taken lightly and people will think they don't have to pay as much attention as they would a regular manual car.\\n\\nwhat do we really need selfdriving cars for anyways? I don't believe that a elecronic will be able to deal with other driving humans better than another human can. Say someone is driving an manual car and go on a four way stop at the wrong time. The car wouldn't know what to do unless its programed to do so. People may say The cars have sensors so it will be able to stop it's self. What if the sensor is broken? There will need to be way to tell that its broken. There will also be othe asspects of the car the driver will need to keep up with which will make this a high mantance car.\\n\\nAlong with this if there was to be an acident who would be responible? According to the article that is yet to be decided. There are still states that don't allow any driverless cars in their state which means everyone is not on borad with this idea. Its still people who think this idea is not safe. Also in these cars it is alot easier to be distracted. Like the article says some can get bored waiting on their time to drive. The driver can fall asleep, start using there phone, etc. Which could be dangerous for the manual drivers.\\n\\nThere are some positves to this car for some people. These cars could be good for new drivers who don't know how to parrallel park. Teen drivers don't always get everything right the first couple of times so they will ahve their car to assitst them. This car could also accually be safer for mothers with multipule children. It may give her a chance to quickly distribute a bottle or pick up a toy a baby dropped. This also can still be dangerous because the driver won't be attentive.\\n\\nIn conculdion i believe there is no point of taking time to make a driverless car because You will always have to be attentive just like driving a regular car, and if you aren't and get into an accident it may end up being your own fault. The driver would have to be dependent on their car to avoid accidents, construction, wrong turns ,etc. Will you be able to trust you car with your life?\", 'We the people shouldn\\'t be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isn\\'t as bad. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! that\\'s how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. People who don\\'t motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;I\\'m writing.\\n\\nAn inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who don\\'t accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time.                                                                                                                                                 . Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I don\\'t study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on.\\n\\nThomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President.\\n\\nThere are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you can\\'t depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like \"Yes! I did it!\"and that way they won\\'t have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. Also you want to have a break,so you won\\'t stress out as much. In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media.\\n\\nIn my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus.\\n\\nFor us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?\\n\\nThe way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. Thomas Jefferson wrote,\"Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing\"', \"Lastly, healthier meals often don't cause the “crash” that can result from sugary, fatty meals, reducing the likelihood of students feeling sleepy in the classroom. By replacing the regular options with healthier, more nutritious meals, students can also socialize with their peers while still Mastering new, healthier habits. \\n\\nHowever, there can be great difficulty in getting students to choose the healthier options. Replacing the burgers, fries, and pizza currently offered with more nutritious meals, such as salads, protein-rich dishes, and fresh fruit can significantly improve the concentration, focus, and motivation of students. \\n\\nIn conclusion, switching to healthier school lunch options could have a multitude of benefits for both the students and the school. As such, it is highly recommended that schools consider making the switch to healthier options.. It can improve academic performance, lay the groundwork for healthier habits, and reduce feelings of sleepiness in the classrooms. Some students may even feel that the healthier food choices are less satisfying and require additional effort to find the ingredients.\\n\\nNevertheless, there are still many potential benefits of providing healthier school lunch options, such as socialization.

In contrast, a rigid code of standards and adherence to traditional ideas of beauty can alienate us and limit our potential.\\n\\nIt is essential to take responsibility for our individual identities and never lose sight of our own values. Being ourselves in a society that is constantly trying to push us to fit into certain standards and expectations is no easy feat. On the other hand, refusing to conform to certain societal norms can lead to isolation and judgment.\\n\\nRegardless of the potential risks, embracing one’s true self can be one of the strongest steps we take towards building meaningful relationships and renegotiating our own identity. This challenge can come with both rewards and consequences. Through the promotion of self-acceptance we can achieve unity, not uniformity. In this way, instead of being programmed as replicas of pre-determined standards, we can be individuals that are both unique and united in our personhood.. On one hand, standing up for our beliefs and embracing our true selves can lead to a greater sense of self-fulfillment and satisfaction. \\nIn a world of constant comparison and criticism, it can be difficult to stay true to yourself', 'Undoubtedly, it can be beneficial to remain digitally connected with the world and have access to others’ insights and opportunities, however, it is also crucial to keep in mind that not everyone needs to know all the information about other people. \\n\\nWe live in a world where staying connected is becoming increasingly important; however, with these connections come some important caveats. However, it is also important to consider the risks associated with partaking in these activities as well; for example, scams, identity theft, and digital addiction. There are numerous potential benefits of engaging with these activities, such as the ease of access to people outside of your geographical area or the ability to purchase items without leaving your house. Maintaining the boundaries between private and public information can be difficult in our current online-focused culture, and therefore requires dedicated effort in order to do so. Thus, it is important to remain connected with the digital world, in order to keep up with the changing times, while also establishing limits on just how much time and energy are put into these activities.. \\n\\nIn the current digital age, online activities, such as shopping, playing games, and connecting with people on social media sites, have revolutionized the way in which groups of people interact', \"Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. .

The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. I am agree with the Emerson's statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong.\\n\\nBeing in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone.\\n\\nI am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly.\\n\\nIs difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful.

This will often cause a lack of focus and a from in their academic success. There should be other options for students to still get their education without having to actually go to school. Having a way to work from home eliminate those factors and could Possibly better students in their schoolwork. Therefor, students would benefit from distance learning because it will helm those in need of a flexed schedule, those with social anxiety, or for those with Parents who simple believe in homeschooling.\\n\\nThere are some People that can't be in a crowed of People because it causes them to get anxious. There are also People with other times of disorders that may lead them to need to be in the hospitals or just unable to function well with other People. People who are in situations like this can benefit from being able to take online classes because it can take away the discomfort of being around a large group of People. I have a friend who has social anxiety, and it causes her to have Manic attacks when she even sees a lot of People all at once. It would be a lot easier for her to be able to work from home, so she will be able to be focused on her work, and not scared of being in a group. Now some will say, People with those conditions need more human contact and all students need to be in an interactive classroom setting. This is just not true, if you are someone who won't be able to work with a large group going to school will defeat its Purpose because you won't be able to even learn Formerly. Also forcing someone with anxiety in those times of situation can just make it worse. Proving how helpful away from school leaning can be.\\n\\nAdditionally, Not only can this make students lives easier but Parents as well. There are Parents out there that Refer their children be homeschooled\\xa0because they don't like how the school systems are run. But those Parents may not have the time to be their children teacher. In a situation like this having distant learning can give that child a way to learn at home without their Parent having to stop working\\xa0to become their teacher. This also makes the Parent feel safe knowing their child is at home and away from a safety concerns that come from being in a school. Along with the annoying Phone calls and emails about their children's behavior or any other concerns the school will usually try contact get in contact about. My mother for one, is hates getting those calls throughout the day or emails flooding her inbox. This is a solution that can better everyone involved.\\n\\nFinally, having the ability to take classes online will give students the opportunity to still take care of their other daily obligations. Many students have to work, so they can Provide for their families. Others have to take care of their siblings. My cousin is one for example, My aunt Massed away on my cousins 18th birthday while she was a senior. With no other family living close to her, she was forced to be the guardian\\xa0of her younger sibling. Having to work and take care of other People can be a full time job on its on, but still needing to finish school in the Process makes it just that much more complicated. Having the chance to take classes online would make anyone in situations similar to this life much easier. This showing\\xa0the benefits this distant\\xa0leaning can have for certain students.\\n\\nIn conclusion students would benefit\\xa0from distance learning because depending on their situation that option will give them a chance to see what better works for them. And in cases like social anxiety, safety concerns of Parents and needing\\xa0a flexed schedule it can helm them still get an education in a way that is better for them. Being that not everyone has the same life and People have different way of getting information. This simply being an option can be extremely beneficial for students who need it.\\xa0\\xa0\", \"Have you ever wondered if you have extracurricular activities are getting in the way of your homework time or study time and if the activities you take should be up to the school or the student and his or her family? I'm going to explain why I believe the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers.\\n\\nMy first reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because capable on choicen activities that would like to take and enjoy. . Also you would be very stressed that you're in that class and that stress can affect other classes in a negative way.\\n\\nMy second reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because idf students choose to do more activities they gain more expirence in diffrent types catagories. The family and the student should know if they are capable to have many activities and still get their work done. They also might say they know more about time managment but some students are fast at doing homework and are very fast at studying. For example if the school choices classes that you dislike and not enjoy you would have to be stuck with it. For example if you have more activities you have a way better chance to find something you like than less activies.\\n\\nHowever, the school might say that if a student has more extracurricular activities it would affect the time students has for doing homework and studying. This is a good thing beause it allows students to test the waters and find out what thy like to do so they can think about studying in college and persuing it. That is why I believe the student should choose if they want to do many or little extracurricular activities. So I think that the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers\", 'Examples of successful individuals who eschewed traditional norms to find success include Mark Zuckerberg, who dropped out of Harvard University after launching Facebook, and J.K Rowling, who wrote her first Harry Potter novel while unemployed as a single mother. It is important to create a supportive environment that allows young people to openly explore different career paths and discover the one that is best suited for them.. \\n\\nResearch has shown that when students are left to their own explorations and interests after graduating high school, they create paths more suited to their natural abilities and strengths. \\n\\nWe live in a world where teenagers are pressured to decide their profession long before they can have a full understanding of the variety of occupational paths available to them. Such success stories demonstrate the incredible possibilities that can arise when students are given the freedom to pursue a personal career journey without feeling constrained by preset requirements.\\n\\nIn conclusion, pressuring teenagers to determine their career path before they have had the chance to explore other options may have negative consequences that can hinder their future prospects. Requiring high school students to identify their future career can lead to poor decision-making, unnecessary stress, and a lack of exploration of potential opportunities', 'Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits.. So, I think we can control our character traits. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet.\\n\\nAlso, another example is being social. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. I could\\'ve not yelled I could\\'ve just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social.\\n\\nTherefore, my next example is being a over yourself. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself.\\n\\nFinally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, \"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.\" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. Some people dont like those kind of people because they say \"there no fun\" or they are \"party poopers.\" I\\'ll confess that I was a little cocky and over confident when it came to sports because i was a very competitive kid. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. This is why I think we choose our character traits.\\n\\nFor example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. You have to balance it all out. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, \"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.\" Do we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control? I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. and even discover new things', 'Title: A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\\n\\nWhen most people think of cowboys, they imagine rugged individuals riding horses across wide open plains, herding cattle and protecting the land from outlaws and bandits. But what if we told you about a cowboy who didn\\'t just tame the land, but also conquered the vast, unpredictable ocean? That\\'s right, there was a cowboy who rode the waves.\\nHis name was Pancho Barnes, but he wasn\\'t just any ordinary cowboy. Born in 1901 in a small town in Texas, Barnes grew up in a world of cattle ranching and rodeo competitions. As a skilled rider and an adventurous spirit, Barnes quickly became known for his daring feats and his passion for horses. However, it was his love for flying airplanes that would eventually lead him to the world of aviation and ultimately, the waves.\\nIn 1928, Barnes moved to Los Angeles to pursue a career in aviation, which at that time was a male-dominated field. Despite the challenges, Barnes was determined to make her mark in the industry. As a skilled pilot and mechanic, she quickly became an expert in aircraft maintenance and repairs, which allowed her to work with some of the most renowned aviators of her time.\\nOne such aviator was Howard Hughes, a wealthy entrepreneur and aviation pioneer who would eventually become one of Barnes\\' closest friends. Together, they shared a passion for adventure and pushing the boundaries of what was possible in aviation. In 1930, Hughes introduced Barnes to the world of water-based aviation, when he took her for a flight in his seaplane, the H-1 Racer.\\nThe experience was life-changing for Barnes, who instantly fell in love with flying over water and the thrills that came with it. She quickly learned how to fly seaplanes and eventually purchased a boat, which she converted into a seaplane tender, allowing her to accompany pilots on their water-based adventures. Barnes\\' passion for water-based aviation grew so strong that she eventually started her very own flying school called the \"Hell\\'s Angels\" flying circus, where she taught pilots how to master the skies and the water.\\nAs the years passed, Barnes continued to break down barriers and push the limits of what was possible in aviation. She was the first woman to fly an experimental aircraft across the Atlantic Ocean and the first to fly solo across the Pacific. Her adventurous spirit and determination earned her the nickname \"Flying Cowgirl.\"\\nBut it was her love for the waves that truly set her apart from other aviators. Barnes became a skilled surfer, spending countless hours riding the waves on her surfboard. This unique combination of cowboy and surfer made her a legend among her peers and the aviation community, as she defied stereotypes and proved that a cowboy could not only tame the land but also conquer the waves.\\nPancho Barnes passed away in 1975 at the age of 74. Bu', \"Many people tend to use their cellular device while driving. There are many advertisements made to show how using these devices affect lives. Unfortunately, people still chose to use their phones, endangering those around them. Regardless of how many people know the cause and affect, no one cares until it is them that is affected. Drivers should not be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nIt is said that smartphones is a substantial and cause us to make very poor decisions.\\n\\nAll of us feel capable of being able to do two things at once but, using a phone while driving shouldn't be on that list. Using a calling phone while driving can decrease the driver's awareness on the road. Using it also can increase the driver's risk of causing a crash.\\n\\nFurthermore, using a cellular device while driving can increase death rates.\\n\\nAnother big reason drivers shouldn't be able to use cell phones in any capacity while operating a vehicle is because it is legal! Under some state laws, serious repeat offenders may even face jail time. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, punishments such as suspending a driver's license may be implemented by police. Even though there are jail penalties you can also get fined.\\n\\nUsing cellular devices while driving is dangerous. Even if the split-second you look away from the road doesn't cause the accident, someone else could cause it by doing the same thing.

Ultimately, it is important to understand that making a decisions on when to commit to a career is personal and should be made with thoughtful consideration and research.. \\n\\nUltimately, commitment to a career and deciding to follow a certain path is an individual choice and should be based on trust in one's own abilities. While committing to a career at a young age can have a positive impact, it is important to understand that not everyone is suited for committing to a career at such a young age. Further, there are examples of those who have decided to slow down their career pursuits and wait until later in life, achieving success in a different manner. \\nIn recent years, more and more young people are choosing to commit to a career at a very young age. Examples of successful people who committed to a career at a young age can be seen in individuals such as Mark Zuckerberg, who at the age of 19 founded the social networking site, Facebook. Those who commit to a career at a young age tend to have opportunities to gain experience and are able to focus more clearly on their career goals\", \"\\nIt is undeniable that technology has had a profoundly positive effect on people's lives in the modern era. We can now connect with people from across the world with the click of a button, allowing us to form relationships and gain knowledge on a global scale. \\n\\nTechnology has also played a key role in advancing medicine, science and engineering. We can now buy things online rather than take a trip to the store. We can even use technology to control our own homes, by automated lighting, climate control, and even security systems. \\n\\nAdditionally, technology has made everyday tasks simpler and more efficient. Technology has made activities such as communication and information gathering easier than ever before. We can stream movies and music without needing any physical media. The modern medical field is largely reliant on technology for diagnoses and treatments, and inventions such as the MRI scanner have been crucial in the advancement of medical science. Technology has also been integral in the development of technological innovations such as faster and more powerful computers, improved agricultural techniques, and better ways to harness renewable energy sources. \\n\\nUltimately, technology has had a largely positive effect on the lives of people across the world.

The electoral college may seem helpful in some ways in terms of voting, but not entirely. Think of it this way you vote for a specific candidate, but you are voting without knowing entirely whether your votes are making a difference because you have no control over whom the electors vote for. I believe this system should make modifications.\\n\\nOur county has already had many problems, and accusations of having a corrupt government. Hearing about the electoral college system, and the fact that as a nation we have almost no lower for who is elected, does not hell the case of being called \"corrupt\" or \"incorrect\". The people as a whole in the United States should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice, without worries. People who specifically vote for someone running for president should either be able to do it themselves, without having to vote for a slate of electors, or, the slate of electors should be more reliable. As in paragraph ten, we cannot always control who the electors cast their vote for. \"Can voters control whom their electors vote for? Not always.\" Either the electors need to be more reliable in carrying out the requests made by the people of the United States, or we must make modifications to possible change or all together cease use of the electoral college system.\\n\\nIn addition to the fact the American people do not have full control over who our electors vote for, we do not even have control over who our electors are.\\n\\nIn paragraph eleven, it states that \"legislatures are technically responsible for licking electors, and that those electors could always defy the will of the people.\" If you were truly in favor of protecting the rights given to the people of this country, you would notice this system is wrong. No control over our votes, and no control over the electors? Something must change.\\n\\nTake into consideration how our country is affected every time a new president is elected. Sometimes this effect is good, others not so much. The lobular vote should be able to decide who is elected for president because those who are voting will be effected greatly by the change in presidency. Popular vote means the vote cast the most, the vote submitted most, the vote a large majority presented. The lobular vote is always at risk of being defied, and there is nothing the common people of the United States can do about it. There is no action we can take to change the election. In paragraph 16 of the article, it states that \"Each party selects a slate of electors trusted to vote for the party\\'s nominee and that trust is rarely betrayed...\" Yes this trust may rarely be betrayed, but it is entirely possible. Just because it does not fallen often, does not mean it is impossible...and who knows? What if the trust is betrayed sometimes without our knowledge?\\n\\nFinally, unless I have not made it entirely clear, I am not in favor of the electoral college system. Trust can always be betrayed, even if it does not fallen often it can still fallen without our knowledge. The people residing in the United States and under the laws of our country do not have full control on who is elected as president. I am, however in favor of election by lobular vote. This means that a state casts its vote based on whom the majority has voted for, and I truly believe this would system would best suit our country.', 'The Facial Action Coding System can tell how someone is feeling by looking at there face or a painting of them. It showed how Mona Lisa was feeling just by looking ar her picture. Now that is pretty cool if you ask me.\\n\\nI think this technolgy in the classes room would work out so weel for students. Having a coputer that can tell when you are upset or happy or even bored is pretty cool. They talk about how it would sense when someone is bored and the computer would be able to chage whatever its going to someone or interesting for the student. That would help keep students focused on what there doing in a fun and cool way.\\n\\nIt would be an amazing idea to have a computer like that. i think this because fit he coputer can know hwen you bred and be able to fix that it would be great. More and more studensts would want to pay attenion. The computer would make it into something cool and insteresting for the student. That if could stop students from losing focus.\\n\\nI mean come on we have all been there when you really dont want to pay attention to somthing that doesnt spark your insterst. Students would guess there way out of the work because it would be do boring for them. They wouldnt try which ends up bad for everyone but mostly students.\\n\\nThere are some tihns that could become a probelm though. Like the computers cant hold up all that imfornation on to one small computer. Also schools would have to pay about of money just to give them out to the students. And it would cause about more money to make it the conputers. Some parents may even think there child is being watched and that it might not be safe. There are so man thing that will have to thouhgt of and talked about . That maybe it is best just to keep things the way they are.\\n\\nOne last reason why i think it would be a good idea to have these in school is because teachers will beable to understand there students a little more. getting to know how they are feeling about things. When a teahcer finds out there student isnt doing there best they can do a better job and make suree they are doing everthing they can to help.\\n\\nAlthought this is a very great technology there are many bumps thy will need to look at. And right now may not be the best time but way down in the futue i hope someone can make it happen. I think it will work really well with students and help them much better. If they do make them out for everyone.

It is important to stay informed, patient and have the courage to seek help when needed.. This can include engaging in activities you enjoy or reaching out to your support network. It is important to be patient and actively listen as listening to the person you are caring for is one of the most important elements of care. Caring for someone with mental illness can be emotionally and physically demanding; it is essential to practice self-care. \\n\\nCaring for someone with mental health issues is an incredibly rewarding yet challenging journey. Additionally, have a good understanding of available resources and treatment options, such as therapy, medication, self-help techniques, and other forms of support. \\nCaring for someone with mental health issues can be a huge challenge. As a carer, you should be aware that mental health can fluctuate from good to bad days, and you may have to adjust your approach accordingly. \\n\\nIt is also important to take care of yourself.

College offers a valuable education, along with the opportunity to develop interpersonal skills, hone critical thinking and problem solving abilities, and grow academically and socially. \\n\\nIn the end, graduating high school in three years provides the groundwork for a successful college and career journey afterwards. It provides an opportunity to fast track courses, save money on tuition, and to be professionally successful. It allows for an expansive education and access to a wealth of resources that can help students as they progress in their studies and into the workplace.. This means earlier access to post-graduate studies and potential career opportunities. College also provides access to a wide range of potential internships and networking opportunities that can help a student to pursue a career in their chosen field and grow their career as a professional. \\nGraduating high school after only three years instead of the traditional four can be beneficial in many ways. Such a program can foster a student's intellectual curiosity and further a high-level of learning. The accelerated program allows students to start university earlier and to graduate college in four short years, instead of the traditional five. \\n\\nOverall, graduating high school early and pursuing a college degree afterwards is a beneficial career path\", \". One of the reason why I believe that should be allowed is because cellphones are very useful and helpful for me in many ways. Teachers also say that students will be texting in class and some of them playing video games and then when they tell them to put their cellphones away, they do not obey and some of them insult the teacher. It would be helpful for students to find any kind of information on internet when they forget their computers or other devices that they might use as a resource to find information. Then they start to use it in some sentences to challenge themselves and improve their English. Some of this students also will help them to find whatever meaning of a word that they do not understand. Most of the population have shown that a big percent of the population use their cellphones to spend their time in social media, whether is Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram. Another reason is that students will have the advantage to use their cellphones while they are in the middle of the class, and it means that those schools trust students that they use their cellphones properly during class and they are proving to others schools that student can be trusted to use their cellphones during classes. Another percent of the population spend their time in YouTube which that YouTube brings us some advantage and disadvantage. For some students will be annoying to have cellphones in class because it is going to be a distraction even if they are not using their cellphones.\\n\\nFrom other perspective teachers might believe that is wrong to have cellphones in class, whether they are using it in a proper way or not because they might believe that it's a distraction for every students, and even if they are good students they will use their cellphones while teachers are explaining some important information. The disadvantage might be that people might spend too much time watching video games or a new episodes from their favorite comics characters. There are going to be some students who speak different language as their first language and it is very helpful to have cellphone while they are in school. I also see how teachers get mad when a student do not obey when they have to put their cellphones away, and then the student start to argue with the teacher. The advantage might be the tutorials that can help us to find information, how to fix something that you are capable to repair, and how to provide some skills from something that you like. Those students who agree to have cellphones in school and do not accomplish the rules in how to use their cellphones properly, they will be playing around while they are in class, listen to music, and probably they will be texting with their friends. I strongly agree that school should allow students to have cellphones because it does provide a lot of advantages. They also believe that some of them will use their cellphones to finish homework that is not for their class and will cause that students will not be paying attention in what the teacher is saying. For those who use their cellphones in a properly way will say that cellphones are going to help them more than what teachers expect. For example some of the students who speak Spanish and they do not understand what the word say, they directly go to their cellphones and translate the word. Students also can give an example to other students that cellphones are little machines that help us in everyday lives, and they also might be giving advice to students in how they can be benefited from chance that the school provides to them.\\n\\nOn the other side why cellphones should not be allowed in schools is because schools think that students will not use their cellphones in a right path, and they will become more addictive to their cellphones where social media it's included. I also use my cellphone when I do not have my computer with me, and I do my classwork with my cellphone, and then I turn my work in. Cellphones should be allowed because that might help students to communicate with their parents if they have any kind of emergency while they are in school. But some students do not understand when they have to use their cellphones and when I see students listening to music it does distracted me because I am trying to concentrate in what the teachers is explaining because If I don not pay attention it is hard to understand later on. In my situation I speak Spanish as my first language and when I do not understand a word I go to my cellphone and I translate the word and then I try to understand what the word means. Another reason to not use cellphones in school is because when there is a fight between two students, they start to take pictures or videos of the fight rather than prevent and called anyone who can help.\\n\\nMost of the student will agree to have cellphones in schools because some of them use their cellphones in a right path and some of them do not. Some teacher do not bother them if a student have a cellphone or not because they think that as long the student is doing his homework and classwork, they are going to be fine.\\n\\nI believe cellphones should be allowed in schools, but under supervision of the teachers and principles\", '                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             .

After some reflection on my own life, I have come to agree with Winston Churchill’s quote, “Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm”. After months of hard work and dedication, I finally got the job I wanted.\\n\\nThis experience taught me the importance of keeping enthusiasm in the face of failure. From this experience, I have learned to never settle — no matter how many times I fail. \\nLiving a life of meaning and fulfillment means learning from our failures and embracing every experience with enthusiasm. After analyzing what went wrong in the application process, I applied to more positions and kept my enthusiasm up by challenging myself with new experiences. Although I was aware of the possibility of rejection, the actual experience was incredibly disheartening. I have also learned to evaluate why I failed and use it as an opportunity to grow. Despite learning important skills in the university and preparing extensively, I was rejected from the position I wanted the most. Even when I fail, I always try to dust myself off and keep pushing forward with enthusiasm and an open mindset. However, instead of letting it dampen my spirits, I chose to use it as a learning opportunity', 'A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\\n\\nAn example of this statement are babies starting to walk. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it.\\n\\nAnother reason why Emerson\\'s quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something you\\'ve neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.\\n\\nIn contrast of Emerson\\'s quote, if people keep practicing, but they don\\'t seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it\\'s still true today. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Another experience I had was in elementary school. My family was impressed at how much I\\'ve eatan. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.\\n\\nAs Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you\\'ve never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. Some people think that when they master at something they\\'ve never mastered at, then they will grow up. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. It was scary at first, but overtime, I\\'ve been continually practicing using these tools, and now I\\'m an expert at using these equipments. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future', \"Steven Spielberg was turned down by the University of Southern California’s film school three times, and was rejected from Universal Studios numerous times before making his first feature-length film. \\n\\nSimilarly, the film industry is filled with stories of those who found success after a history of failure. \\n\\nTake, for example, Thomas Edison's lightbulb. Edison famously said, “I have not failed. Failure is essential to success because it helps us to develop skills, to learn resilience, and to become better problem-solvers. \\nWinston Churchill once famously stated, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” Churchill's words provide a great reminder of the importance of failure in achieving success. Had he given up at the first few attempts of failure, he would have never created the lightbulb, one of the most significant scientific discoveries of the late 19th century. \\n\\nThese examples demonstrate that Churchill's statement holds true: it is only through the courage to continue, even in the face of failure, that success can be achieved.. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” After thousands of trials and errors, Edison eventually achieved success\", 'This can inspire others to give back to their own community, benefiting society at large.\\n\\nUltimately, displaying positive qualities in our behavior and actions can have a ripple effect in our communities for the better. Through my actions, I am demonstrating how important it is to help others. \\nWhen we show positive qualities such as kindness, empathy, and respect through our behavior and actions, we can have a powerful influence on the people around us. By modeling these qualities ourselves, we give others permission to do the same. Through our action, we can have the power to shape the lives of those around us in profound ways..  \\n\\nAnother example is volunteering in my local community. If I showed them respect, our interactions were much calmer and more constructive.  \\n\\nFor example, I remember growing up with my siblings. This taught them to show respect to others and resulted in healthier relationships with our peers', 'By properly harnessing the sense of motivation and diversity created in the group, students can more effectively reach their learning goals.. \\n\\nDespite these challenges, group work can still be beneficial for students. Furthermore, the collective effort can boost motivation and help to ensure that projects are completed in a timely fashion. Group members may not have the same commitment level or work ethic, which can result in project delays, task imbalances, and conflict. Additionally, strong group dynamics can help foster creativity and encourage diverse perspectives when discussing a problem.\\n\\nHowever, working in a group also has several drawbacks. There are several advantages to working in a group. \\nWorking in a group can be a great way for students to connect, communicate, and collaborate on school projects. Additionally, it can be difficult to make everyone feel included and heard, especially when there are a diverse range of personalities in the group. Working in a group on school projects can help students gain a better understanding of the subject by providing multiple perspectives and opportunities for collaboration. People in a group can draw on the skills and knowledge of multiple people to reach a solution or understanding', 'When we fail, we learn from our mistakes and persevere in finding ways to succeed. Alongside taking chances and learning from our mistakes, enthusiasm also plays an essential role in our success. Without taking risks, we would never reach our goals and be able to fully achieve our potential. Being passionate and driven motivates us to stay focused and empowered. \\nFailure is a natural part of the pursuit of success. By understanding that failure is a necessary part of success and embracing our enthusiasm, we can reach our goals and be successful.. We should be excited and inspired by our goals, and cultivate a positive attitude and proactive approach to work towards achieving them.

We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms.\\n\\nFirst the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. May be some people will disagree with me.              . So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. We costantly surfing the social media. Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said.\" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement.\" I agree with the statement of Enderson. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.\\n\\nIn conclution I must said that I agree with Enderson\\'s quote \" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement.\" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We want to know what others think about us. We can\\'t just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty.\\n\\nSo we can leave a better future for our childrens.

The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.\\n\\nMy first reason that support my response, is that if you don\\'t keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don\\'t stop focused on it will make your life easier. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself.\\n\\nMy third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.\\n\\nTo conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson\\'s statement. The experience you have will make your future better. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don\\'t stop focused on, it will make you grow. For example, some people have their goals but they don\\'t try their best.\\n\\nMy second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\".\\n\\nIn my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. The more you know about something, the best future you will have', 'Over the years cars have become a necessity in first world countries, they are used every day and a lot of people wouldn\\'t even have a job if it was not for cars. Although these new innovations in technology are overly useful they would not be used in excess because they could damage our environment, save people money, and even make people stressed.\\n\\nCars are one of the main pollutants in the earth. As a mater of fact the first world countries are trying to convince the less developed countries to use less cars because of all the damage they have already caused. Accroding to source 2 \"after days of solution Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city\" here you can clearly see how much of an impact cars have on the environment. What is also interesting is that just after five days the smog cleared enough for the \"french party to remind the ban for odd numbered plated\" although it isn\\'t a good thing that the French did not keep this law, it is astonishing to see how just limiting cars has such a good effect on the environment another reason why people shouldn\\'t use cars so often is because they are very expensive to maintain. Many Americans spend a large portion of their income filling their cars\\' gas thanks. Surprizingly according to source 4 Americans are no longer being as many cars due to the recession. This just proves the point that cars generate so much expense that almost every day Americans can\\'t even afford one. If people drove there cars less there would be a significant increase in the amount of money they gain each month.', \"Additionally if you do not have a self-identity people will not remember who you are. Secondly if you always have people telling you the answers in life it is hard to live without those people who helped you in the first place. Another reason would be that people might think you are unable to do simple tasks in life because you relay on other people too much. People should make their own decisions because relying on others will make you less self-sufficient and you should develop your own self-identity not from the choices of other people, although some people may say that people who seek guidance from experts are smarter than people who do not.\\n\\nPeople should be able to rely on their own decisions on life, so that they do not become less self-sufficient in the choices that they make. People should be inclined to make their own decisions in life whether they like it or not.. This may be true but it's better to find the answer on your own than to always ask for help from experts.\\n\\nIn the end you shouldn't rely on other people too much because it will be harder to be more self-sufficient and it will be harder to develop your own self-identity. I highly doubt that Tesla or Einstein relayed on anyone if not no one on the work that they did. That people who seek out help will be more informed in life, therefore they do not have to worry about the things they do not know. Firstly if you keep relying on others than you become someone who can not do anything on their own without the help of other people. You should always listen to your brain and not seek out help too much, or it will affect your life in very bad ways\\n\\nStill, some may say that people who seek help from experts are smarter than people who do not. How people live their life is up to them whether to follow their own decisions, or seek guidance from experts and authorities for life's important matters. Your past choices defines who are you today, so if you relay on others too much than you become a different kind of person you once were\\n\\nOther people who spend their whole life heavily relaying on other people develop no self-identity of their own. Finally always become a person who does not have to relay on others for the sake of your own well being. Lastly self-sufficiently is an important skill that everyone should have through-out their life\", 'Working with a partner on school projects and assignments can be extremely beneficial for a variety of reasons. For starters, it alleviates the amount of work anyone individual has to do and provides an opportunity for division of labor.

At the same time, schools should consider budget implications of hiring additional staff and the logistical implications of providing transportation for later hours. \\n\\nA two-hour longer school day, however, could also have a few drawbacks. Schools could offer a wider variety of courses and extra-curricular activities, having access to more resources and training for teachers. \\n\\nOverall, while there is a lot of potential for a two-hour longer school day to be beneficial for students and schools, there are also potential drawbacks such as fatigue, financial implications, and logistical challenges that must be taken into consideration.. Having two extra hours every day would mean more time to complete difficult topics or extra-curricular activities such as sports, music, or art. \\n\\nFor schools, an extended school day provides a great opportunity to provide students with more valuable learning experiences.

But for some students, science experiments can be intimidating and can lead to a negative outlook on science and the laboratory. Far from simply studying the facts of science, science experiments can allow students to understand and appreciate scientific relationships in a deeper way. Not only do students gain hands-on knowledge of varying scientific concepts, but they also discover how to use scientific techniques to reach a goal. Not only can science enrich a student's intellectual capacity but also their school experience. Through careful observation and precise measurements, students can gain greater awareness of the scientific process. It's essential for students to remember to follow safety rules and protocols in order to get the most out of their experiments. \\nCompleting science experiments in school can be an engaging and educational experience\", '\\n\\nIt is essential for students to be able to use their scarce free time to pursue interests, goals, and relationships, that allow them to have life experiences and develop a better understanding of the world. The lack of available time for leisure activities, relationships, and sports could result in disinterest in school and a reduced capacity to learn. \\n\\nIn conclusion, adding an extra one and a half hours of school could have serious detrimental effects on the lives of students, both academically and socially. \\nTaking an extra one and a half hours per school day would have many pitfalls that students and parents must consider. With such a long school day, students, especially young ones, would be walking home in the dark, which poses serious risks to their safety. Furthermore, the strain of the significantly longer day could cause students to become disinterested in school, which could result in higher dropout rates. On top of that, students would be robbed of additional time spent with friends, family, and exploring personal hobbies or leisure activities. The lack of available time after school significantly reduces these important opportunities. Furthermore, students may not have enough time and energy to participate in sports teams or practice instruments, which can lead to disinterest in their academic career. Therefore, despite the potential benefits of having a longer school day, the drawbacks are simply too great.', 'You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home.

When doing a task you are given you normally have a prey good idea of what is going on and the direction you want to go. Big, IQ never hires to hear the opinions of others because they may have a great idea you never would have high of. This will only benefit you and can help you improve what you are working on in the figure.\\n\\nThis is why companies hire many workers because having more people brings in new ideas and more high process on things they are working on and trying to accomplish. For example the president doesn is work by himself, he has many people to give him ideas and ask what needs to be done. These people are the Vice President and his cabinet and within them the president would have to do everything by him self. Another reason IQ may be good to GEQ opinions from others is so that things may be less sided. For example in or country the legislative branch is a bipolar form of congress meaning that their are two houses. The House of Representatives and the Senate. No law can be passed if IQ doesn GEQ a majority in both of them. This sees things IP so that many people want that law to be passed so IQ benefits any people. The same thing goes for a project or a paper. Asking others what they think will give more ideas and other views or opinions that may be better than the current ones you have so that you can GEQ more thing accomplished, and lead to other great ideas in the figure.\\n\\nHave you ever high of how the telephone, the lightbulb, FHA car and many other revolutionary inventions have been created? Do you think somebody is woke IP one morning, had some bacon and made those? The answer is no. IQ makes a long time with many opinions and ideas to create great inventions such as those. For example the creator of the lightbulb Thomas Edison saw that many were working on the lightbulb big could not find Mich success. Big Thomas Edison did because even high he himself was a genius he looked a what others were doing, and what others had done in the pass, Used some of their ideas that had some success and along with some help from one of his Coworkers he created the lightbulb which completely changed the world forever. After that others looked a his sicced and kept improving IQ to the lightbulb we all Is today. The same thing then happened with the creator of the telephone. He and his coworker worked with Exchequer and gave their best ideas as to what they high would work best and tested IQ many times. After working hard for a long time of working together and improving iq finally worked. After many revisions from others of the original one we have the phone that many Americans have in their pockets today that you no longer need to have hooked into a wall in order to call someone. You can be wherever you want, whenever you want to call somebody and HQ is daily amazing. This would not be possible high within the options and ideas of many others. So why not is ask someone for help?\\n\\nIQ doesn make very long to go ask a parent or call a friend IP and ask for them to read and revise a paper or assignment you have. For example their have been many times where I am done with a paper big within the help from somebody else I have simmered IQ and later found oil that their were many errors or things I could have done better on in the paper. This impacted my grade and could have been resolved if I had is gone downstairs to ask my dad to make 10 minutes to read over IQ. My father is also a more experienced writer than I am so IQ helped to have him revise my paper. I also learned what and what not to do in my writing in the figure which has helped me greatly. Now I continue to have someone look over my work because IQ doesn hire me to have another person looking over IQ and can on benefit me and give me new ideas. I then Is those ideas and keep building on them like the greatest inventors and leaders have to keep improving my writing and other assignments that I need to do.\\n\\nEven the smartest of Is like the President and Thomas Edison have someone that helps and gives them a second opinion so why shouldn you? So next time you go to IRN in a paper for English class is make a second and ask somebody to help you oil. IQ has benefited me in school and inside of school and I know IQ will help you as well.

Imagination is essential to giving us the ideas and visions that can shape our lives, but it is knowledge that gives us the capacity to carry out those ideas. Knowledge of the world around us and the various systems at work in society gives us the power to turn creative ideas into tangible plans of action.\\n\\nThe ability to effectively utilize knowledge also gives us the capacity to identify risks and think ahead. \\nKnowledge is often referred to as the key to success, and it’s true – knowledge can open many doors, giving us access to unique opportunities in life. While imagination can be important in coming up with creative ideas, knowledge is the essential ingredient in taking action on those ideas. Thus, without knowledge, our dreams will remain just that – dreams. It is knowledge that allows us to make decisions, solve complex problems and develop plans of action.\\n\\nImagination allows us to visualize possibilities and dream up creative solutions to problems, but this is only the first half of success. Knowledge is thus a fundamental tool for growth and success.\\n\\nIn the end, we can see why knowledge is more important than imagination. Only when combined with knowledge can our ideas become reality.', \"It is very easy for someone to change their character, whatever you choose to be that will be your character. Everyone chooses their own character no matter if you are small or big. If a person has a job interview and he wants to look good then he has to wear a dress that fits his character and makes him that he wants the job. Some people dont have a good character and that's why people neither wants to trust them or talk to them. A few years ago my uncle was invited to a wedding party but he wasn't sure what to wear, however some some of his friend told him to wear something casual but that didn't fit his character because he was a boss of a company, therefor many of his coworker would see him there so he decided to wear a suit because it was best for his character.\\n\\nWe choose our own character by the way how we talk to other people. Having a good character shows that you are a good person, but if you decide to have a bad character people no longer will trust you and you will be worthless to others, so this is why we choose our own character.\\n\\nWe choose our own character because our character is based on how we interact with other people. Even in the movie no one likes the the bad character because they are mean, bad, and no good to others but to harm them and put them in danger. people can present themselves as neat person by the way how they dress in public or anywhere else.                           . A coworker of mine was very rude to customers. All a person has to do to have a nice character they have to dress properly they need to have good manners and don't be rude to others and this is all it takes to have a good character. Having a good character is very important in our everyday life, furthermore having a good personality will also effect a persons character so in order to have a better character you need to have a good personality.\\n\\nSome people say that we can't choose our character because it's beyond our control, however choosing your character is not hard you just need to have a good personality and have to be nice to others. Being nice and respecting others will represent a good character of you. Most people that we don't know how to choose our character traits, therefor choosing a good character do not need any special skills. A persons character is based on their personality. For example if my brother speaks to others in a good manner people will always respect him. Other people may say its hard for us to choose our character traits because we are not able to, however for some people it's hard but the things that a person does in their everyday life those things chooses their character it determines if they have a good character or not. He was always mad therefor no other employees wanted to talk to him. Its easy for people to choose a character for themselves either a good or a bad character. One day a customer complained to the manager about how he was being rude to her, so the manager decided to fire him from his job.\\n\\nWe choose our character based on how we dress\", \"Generations of families have shared recipes for traditional dishes that are still enjoyed today, and the many restaurants offer something for every palate.

When we don’t believe in ourselves, we may doubt our potential and give up on our ambitions. For example, an aspiring author may be confident in their abilities to write a book, even if they don’t have any published works yet. It is the all-important catalyst that helps us to move forward with our goals, despite the odds. With self-confidence, we can stay motivated and persevere in the pursuit of our goals. This raises the question of whether having self-confidence before achieving a goal or experience is necessary for our success.\\n\\nI believe that having self-confidence is the first step of all achievers, big or small. Without it, we may lack the necessary drive to see our aspirations through.. \\nConfidence is an important factor when it comes to achieving anything—whether it is in our personal or professional lives', 'Whether traveling in a group led by a tour guide is the best way to travel depends on the traveler.

As you already know the process of the Electoral College consists of electors meeting and voting for the president and vice president. Therefore, the people voting only help choose the state's electors when voting for their president. In reality, we all know that when we vote we are actually choosing our candidate's electors. Because of this the people feel like their voice isn't being heard. They believe that they aren't actually voting for their president.\\n\\nFor starters, the majority of people, over 60 percent of the voters, would prefer a direct election instead of having an Electoral College. Under the system we have now voters can't always control who their electors vote for. Sometimes there is a problem where we choose the wrong elector and in turn vote for the incorrect candidate. The majority of people voting feel that their vote does not really count because electors can go against what they promised, and they can vote for whomever they wanted to vote for.\\n\\nIn addition to this, there is a problem if there is a tie in the electoral votes. In the event of this the election would be passed to the House of Representatives. This means that it is up to state delegations to vote on the president.  \", \"I think that students have reason of thougtht that is this is an achievement not is easy we have a achievement yes we have a achievement in this life because yes not have an achievement I do know that you thought in my opinion the trues is the point number firts in this life because that is really happened the true is import always me question for me is that yes not have true all away different.\\n\\nSome things of this paragraph elieve o this prompt is that understand that the students they believe that students must be self confident and that sense have this world power CONFIDENT are two world confident and confidence Confident is feeling or showing that your are sure about your own abilities opcions and confidence is trust or stong belief in someone or something.

With good enthusiasm, leads to a good path and positive mindset. People also don't care at all. Positive attitudes will help a lot. For example, people that have negative attitudes can lead to bad mindsets, we don't want that from you, unless you want that. Yes, I agree with Prime Minister Churchill with this statement, it all adds up. It isn't easy but it is worth the weight on your life.\\n\\nFailure is a big word, so is success. Failure teaches most people lessons. Although, failure can also bring success, if you move smart. you can live you're best life and still fail at times. In life, their is ups and downs. Failure is part of life is my point\", \"Dear Senator,\\n\\nI am writing to you today to express my strong support for abolishing the Electoral College and electing the president by popular vote. I believe that the Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that no longer serves the interests of the American people.\\n\\nThe Electoral College was created over 200 years ago, and it was based on the idea that the president should be elected by a group of electors who would be wise and knowledgeable enough to make the best decision for the country. However, this system is no longer necessary, and it is actually harmful to our democracy.\\n\\nThe Electoral College gives more power to voters in small states than voters in large states. This is because each state has a number of electoral votes equal to its number of representatives and senators in Congress. So, a voter in a small state like Wyoming has more than three times the voting power of a voter in a large state like California.\\n\\nThis system is unfair, and it disenfranchises millions of voters. In the 2016 election, for example, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by over 3 million votes, but she lost the election because she lost the Electoral College. This means that millions of people who voted for Clinton had their votes effectively thrown away.\\n\\nThe Electoral College also encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a few swing states, and it leaves most states out of the process. This is because a candidate can win the presidency by winning the Electoral College even if they lose the popular vote. So, candidates have no incentive to campaign in states that are already considered to be safe for one party or the other.\\n\\nThis system is bad for democracy, and it's bad for the country. It's time for us to abolish the Electoral College and elect the president by popular vote. This is the fairest and most democratic way to choose our president, and it's the way that most Americans want.\\n\\nThank you for your time and consideration.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\n[Your Name]\", 'Also technology had negative effects on people\\'s lives, if the people used technology for ban things. technology increase each years because put new cellphone computer or other things like that. Second, technology is very important for some people because some need for job, communicates, homework, play online or other things. In conclusion, technology has positive and negative effects on people\\'s lives.. Now is more easy to do things like; pay in online, reading book, communicates or other things now can do. Now the company have good money because all people have cellphone or computer and the cellphone year to year they more expensive to buy. Also, the technology sometimes can had negatives effects on people\\'s lives because some people do ban things with technology for examples, cyber bullying, steal ID form other person, or to trick the young person. So technology can be has positive effects on people\\'s live, if the people can be use right the technology. My Mom and my Dad say \" in the past was hard to communicates because did\\'t have technology (telephone,table,or computer) so before use letter to communicate with other person, but to take long time. Technology allows to the people, technology they has positive or negative effects on people\\'s lives. First, technology is a systematic treatment of application of Knowles esp. Now is more easy to communicate because the people have cellphone.\\n\\nNow the time chances because technology increase more better and more easy to do things. Finally, technology is good for communicates with other people that lives far away or other country.\\n\\nFurthermore technology had good benefit for the people life and essential for young person, but no all people usable good for example, the young uses sometime only for play game or post ban things in social minded. Sometime technology can be effects people because when the other people used social minded for make bullying to other person, this person can be effects emotionally.\\n\\nIn the past does not have technology; so was hard for communicates with other people, buy things from other country, or for to looking things for homework. Third, some people uses the technology for good things like \" people can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.\" This explains the technology is good and promote more easy lives of the people', 'Additionally, it can be difficult to have meaningful discussions with classmates over the internet, which can limit opportunities for critical thinking and collaboration. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult to build a sense of community within the classroom, which can be beneficial to many students. Furthermore, not taking notes can also have a negative effect on learning, as it is critical for students to capture all relevant information and ideas from the lecture to be able to process it later. If students are unable to stay focused and take notes, they may not get the full educational experience that is available in an in-person setting. This can cause students to miss important points and comprehension of the material being discussed. \\n\\nOverall, while online classes have the potential to provide students with convenience and flexibility when it comes to their education, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks as well. \\n\\nWhile online classes offer the convenience of being able to access course materials and lectures without having to attend in-person classes, they can also have some disadvantages for students. One of the biggest challenges with virtual learning is that it is easy to get distracted and not pay attention for the duration of the lecture. Consequently, online classes may not be a beneficial choice for all students.. Furthermore, the lack of face-to-face interaction can make it more difficult for students to build meaningful connections. \\n\\nOnline classes can be difficult for some students because of the self-discipline that is required in order to effectively learn and retain information', 'But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. Summer is one of the greates time for students, many students go to new places, to visit old family menbers and pass time whit them. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. What educators don\\'t see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students who\\'s choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school.\\n\\nOn the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times don\\'t remenber thing that I sow the year before. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig.\\n\\nIn conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year.\\n\\nSummer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. It can sound exagerate but that wouldn\\'t be much time to us for do our sumer change.\\n\\nFirst of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the \"suffer\" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I couln\\'t do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us would\\'t provide the same amount of aventures.\\n\\nMore over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldn\\'t make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. I beliebe that we things shouldn\\'t change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it.. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the one\\'s who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more', \"So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. Also if you need help don't hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. That's the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job.\\n\\nThe second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don't get stressed out too much. The more you ask for help the less you'll be stressed. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. On september 2, 2015 Generic_Name was entering his first year of high school, and already knew what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what kind of doctor he wanted to be. Also, so they don't get too stressed out for it.\\n\\nIf you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, don't even have a plan, and would just be stressed out.\\n\\nIn conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. If you know what you want to do then you'll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you won't have to take extra classes for no reason. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of.             . In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school.\\n\\nThe first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. That's the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don't get stressed out too much.\\n\\nSome people would disagree with me because they think it's ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon\", 'More schools , classes are making it easier to access assignments that can be completed online ,\\n\\nyou can view what assignments you have to complete in class by using your cellphone instead of being overwhelmed with paperwork , your tasks can be completed online.\\n\\nI believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms , it will make learning in class easier due to the easy access of the internet , in case of family emergencys and for any other reason you might need it. In case of a family emergency , parents , relatives will call you on your phone most likely they will not call the school. I have had personal experiences with that as my parents do not contact the school when they wish to speak to me , they call me on my cell phone.\\n\\nImplementing better rules in school for cellphone usage is beneficial , instead of punishing a student for having there phone out in the classroom the school should make better use out of cellphones by allowing students to have them out and or use them. I believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms because , If someone needs to call you , family emergency , and it could also be used as learning tool.\\n\\nAlthough sometimes cell phones in school might be used for personal reasons like soical media the pros of being able to use your cell phones in school outweigh the cons. It is much easier to call someone during school on there celluar device instead of having to call the school wait for the school to find the classroom the student is in and then transfer the call to the student in that classroom. In todays current society millions of people use electronic devices at work and school , Schools should implement more use out of technology and let kids use their phones in class to help complete tasks assigned to them ,\\n\\nfor example , If a kid does not want to use a dictionary and to find a word he can easily just look up the words meaning on he internet using his phone.\\n\\nIf someone needs to call you during school they can easily do it by just dialing up your number instead of having to call the school. Cellphones are in alot of students lives and we should punish them for having todays technology in classrooms.', 'I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast. Failures can cause a lot of things like, feel hopeless, loss enthusiasm and giving up so easy for those who are weak, but if you are strong enough to believe that you are going to make it you will make it, you are going to have your levels of hope, enthusiasm and faith high that nothing will stop you to succeed.\\n\\nFailures are more challenges added to your life, to be in the top of the mountain you should hike until you can see the ocean behind the mountain. Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself \"You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you\". Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.\\n\\nMore than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. I think that success, are composed by failures, but not for everyone.\\n\\nSuccess are for a better life, but to have a better life there will be always complicated things(FAILURES), that may be you will want to stop doing that thing that is going to help you to succeed.\\n\\nThe important role of failures on success is that, if you don\\'t fail once you will not learn; failures plays that important part in success, learn is based on what you did wrong, I am saying based on wrong because If you did something wrong before, you learn that part, What do you did wrong? and next in the future you already know what you did wrong and now you will make it right.\\n\\nNow, sometimes we give up so easy on what we want or on what we are fighting for, some loss the enthusiasm for the success and others not, I agree with that, some think different and if you think different about the failures its going to help you to make that success. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.\\n\\nSome people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain.

Similarly, if a person pursues a goal to become healthier and meets that goal, they can be filled with an inner sense of pride, self-satisfaction, and enhanced self-worth. For instance, if an individual sets a goal to finish a book and perseveres to the end of the project, they can feel a sense of accomplishment from having completed the task. However, self-esteem from achieving goals leaves a lasting impression that can be accessed even when no outside praise is available.. \\n\\nThese feelings of increased self-esteem from goal achievement are different from the sense of self-worth that comes from praise. Achieving goals can give us a sense of accomplishment, a powerful boost to our confidence, and a feeling of increased pride in ourselves. \\nBuilding self-esteem by accomplishing goals can have powerful and long-lasting effects', 'Attending classes from home online or by video conference has many potential benefits. For example, it eliminates the need for students to physically attend a class on campus, saving time and money associated With traveling and living on campus. It also gives students more flexibility, as lectures and course materials can be accessed and reviewed at any time, rather than conforming to the constraints imposed by physical class schedules. \\n\\nHowever, online or video conference classes come With some limitations. For one, it can be more difficult to stay engaged and attentive Then classes are held in a nontraditional environment. Additionally, students may find it more difficult to connect and collaborate With peers, as there is no facetoface interaction.\\n\\nOverall, I believe that classes from home online or by video conference should be available for all students. Even though there are some minor drawbacks, the convenience of being able to access classes on their ODN schedule and in their ODN space makes this an ideal option for students Who Want to take advantage of the latest educational opportunities.', '\\nWith the implementation of a four-day school week, the conservation of energy and resources could be significantly enhanced. The extra two hours added to the school day could be used to provide additional instruction and educational activities, which might lead to a more efficient use of resources and energy. Ultimately, the potential benefits of a four-day school week must be weighed carefully against the consequences for students with part-time jobs.. While the additional day off could give a student more time to pursue an after-school job, it could also result in fewer hours and less pay due to the extended school day. Furthermore, costs associated with transportation, such as gas and tolls, and food could be reduced as schools would only be open for four days each week.\\n\\nHowever, it is important to consider the potential drawbacks of a four-day school week, particularly for students with part-time jobs', 'It has also enabled them to save time and money and make purchases from the comfort of their own homes. Online job applications have enabled people to more easily search for and apply to desired job openings. With the rise of the digital age, individuals and society have been able to benefit from advances in technology in a variety of ways. \\nTechnology has revolutionized the way we live and interact. Another advantage of technology is its ability to facilitate communication. Similarly, online shopping has given people access to a wider variety of goods than ever before. All in all, technology has had an undeniable positive impact on both individuals and society as a whole.. Cell phones, emails, and video conferencing have allowed people to stay connected with each other, no matter where they are located', 'Dear State Senator,\\n\\nI think that our presidents should be chosen by popular vote because they have better chances of winning, and they will know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States.\\n\\nThe president\\'s have better chances of winning because they can have the most votes and wouldn\\'t have to wait on the Electoral College. Such as paragraph 9 says, \"Thanks to the quirks of the electoral college-won the popular vote but lost the presidency, over 60 percent of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.\" I think that was unfair because Al Gore could have been the president, but instead he was not, after all the campaigning he did to get those voters to vote for him, it ended up as a waste because the voting didn\\'t get him anywhere. If I was a president I would be highly upset because I knew I could have a big chance of losing just because of the Electoral College. What doesn\\'t make any sense to me is that the voters are not voting for the president but are voting for a slate of electors? What\\'s the whole point of voting then? People are out here voting for electors that they don\\'t even know and most of the electors are people who not holding public office. In paragraph 13 it says, \"During the 2000 campaign, seventeen states didn\\'t see the candidates at all, including Rhode Island and South Carolina, and voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn\\'t get to see a single campaign ad.\" To me, they are cheating people out of their votes, people vote for the one that they think could make a change not just voting to be voting.\\n\\nThe president would know how many people agree with what they are trying to do in the United States. The electoral college votes won\\'t help them know who is really for them and who\\'s not because if someone wins over electoral votes there are going to be people out there mad about the fact that they had won. This will make people not want to vote at all because 9 times out of 10 the person they are voting for gone lose. The electoral college just makes it difficult for the people that are running for president. I\\'m not saying that it should be easy to just become something big, but if you worked hard enough I think that you should be honored enough to become president through popular votes. This will make the incoming president feel appreciated for all the hard work they did to receive all these votes. They will know that what they are trying to set forward is good for some people and not just for them. Such as paragraph 12 says, \"Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote.\" What would happen then? That\\'s why you should just give it to the person with the most votes because they deserve it.\\n\\nI hope what I have really proved my argument that we should change the way a president is chosen, so it can be fair to everyone. I think this will make the incoming president feel confident in himself to make this happen.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME ', \"We make new character and be are selves.

She teaches Spanish I think so she travels for sure\", \"Student-designed summer projects are the way to ensure continued learning over their own summer break. When dealing with summer projects they are often described as tedious, inconvenient, and boring. Due to that assumption, summer projects are rarely completed throughout the summer. Students view the summer as their personal time off and would much rather enjoy that time then waste it on a difficult, time-consuming chore. Unfortunately, not completing your summer projects stops a students summer education (which impacts their overall education) and starts a students school year off in a negative, empty-handed way. To prevent that the simple solution is to let them take complete charge when it comes to their projects. Letting students design their own projects means making summer school projects enjoyable, challenging but understandable, and time-convenient.\\n\\nFirstly, a student will enjoy work more if they can personally relate to it. Teacher-designed summer projects are viewed as boring and unexciting, and due to them relating to the work of the class they typically are. To produce an enjoyable summer project a teacher must find something each student can relate to and include it. Unfortunately, a teacher cannot relate to every student in that way and the disconnect begins a dislike of the work in the student. Once that initial dislike is started it's difficult to get the student to complete the work. However, if a student can create the work they want to create, they're going to do so because only an individual student can relate to themselves in such a way. With a student-designed summer project the student can personally relate to the work, find it enjoyable, and feel encouraged to participate and complete it thus starting the continued learning.\\n\\nSecondly, a student will feel encouraged to complete the work if they understand it. When dealing with a teacher-designed summer project it is usually created to enlighten and prepare students as to what their coursework is going to be like. As classes go up so does their difficulty level. This explains why teacher-designed projects are challenging, especially for someone who has yet to take the actual class. A fear of failure and a lack of understanding can make any student want to neglect and not complete their work therefore putting an end to their summer break education. Giving students the right to create their own coursework means they can challenge themselves personally and understand it perfectly. Only students can know themselves well enough to classify their own difficult level and ensure their project reflects it. By doing so they can create practical, efficient work that is related to the coursework and understand it in their own way, much like what they would eventually have to do in the actual class.\\n\\nFinally, a student-designed project can ensure that a student will have enough time to complete the project. When a teacher designs a summer project they must make sure it covers enough information and takes up enough time. That can be stressful for students who don't have their entire summer off as most do. Students who work jobs, leave and visit other places, or even babysit their siblings don't have the same amount of time as most students and can feel overwhelmed by their inability to balance everything. That stress will force them to delay or discontinue their summer projects and put an end to their summer education. To prevent that a student-designed project means a project that can incorporate the individual student's schedule in and ensure they have enough time to complete it. Incorporating a busy student's schedule takes the stress off of their back and encourages them to put the time they have into creating an astounding summer project.\\n\\nMany could argue that a student-designed summer project will produce an unreliable project. Students can get lazy over summer break and decide to take the easier route instead of actually applying themselves. In the case of something like that occurring the only person the student is hurting is themselves.\\xa0If the student chooses not to apply themselves they are putting themselves\\xa0at a disadvantage. Taking this opportunity for granted will just ensure that a student's school life will not be any easier because of the grade they receive on it, and their lack of understanding with the coursework. Others could also claim that a student-designed project will not meet the required guidelines of the coursework but that lack of effort once again only hurts the student.\\n\\nIn conclusion, A student-designed project is a project that will encourage summer education by making summer projects enjoyable, understandable, and time convenient. Encouraging student to create and find new ways to understand difficult things guarantees them way to overcome the same trials throughout life. The ways to make summer projects fun and less work are simple and should be applied in every school that wants an efficient and practical summer education and students who will grow into well-rounded adults.\\xa0\", 'Opponents of the law contend that it is an infringement of civil liberties and can potentially be damaging to the relationship and trust between parents and teenagers. Ultimately, the decision to implement a curfew law should not be taken lightly and should be carefully considered before taking effect.. \\nThe implementation of a curfew law for teenagers is a highly debated topic. It is also essential to consider the potential effects on the relationship between youth and law enforcement, the financial impact it may have on city budgets, and how the law would be viewed by community members. Additionally, there is also concern that a curfew law could disproportionately affect teens of color.\\n\\nIn order to effectively evaluate the pros and cons of implementing a curfew law for teenagers in a given city, it is important to consider the implications of the law, its potential effects on teenagers, and how it would be enforced. Supporters of a curfew law claim that it can help decrease juvenile crime, improve public safety, and help young people focus on studies and other extracurricular activities', \" Personally, I have experienced both failure and success in different situations.  Taking a proactive attitude and reframing failure as a learning experience can be a great way to approach any difficult challenge. \\n\\nOne of the most common aspects of success is learning how to deal with failure. Taking the initiative to give something a different approach and keeping a positive outlook has certainly helped me better navigate my own experiences with failure and success.. If something isn't working, you can try something different and be open to exploring different opportunities. It's not easy to deal with failure, especially when you have high expectations. Despite many successful people having to face failure, they were able to learn from it and turn it into an opportunity for growth. When someone is afraid of failure, the best way to motivate them is to remind them that failure can be a lesson in the journey and that it shouldn't stop them from trying to reach their goals. There have been times when I've been close to giving up, only to find that the steps I took to change my perspective ultimately paid off. To succeed in difficult challenges, it's important to stay positive and prepared\", \"That helps me when customer is complaining about like a table is dirty, or floor is mess, I can go there quickly and clean them fast as I could and go back to my job.

Attending school requires students to physically go to a classroom and interact with their teacher and fellow students, while taking online classes or video conferences (especially during the pandemic) means that students can learn from home. Additionally, attending school gives students the chance to develop crucial social skills like working together and communication, which are essential for success in life, but are not possible in online classes or video conferences. On the other hand, one of the main advantages of taking online classes or video conferences is that students can have a flexible learning schedule, and study according to their own pace.\\n\\nUltimately, attending school is more effective for students in the long run, as it offers a more comprehensive educational approach. \\nAttending school and taking online classes or video conferences are both popular educational approaches these days, but they differ in several ways. \\n\\nThere are several advantages and drawbacks to attending school compared to taking online classes or video conferences. It is important for students to make use of the resources that attending school offers, in order to further their educational goals in the long run.. It is also worth noting that attending school is important for students from lower-income families, as it provides structure in their lives and the resources they need to pursue higher education, which are not always easily accessible. Having an experienced teacher to guide students in the classroom and take care of when they are having difficulties is much more beneficial than learning all by themselves at home. One big advantage of attending school is the hands-on learning opportunities, as students get to participate in experiments and practical projects which are impossible to do online', 'Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades.

Such resources may include specialized educators, supportive therapies, and the opportunity to attend special classes. This is due to many socioeconomic factors and the lack of appropriate support, leading to a myriad of developmental problems both now and later in life.

While their are valid concerns about the fairness and effectiveness of the Electoral College, I believe shah IH is important ho consider the practical reasons for keeping this system in place.\\n\\nOne of the key reasons for remaining the Electoral College is the certainly of outcome. Under this system, the winning candidate\\'s share of the Electoral College invariably exceeds his or her share of the popular vote. This ensures shah the election results are clear and conclusive, reducing the likelihood of disputed outcomes. In contrast, a direct popular vote could result in a close election and potential disputes over recounts and ballots, as seen in the 2000 election.\\n\\nAnother important advantage of the Electoral College is shah IH promotes the idea of \"everyone\\'s president.\" This system requires a presidential candidate ho have hransregional appeal in order ho secure enough electoral votes for victory. As a result, candidates are encouraged ho campaign in various regions and address a broader range of issues shah are important ho voters throughout the country. This helps prevent candidates from focusing solely on shahs where they are likely ho win and neglecting the interests of other regions.\\n\\nThe winnerhakeall method of awarding electoral votes also incentivizes candidates ho pay attention ho swing shahs. In these shahs, where the race is highly competitive, voters end ho be more engaged and informed, ash hey know their vote can have a significant impact on the outcome. By giving greater weight ho swing shahs, the Electoral College ensures shah the mosh thoughtful and engaged voters have a greater say in determining the election results.\\n\\nFurthermore, the Electoral College helps balance the political influence of large and small shahs. The malapporhionmenh of the Senate gives smaller shahs more representation per capital than larger shahs. The Electoral College restores some balance by giving larger shahs more attention from presidential candidates, ash hey have a greater number of electoral votes. This system ensures shah the concerns and interests of both large and small shahs are taken into account during the election process.\\n\\nLastly, the Electoral College avoids the need for runoff elections when no candidate receives a majority of the popular vote. This helps streamline the election process and ensures a clear winner. In situations where no candidate wins a majority, a runoff election can be complicated and time-consuming. The Electoral College prevents this by guaranteeing shah a candidate obtains a majority of electoral votes.\\n\\nWhile their are valid arguments against the Electoral College, such as the winnerhakeall system and the potential for candidates ho ignore certain shahs, the practical advantages IH offers outweigh these concerns. IH promotes certainly of outcome, encourages hransregional appeal, engages swing shahs, balances the influence of large and small shahs, and avoids the complications of runoff elections. These reasons demonstrate why the Electoral College should be remained for future presidential elections.\\n\\nThank you for considering my perspective on this important Mahler. I urge you ho carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both the Electoral College and direct popular vote systems before making any decisions. \\n\\nSincerely,\\n[Your Name]', 'In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author talks about Earth\\'s sister planet and the chaotic environment it hosts.

The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the risks and dangers Because evidence shows that it has features much like Earth, and could sometimes Ce the nearest option for a planetary visit.\\n\\nGeographical features show that at one time, Venus was likely covered with oceans and could have supported life. The author states, \"Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and includes familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters\" (4). This shows that while conditions on Venus may Ce particularly Brutal, there is a high chance it was once a habitable land like Earth.\\n\\nThough there are certainly high risks that come with traveling to such a dangerous planet, there are ways for humans to survive them. The author mentions that, \"Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions CY staying up and out of their way. ... the air pressure would Ce close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would Ce plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels\" (5).

In other words, If you hand me 2 stacks of paper and give me 2 days to fill it out, I will. You are probably thinking, \"Generic_Name, everyone can be a well rounded person in their own ways\". Speaking 2 languages is great. I heard that you are accepting people to come look at some businesses they prefer, and learn more about what they are interested in.

Many of us are volunteering our time and energy to make our school a better place. Whether it's assisting with someone's homework, cleaning up our classrooms and school grounds, or talking to our parents about community service, it's all making a difference. Our collective efforts are having a direct and positive impact on our learning environment. Thank you.\", '\"Phones and driving\"\\n\\nToday\\'s generation, phones are becoming an issue on the roads and putting people\\'s lives at rise.\\n\\nPhones should not be allowed to be touched or played on as you are on the roads so that you are fully aware of what\\'s going on in your surroundings and also not taming your eyes off the roads. Texting while driving may ruin yours or another person\\'s life.\\n\\nThere are a lot of rises that could happen and put your life or someone else\\'s lives in danger. Most people pick up the phone because they say it\\'s important, but even then the phone would be a distraction. Tame a moment to sit and thing about how many accidents occur because of a text, now thing about in old times when texting while driving was not a problem at all.\\n\\nAuthorities put down strict detailed laws about having your phone in your hand while driving. Each offense doubles every time you get caught, but this law was hardly effective because no one is taming the safer advice to insure the safety of yourself and others on the roads. The fines would turn into something more serious and if you got into a wreck, injuring another person you could more than likely spent some jail time.\\n\\nI Now phones shouldn\\'t be allowed to be messed with while you are driving because imagine if it were you in the situation and getting into a wreck all because someone was paying attention to their phone and not the road. You could lose it all in a blind of an eye, or you could made someone else loses everything, don\\'t be that person because either one there are causes and effects to your actions even if you didn\\'t get hurt, you probably hurt someone else that has family that loves them lime crazy.\\n\\nhttps://www.

Com/story/news/nation now/2018/07/02/georgiahandsfreelawbansholdingphonewhiledriving/752752002/ ', 'While working alone is beneficial in some cases, it is often more beneficial to have a group of people who are dedicated and motivated to work together towards a common goal. Working in a group also leads to a sense of community and collaboration, which can help build rapport between members. Discussions and brainstorming can help bring new and innovative ideas to the table and help everyone learn from each other. For starters, when trying to tackle a complex problem or project, there is often more brain power within a group than an individual. This helps create a supportive and encouraging environment, which can inspire individuals to continue working hard and reach their goals. \\nWhen considering the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that teamwork has certain advantages. From increased productivity and effort, to learning from each other and creating a sense of community, working in a group can help people to make progress on challenging projects, learn new skills, and work together towards a common goal.. Working in a group enables different individuals to come together and share their unique insights and perspectives, helping complete the task quickly and efficiently. \\n\\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there are many benefits of working in a group versus working alone. Working in a group also allows people to divide the workload, so each individual is responsible for a certain component or task. This can help ensure that no one person is overwhelmed with too much work and hold the team accountable for completing their tasks in a timely manner.\\n\\nFurthermore, working with others provides an opportunity for people to learn from each other', \"Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class.\\n\\nFirst, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation.\\n\\nSecondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.\\n\\nIn conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesn't have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher.\\n\\nLastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldn't be an option to students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. Take for example my cousin, She's taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesn't understand the explanation they are giving her. . For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work\", 'The early completion of high school will also open up the doors to more personal opportunities. As a young adult, there are many opportunities for travel, volunteer work, internships, apprenticeships, or even higher education to pursue. Being young allows the individual more freedom to explore and do more in life. This could be in fields such as entrepreneurship, coding, web development, project management, analytics, or consulting. For those who opt to complete their secondary education at a younger age, they will have access to an array of longer professional fields to explore, and potentially even establish themselves within sooner than their peers. Additionally, younger adults are physically stronger and more resilient, allowing them to take on more physically-demanding jobs.. \\nCompleting high school earlier than the traditional age of 18 or 19 can offer many benefits, both professionally and personally', \"In school there are a lot of fun and educational activities. If there wasn't any fun science experiments; I wouldn't like to go to science.\\n\\nSome kids say that science is the worst subject in school and it is boring. my most favorite experiment is when we are mixing chemicals because you don't have a major clue of what is going to happen when you mix them up, and that is what makes it interesting and fun at the sma time. There are more experiments that you do in science like making a volcano eruption or something else but science can be fun if you pay attention to what the teacher is saying and following the rules because there can be fun but there has to be rules or somebody can get hurt\\n\\nIn conclusion there might be some better educational activities but in my opinion i like more science experiments, however, it does get boring sometimes and you just don't want to do anything, therefor, you just can't complain about life, you just got to with it and enjoy it .. In science there are a lot of awesome experiments and tools you can use, and they are fun to use. One of my favorite activity to do in school is a science experiment. In my opinion scinece has a lot of cool stuff that you can't do in any other fun activity in school\", \"\\nAttending school is a vital step in any individual's life and is imperative to achieving future success. In addition, formal schooling introduces students to a number of career pathways that can shape their educational and professional paths for years to come.\\n\\nHowever, prioritizing school is not always a simple task. With every educational opportunity, come a multitude of greater opportunities. \\n\\nThe importance of attending school is inarguable and should not be taken lightly. Despite her determination to further her studies, she was met with a delayed success. Although education does not guarantee the outcome, it does afford us the tools needed to take us one step closer to our eventual success.. Financial obligations, mental health issues and family responsibilities can take precedence and lead some students astray from their primary focus of attending school. For example, Samantha was unable to attend college due to the financial strain and having to become the primary provider for her household. Some students may struggle to stay focused due to the variety of distractions brought on by life outside of the classroom. Education helps to foster the development of necessary life skills such as problem solving, communication, and critical thinking. Education serves as the explorer's map to success for the future. School provides an array of experiences and lessons that cannot be taught outside of the classroom\", '\\n\\nWith its emphasis on teamwork, speed, and skill, soccer is a great way to build skills. \\nSoccer is one of the oldest sports in the world, with a rich and vibrant history. They can help to develop useful skills, foster enjoyment, and provide a much needed break from school work.. Its roots extend back to ancient Greece, where it was played in the form of the ball-game Harpastum. It also encourages creativity and problem-solving abilities. Soccer follows more specific rules and regulations than physical education, making it more competitive and fast-paced. Participating in physical activities creates a more relaxed atmosphere, taking the mind off of the pressures of schoolwork. Over the centuries, soccer has become a popular sport in many cultures and it has been embraced as a way to promote physical education. \\n\\nPhysical education not only helps to build physical abilities, but it can also lead to enjoyment. It teaches skills like cooperation, communication, and discipline, which can be useful in the classroom. \\n\\nOverall, soccer and physical education both have great value in terms of providing physical and mental benefits. \\n\\nAlthough soccer and physical education share many similarities, there are also differences in the way they work. Conversely, physical education often focuses more on individual efforts and creative endeavours, providing a comfortable environment for students to express themselves and have fun. It can be an escape that can help students to focus and recharge. Playing soccer helps to increase physical fitness, strengthens agility, and promotes self-confidence', 'This time he studied much better than the first time but he didn\\'t pass it again, he felt stressful \"what\\'s going on to me\" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didn\\'t pass it as well. But it wasn\\'t that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldn\\'t pass it at the first time. They also believe that it\\'s really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you don\\'t achieve success.\\n\\nOne reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, it\\'s a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent. Now I have a car and my driver\\'s license even though I was hard to make it. The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. In that point I wasn\\'s really sure if I wanted to continue with that. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. Actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. But should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal.\\n\\nThose who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times.\\n\\nOther reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. As the British Prime\\n\\nMinister Winston Churchill once said \"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm\". A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. If I hadn\\'t been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldn\\'t have gotten my driver license. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. If Generic_Name hadn\\'t been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldn\\'t have passed the text. Adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals.         . As example of this is my self. They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldn\\'t have done before, is a way to waste time because, you\\'re not going to complete it anyways. Everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and don\\'t give to get success. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes.\\n\\nIn conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchill\\'s statement, and I\\'m agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. As result he passed the test with a good score', \"\\n\\nIn conclusion, the growth of technology has made a huge impact on our lives. With more online services and options available for customers than ever before, technology is here to stay.. \\nThe growth of technology has had a tremendous impact on people's lives in the 21st century. \\n\\nThe development of online jobs, such as being a YouTuber or investing in stocks, have changed the way people work and made professional success much more accessible. This impact is perhaps felt most strongly in the rise of online technology, which has allowed people to acquire knowledge and skills, search for jobs, and do their shopping more conveniently. It allows us to access quality education, search for jobs, and do their shopping more conveniently.  \\n\\nOne of the advantages of online education is that it's now easier and more cost effective than ever for people to access quality education. Despite the potential profits, there are associated risks as well. \\n\\nLastly, online shopping has completely revolutionized the way people buy and receive goods. Popular companies such as Amazon have made it incredibly convenient for customers to order and receive the items they need, and the convenience factor and competitive prices make it an attractive alternative for people all over the world. For example, a case study of my brother's online courses has demonstrated the effectiveness of digital learning for better career opportunities\", \"Doesn't the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. Even machines don't work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.. Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Don't they need any break. If you can't have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you don't get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ?\\n\\nHigh school isn't just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. We hope to do so much but can't accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school.\\n\\nIn the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Human beings don't need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day.\\n\\nMore ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face.\\n\\nMemories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. It will always hunt you in your dreams. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell 'no' sometimes. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesn't serve a purpose. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools.\\n\\nBeing a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins\", \"at night.

Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble.\\n\\nLastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea.\\n\\nIn the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. m. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship.\\n\\nIn conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. No one knows what is going to happen next. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. m. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer.\\n\\nAdditionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family.\\n\\nHowever, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young people's lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Let's make the adoption of curfews come true! . Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier.

Ultimately, it is better to aim high and strive for success, as it can be used as a learning experience and motivator to reach for one’s goals.. Despite hardships, she pursued her goal of athletic greatness and achieved it, against all odds. Along with her own hard work, she was driven by her determination and a determination to reach her own potential. Even when presented with failure, Wilma saw it as a learning experience and she was motivated to strive for the success she deserved. \\n    One of the greatest examples of success against the odds is Wilma Rudolph, a champion Olympian who overcame childhood polio to become one of the greatest sprinters in history. Achieving partially is better than not achieving at all, and the possibility of not reaching a goal is far less than the possibility of success', 'Mhe benefits of taking music, drama, or art classes in school are numerous. Art classes can help students practice an important form of self expression, while music and drama classes can boost confidence and cultivate creative problem solving and communication skills. \\n\\nHowever, some students may not want or be able to take these classes for various personal reasons, such as having limited free time or feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve. When parents force their children to take such classes, the students often lose their motivation to perform, and may grow to resent the activity as a result. \\n\\nIt is often argued that making these classes compulsory could lead to a loss in the authenticity of the activities being taught. Students may lack an enthusiasm for learning the skills required for the class, and this can have a negative effect on their interest and the quality of their work. \\n\\nUltimately, the decision to take music, drama, or art classes should be driven by the passion of the student. If the student truly loves an activity, they will be more inclined to take an active role in their studies, regardless of whether the activity is compulsory.', 'I disagree that this Facial Action Coding system is beneficial for the classroom. There are many things about this that could go wrong. This type of secondly would not be valuable to our schools.\\n\\nAlthough all the facial recognition sounds good, there are some parts to it that could be bad. There are many things that could turn out to be negative. Here is a question to think about: Is he downgrading teachers? In the sixth paragraph Dr. Huang of the Beckman Institute for Advanced science predicts, \"A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored\", he continues with, \"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor.\" I believe he is trying to say that teachers don\\'t do enough, so we have to bring in a computer instructor to make it less boring. This is not only bad for the students, but also the teachers.\\n\\nThis also can be a distraction in class. While the teacher is giving a lecture about an important skill that students need to learn, there are students in the back of the classroom trying to mess around with the facial coding system by trying different faces and causing a disruption. Kids are easily distracted and this is just another distraction from keeping kids engaged and focused on the studies that they will need for the rest of their life.\\n\\nWhile a child is learning, for instance, a math program site, they could be trying to get in it, but there are ads that pop up, in paragraph 6 it states that \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.

I believe that there are lots of things that could go wrong, and not enough right.

With year-round schooling, students can take more refresher courses throughout the year in order to maintain their skill level. Educators also benefit from year-round schooling. With more learning happening throughout the year, educators can spend more time honing the skills of each student to ensure mastery in the areas of focus. \\nYear-round school offers tremendous benefits for both students and educators. One major benefit for students is greater academic achievement. For example, an educator might spend additional time with a student who needs help with a particular subject, enabling the student to better understand and retain the material. Additionally, students benefit from more regular opportunities to communicate with their peers and teachers, resulting in improved engagement in the classroom', \"\\nWhen discussing the potential for the school board to add one and a half hour to school each day, there are several aspects to consider in order to determine if this is a good decision. Firstly, time spent in classes would be extended which may affect the quality of student interactions with the material in the allotted period. \\n\\nDespite the potential downsides, longer school days could be beneficial in the long-term. Additionally, shorter recess periods could lead to an unsatisfactory amount of time for physical activity and communication with peers. \\n\\nUltimately, whether or not the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day is up for debate. It is essential to consider the short-term and long-term impacts of this decision on students, such as length of class time, standardized testing, recess, and the future success of students.. Also, longer school days may mean longer days for tests and standardized tests such as SOLs, which could lead to exhaustion and an inability to perform to the best of one's ability. This in turn could help to develop their overall understanding of their subsequent academic path, allowing them to be better prepared when the time comes. With more time spent in a learning environment, students could hone their skills and have better access to resources which may help them in achieving their dream in the future\", '\\nThe organization I am applying for offers numerous opportunities to those seeking to gain new skills and experience in a vibrant learning environment.

As a result, she lacks the time and energy to focus on what she actually loves, which hinders her studies and puts her future career in jeopardy. Since he doesn't have the same interests as the rest of the students and the principal doesn't provide options for different extracurricular activities, Adam is not able to pursue his dream in the school hours and is limited in his educational and career progress. \\n\\nIn summary, forcing all students to participate in the same extracurricular activities suppresses their individual self-development and doesn't allow them to pursue the things they are truly passionate about. But due to the principal's rule, she is forced to participate in the school's basketball team. Students should be able to decide for themselves how to spend their free time, as this allows them to find their own passions and interests, which can help them to have a successful and fulfilling life. \\n\\nFor example, Betty is an academically driven student who is extremely passionate about mathematics, and wants to pursue a career in computer science. . \\nForcing all students to participate in extracurricular activities can be detrimental to their own self-development\", 'If I\\'m imaging myself to be a scientist at NASA discussing the FACE with someone who thinks it was created by aliens because why would the moon have faces on it and Plus humans can\\'t be out in outer space without an space suit because they can die within seconds.\\n\\nAnd if I have some scientist Partners that trust me and believe what I\\'m saying because anything or anyone could have done this for fun.\\n\\nIt just takes time to figure out what\\'s going on, on the moon.

During his career, Pele won several World Cups and scored over 1,000 goals. Some believe failure to be synonymous with personal or career stagnation, while others view failure as a necessary learning experience. This idea serves as a reminder that failure can be an important step on the path to ultimate success.. Whatever one’s opinion may be, it is clear failure can have both a positive and negative impact on one’s overall success.\\n\\nWinston Churchill famously said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” Churchill’s words reflect the critical role of both failures and enthusiasm when it comes to achieving success. Additionally, the international body had no armed forces of its own to ensure cooperation, making it unable to keep a handle on the international system in the decades leading up to WWII.\\n\\nMeanwhile, famed soccer player Pele is one of the most celebrated sportspeople of all time, with competitive success being perhaps his greatest accomplishment. He underscores the importance of perseverance and the risk of giving up because of fear of failure. His playing career is considered an example of determination and resolve in the face of failure.\\n\\nThe space program has faced a number of failed attempts at launching spaceships over the years. Without the United States’ support, it lacked the necessary power to enforce collective security. Whether it’s a lack of fuel, a key component malfunction, or other issues, failed space launches have been a part of the exploration of space since its inception.\\n\\nArguments against the idea of failure being related to success are varied', 'Furthermore, these partnerships can often lead to internships and job opportunities as students build relationships with professionals. Not only are students exposed to different work environments and taught the necessary job skills, but they are able to acquire an understanding of what job requirements are expected. They gain a sense of professionalism and confidence in their abilities, as well as an understanding of the requirements needed to succeed in a given position. These partnerships are essential for providing students with a well-rounded view of the workplace. By gaining experience in the corporate setting, students are better prepared for their future careers. \\nPartnerships between schools and companies have many benefits for students. All of these advantages can be realized through partnerships between schools and companies, providing students with an invaluable opportunity to prepare for their future.', \"Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead OT going to the school because they could work at their own Face.

The rewards of setting a goal and working hard to achieve it are worth the hard work and determination that comes with it.\\n\\nBy taking inspiration from Thomas Jefferson and the other great innovators of our time, it is possible to recognize the importance of never giving up. The courage and resilience demonstrated by those who are seeing their dreams come to life, often in spite of challenges, is nothing short of incredible. \\nThroughout history, great figures who embody the spirit of never giving up in pursuit of a dream have proven that anything is possible, no matter the odds. Today, Thomas Jefferson stands as an example of this, having overcome many political and personal obstacles to become the 3rd President of the United States. While understandable to feel frustrated, overwhelmed, or discouraged, it is important to remember that no one's success comes without many hours and great effort. Through perseverance and relentless effort, it is possible to make your dreams come true, no matter the odds. As Jefferson wrote in a letter to a friend, “I am determined to fag no more, to be content with nothing short of perfection; and, if I cannot get it, rather than be contented with less, I will remain uneducated.” \\n\\nThis sentiment is as relevant today as it was throughout Jefferson's life\", 'I had to make a diction on if I should go in and get my mom or go to the lady that fell. The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said,\"No act of kindness, no matter how small,is ever wasted.\"\\n\\nIn the futerch there will be more acts of kindness that way we can be happy with one another\\n\\nI hope that I am right about there being more acts of kindness ,but there are not a lot of people who do acts of kindness. in the place\\n\\nI lived in there were always contortion going on. For Example,if you help them water there plants you can make them happy. We all have to do something for a act of kindness also by doing something like that you feel better about your self before you help someone. Make your friend happy by doing something kind for them because you never know what they are going though. when we were my step brother had to get something and i stayed outside when the workers began to work aging. When you do a good thing for someone they feel happy even if it is a small thing you do for them. You also never know what someone else is going though ether.\\n\\nI think what the Greek storyteller Aesop is trying to say is just be kind to people. That\\'s why we need more people to do more acts of kindness.. You can make a now friend by doing something kind ,or by just being nines to them. I feel that people should do more acts of kindness. If you have time go to a nursing home and bring flowers to the elderly women. Will there was elderly layde that was outside when i was outside. I got my mom and went to her then my mom called 911\\n\\nto come get her. Doing a act of kindness can make someone happy if they had a bad day. We all have those day were it is just a bad one and you dont want to do any thing well if someone does something for you with them not knowing you had a bad day at school or at work. When they starred they scared the lady that was outside. there should be more people to do something kind to other people.\\n\\nFor Example, it a trash day were it came later then before me, and my step brother had to take the trash done to the side of the road. A good way to do a act of kindness is by helping your mom Cooke diner another way you can help is by doing something you don\\'t have to be asked to do', 'Immersing oneself in the culture of the school system is also a must; internships and/or shadowing a teacher should be considered as part of this exploration. \\nBecoming a teacher requires a commitment of both time and energy. As part of the process, research into the profession is paramount. Additionally, library research into the trends in education should be conducted to ensure the most up-to-date strategies are employed. From books, articles, and speaking with professionals in the field, potential teachers should become well-versed in the responsibilities, qualifications, and requirements needed to become a successful teacher. Finally, it is important to develop a comprehensive plan outlining the steps needed to become a teacher. With due diligence and dedication, one can enter the teaching profession and make a positive impact on students’ lives.', 'He also needed knowledge in order to know what was out there in deep space and to know the truth behind black holes and all that cool\\\\space stuff. Imagination is a real thing. If you have ever done something wrong, you might want to \"think before you act.\" If you were to do something without knowing the consequences, you\\'re going to get in trouble. I agree with Albert Einstein\\'s quote,\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\" I agree with this quote because, knowledge is building up in your mind little by little because people are teaching it to you.\\n\\nEven though knowledge is going to be extremely helpful in the career you desire to have, you must have imagination in order to \"look\" into the future and see yourself doing something good with your life. Imagination is what you want it to be, nobody can control it because it\\'s yours to keep and think about in your mind. Even though knowledge is really important to learn, it may go away or you might not need it in the future career or job you wish to do.\\n\\nLife is full of bad people. I think imagination is like a little world in your mind that only you can control. Also things that you learn in life might not be used in the future or in the career you fore seek to be doing. you might also want to have knowledge because if you thought of the consequences and or imagined them, you wouldnt of done it in the first place.. What if bad people that are in jail right now, would\\'ve thought of the consequences before committing the crime? Yea, they probably wouldnt of done it. Since you already did them you\\'re have a good visual of what you might expect to happen to you in the future if you did something wrong without thinking about it. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much.\\n\\nAlbert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. In my opinion, i think what Albert Einstein is saying, might be true. Another good reason is to learn from your mistakes. Einstein was one of the smartest human beings on earth known to man kind. Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. Example, if you wanted to prank a teacher on the last day of school or hitting a school clock, causing it to fall and break, you might want to think before you act.\\n\\nYou might also want to \"imagine\" what would happen to you in the future if you did something wrong', \"However, they can also encourage competition and competition-related stress in students, leading to lower self-esteem and decreased academic performance.. A lack of sleep, poor nutrition, and increased stress can all lead to burnout and decreased school performance. \\nExtracurricular activities have been widely studied in relation to student educational outcomes and the opinions of parents. Research has shown that students who participate in organized extracurricular activities tend to demonstrate improved academic performance and greater interest in learning. On the positive side, incentives can help to increase participation in extracurricular activities and may help to further stimulate the academic performance of students. At the same time, parents often become involved in their children's extracurricular activities, providing further support for academic achievement.\\n\\nHowever, extracurricular activities can also have negative effects, particularly when students participate in too much activity. Over-scheduling students can also have detrimental effects on their physical and mental health. \\n\\nFinally, introducing incentive rules for extracurricular activities in a school system can have both positive and negative effects\"]\n",
