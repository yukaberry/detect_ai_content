From \\nthe latter came the low murmur of a lazy surf, but the sheltered stretch of water, \\nnot more than a hundred yards across to the white beach of pounded coral sand, \\nwas of glass-like smoothness. Narrow as was the passage, and anchored as she \\nwas in the shoalest place that gave room to swing, the Willi-Waw's chain rode up-\\nand-down a clean hundred feet. Its course could be traced over the bottom of \\nliving coral. Like some monstrous snake, the rusty chain's slack wandered over \\nthe ocean floor, crossing and recrossing itself several times and fetching up finally \\nat the idle anchor. Big rock-cod, dun and mottled, played warily in and out of the \\ncoral. Other fish, grotesque of form and colour, were brazenly indifferent, even \\nwhen a big fish-shark drifted sluggishly along and sent the rock-cod scuttling for \\ntheir favourite crevices. \\n \\nOn deck, for'ard, a dozen blacks pottered clumsily at scraping the teak rail. They \\nwere as inexpert at their work as so many monkeys. In fact they looked very \\nmuch like monkeys of some enlarged and prehistoric type. Their eyes had in them \\nthe querulous plaintiveness of the monkey, their faces were even less symmetrical \\nthan the monkey's, and, hairless of body, they were far more ungarmented than \\nany monkey, for clothes they had none. Decorated they were as no monkey ever \\nwas. In holes in their ears they carried short clay pipes, rings of turtle shell, huge \\nplugs of wood, rusty wire nails, and empty rifle cartridges. The calibre of a \\nWinchester rifle was the smallest hole an ear bore; some of the largest holes were \\ninches in diameter, and any single ear averaged from three to half a dozen holes. \\nSpikes and bodkins of polished bone or petrified shell were thrust through their \\nnoses. On the chest of one hung a white doorknob, on the chest of another the \\nhandle of a china cup, on the chest of a third the brass cogwheel of an alarm \\nclock. They chattered in queer, falsetto voices, and, combined, did no more work \\nthan a single white sailor. \\n \\nAft, under an awning, were two white men. Each was clad in a six-penny \\nundershirt and wrapped about the loins with a strip of cloth. Belted about the \\nmiddle of each was a revolver and tobacco pouch. The sweat stood out on their \\nskin in myriads of globules. Here and there the globules coalesced in tiny streams \\nthat dripped to the heated deck and almost immediately evaporated. The lean, \\ndark-eyed man wiped his fingers wet with a stinging stream from his forehead \\nand flung it from him with a weary curse. Wearily, and without hope, he gazed \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n4 \\nseaward across the outer-reef, and at the tops of the palms along the beach. \\n \\n\"Eight o\\'clock, an\\' hell don\\'t get hot till noon,\" he complained. \"Wisht to God for a \\nbreeze. Ain\\'t we never goin\\' to get away?\" \\n \\nThe other man, a slender German of five and twenty, with the massive forehead of \\na scholar and the tumble-home chin of a degenerate, did not trouble to reply. He \\nwas busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette paper. Rolling what was \\napproximately fifty grains of the drug into a tight wad, he tossed it into his mouth \\nand gulped it down without the aid of water. \\n \\n\"Wisht I had some whiskey,\" the first man panted, after a fifteen-minute interval \\nof silence. \\n \\nAnother equal period elapsed ere the German enounced, relevant of nothing: \\n \\n\"I\\'m rotten with fever. I\\'m going to quit you, Griffiths, when we get to Sydney. No \\nmore tropics for me. I ought to known better when I signed on with you.\" \\n \\n\"You ain\\'t been much of a mate,\" Griffiths replied, too hot himself to speak \\nheatedly. \"When the beach at Guvutu heard I\\'d shipped you, they all laughed. \\n\\'What? Jacobsen?\\' they said. \\'You can\\'t hide a square face of trade gin or \\nsulphuric acid that he won\\'t smell out!\\' You\\'ve certainly lived up to your \\nreputation. I ain\\'t had a drink for a fortnight, what of your snoopin\\' my supply.\" \\n \\n\"If the fever was as rotten in you as me, you\\'d understand,\" the mate whimpered. \\n \\n\"I ain\\'t kickin\\',\" Griffiths answered. \"I only wisht God\\'d send me a drink, or a \\nbreeze of wind, or something. I\\'m ripe for my next chill to-morrow.\" \\n \\nThe mate proffered him the quinine. Rolling a fifty-grain dose, he popped the wad \\ninto his mouth and swallowed it dry. \\n \\n\"God! God!\" he moaned. \"I dream of a land somewheres where they ain\\'t no \\nquinine. Damned stuff of hell! I\\'ve scoffed tons of it in my time.\" \\n \\nAgain he quested seaward for signs of wind. The usual trade-wind clouds were \\nabsent, and the sun, still low in its climb to meridian, turned all the sky to heated \\nbrass. One seemed to see as well as feel this heat, and Griffiths sought vain relief \\nby gazing shoreward. The white beach was a searing ache to his eyeballs. The \\npalm trees, absolutely still, outlined flatly against the unrefreshing green of the \\npacked jungle, seemed so much cardboard scenery. The little black boys, playing \\nnaked in the dazzle of sand and sun, were an affront and a hurt to the sun-sick \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n5 \\nman. He felt a sort of relief when one, running, tripped and fell on all-fours in the \\ntepid sea-water. \\n \\nAn exclamation from the blacks for\\'ard sent both men glancing seaward. Around \\nthe near point of land, a quarter of a mile away and skirting the reef, a long black \\ncanoe paddled into sight. \\n \\n\"Gooma boys from the next bight,\" was the mate\\'s verdict. \\n \\nOne of the blacks came aft, treading the hot deck with the unconcern of one \\nwhose bare feet felt no heat. This, too, was a hurt to Griffiths, and he closed his \\neyes. But the next moment they were open wide. \\n \\n\"White fella marster stop along Gooma boy,\" the black said. \\n \\nBoth men were on their feet and gazing at the canoe. Aft could be seen the \\nunmistakable sombrero of a white man. Quick alarm showed itself on the face of \\nthe mate. \\n \\n\"It\\'s Grief,\" he said. \\n \\nGriffiths satisfied himself by a long look, then ripped out a wrathful oath. \\n \\n\"What\\'s he doing up here?\" he demanded of the mate, of the aching sea and sky, \\nof the merciless blaze of sun, and of the whole superheated and implacable \\nuniverse with which his fate was entangled. \\n \\nThe mate began to chuckle. \\n \\n\"I told you you couldn\\'t get away with it,\" he said. \\n \\nBut Griffiths was not listening. \\n \\n\"With all his money, coming around like a rent collector,\" he chanted his outrage, \\nalmost in an ecstasy of anger. \"He\\'s loaded with money, he\\'s stuffed with money, \\nhe\\'s busting with money. I know for a fact he sold his Yringa plantations for three \\nhundred thousand pounds. Bell told me so himself last time we were drunk at \\nGuvutu. Worth millions and millions, and Shylocking me for what he wouldn\\'t \\nlight his pipe with.\" He whirled on the mate. \"Of course you told me so. Go on and \\nsay it, and keep on saying it. Now just what was it you did tell me so?\" \\n \\n\"I told you you didn\\'t know him, if you thought you could clear the Solomons \\nwithout paying him. That man Grief is a devil, but he\\'s straight. I know. I told you \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n6 \\nhe\\'d throw a thousand quid away for the fun of it, and for sixpence fight like a \\nshark for a rusty tin, I tell you I know. Didn\\'t he give his Balakula to the \\nQueensland Mission when they lost their Evening Star on San Cristobal?--and \\nthe Balakula worth three thousand pounds if she was worth a penny? And didn\\'t \\nhe beat up Strothers till he lay abed a fortnight, all because of a difference of two \\npound ten in the account, and because Strothers got fresh and tried to make the \\ngouge go through?\" \\n \\n\"God strike me blind!\" Griffiths cried in im-potency of rage. \\n \\nThe mate went on with his exposition. \\n \\n\"I tell you only a straight man can buck a straight man like him, and the man\\'s \\nnever hit the Solomons that could do it. Men like you and me can\\'t buck him. \\nWe\\'re too rotten, too rotten all the way through. You\\'ve got plenty more than \\ntwelve hundred quid below. Pay him, and get it over with.\" \\n \\nBut Griffiths gritted his teeth and drew his thin lips tightly across them. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll buck him,\" he muttered--more to himself and the brazen ball of sun than to \\nthe mate. He turned and half started to go below, then turned back again. \"Look \\nhere, Jacob-sen. He won\\'t be here for quarter of an hour. Are you with me? Will \\nyou stand by me?\" \\n \\n\"Of course I\\'ll stand by you. I\\'ve drunk all your whiskey, haven\\'t I? What are you \\ngoing to do?\" \\n \\n\"I\\'m not going to kill him if I can help it. But I\\'m not going to pay. Take that flat.\" \\n \\nJacobsen shrugged his shoulders in calm acquiescence to fate, and Griffiths \\nstepped to the companionway and went below. \\n \\nII \\n \\nJacobsen watched the canoe across the low reef as it came abreast and passed on \\nto the entrance of the passage. Griffiths, with ink-marks on right thumb and \\nforefinger, returned on deck Fifteen minutes later the canoe came alongside. The \\nman with the sombrero stood up. \\n \\n\"Hello, Griffiths!\" he said. \"Hello, Jacobsen!\" With his hand on the rail he turned \\nto his dusky crew. \"You fella boy stop along canoe altogether.\" \\n \\nAs he swung over the rail and stepped on deck a hint of catlike litheness showed \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n7 \\nin the apparently heavy body. Like the other two, he was scantily clad. The cheap \\nundershirt and white loin-cloth did not serve to hide the well put up body. Heavy \\nmuscled he was, but he was not lumped and hummocked by muscles. They were \\nsoftly rounded, and, when they did move, slid softly and silkily under the smooth, \\ntanned skin. Ardent suns had likewise tanned his face till it was swarthy as a \\nSpaniard\\'s. The yellow mustache appeared incongruous in the midst of such \\nswarthiness, while the clear blue of the eyes produced a feeling of shock on the \\nbeholder. It was difficult to realize that the skin of this man had once been fair. \\n \\n\"Where did you blow in from?\" Griffiths asked, as they shook hands. \"I thought \\nyou were over in the Santa Cruz.\" \\n \\n\"I was,\" the newcomer answered. \"But we made a quick passage. The Wonder\\'s \\njust around in the bight at Gooma, waiting for wind. Some of the bushmen \\nreported a ketch here, and I just dropped around to see. Well, how goes it?\" \\n \\n\"Nothing much. Copra sheds mostly empty, and not half a dozen tons of ivory \\nnuts. The women all got rotten with fever and quit, and the men can\\'t chase them \\nback into the swamps. They\\'re a sick crowd. I\\'d ask you to have a drink, but the \\nmate finished off my last bottle. I wisht to God for a breeze of wind.\" \\n \\nGrief, glancing with keen carelessness from one to the other, laughed. \\n \\n\"I\\'m glad the calm held,\" he said. \"It enabled me to get around to see you. My \\nsupercargo dug up that little note of yours, and I brought it along.\" \\n \\nThe mate edged politely away, leaving his skipper to face his trouble. \\n \\n\"I\\'m sorry, Grief, damned sorry,\" Griffiths said, \"but I ain\\'t got it. You\\'ll have to \\ngive me a little more time.\" \\n \\nGrief leaned up against the companionway, surprise and pain depicted on his \\nface. \\n \\n\"It does beat hell,\" he communed, \"how men learn to lie in the Solomons. The \\ntruth\\'s not in them. Now take Captain Jensen. I\\'d sworn by his truthfulness. \\nWhy, he told me only five days ago--do you want to know what he told me?\" \\n \\nGriffiths licked his lips. \\n \\n\"Go on.\" \\n \\n\"Why, he told me that you\\'d sold out--sold out everything, cleaned up, and was \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n8 \\npulling out for the New Hebrides.\" \\n \\n\"He\\'s a damned liar!\" Griffiths cried hotly. \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"I should say so. He even had the nerve to tell me that he\\'d bought two of your \\nstations from you--Mauri and Kahula. Said he paid you seventeen hundred gold \\nsovereigns, lock, stock and barrel, good will, trade-goods, credit, and copra.\" \\n \\nGriffiths\\'s eyes narrowed and glinted. The action was involuntary, and Grief noted \\nit with a lazy sweep of his eyes. \\n \\n\"And Parsons, your trader at Hickimavi, told me that the Fulcrum Company had \\nbought that station from you. Now what did he want to lie for?\" \\n \\nGriffiths, overwrought by sun and sickness, exploded. All his bitterness of spirit \\nrose up in his face and twisted his mouth into a snarl. \\n \\n\"Look here, Grief, what\\'s the good of playing with me that way? You know, and I \\nknow you know. Let it go at that. I have sold out, and I am getting away. And \\nwhat are you going to do about it?\" \\n \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders, and no hint of resolve shadowed itself in his own \\nface. His expression was as of one in a quandary. \\n \\n\"There\\'s no law here,\" Griffiths pressed home his advantage. \"Tulagi is a hundred \\nand fifty miles away. I\\'ve got my clearance papers, and I\\'m on my own boat. \\nThere\\'s nothing to stop me from sailing. You\\'ve got no right to stop me just \\nbecause I owe you a little money. And by God! you can\\'t stop me. Put that in your \\npipe.\" \\n \\nThe look of pained surprise on Grief\\'s face deepened. \\n \\n\"You mean you\\'re going to cheat me out of that twelve hundred, Griffiths?\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s just about the size of it, old man. And calling hard names won\\'t help any. \\nThere\\'s the wind coming. You\\'d better get overside before I pull out, or I\\'ll tow \\nyour canoe under.\" \\n \\n\"Really, Griffiths, you sound almost right. I can\\'t stop you.\" Grief fumbled in the \\npouch that hung on his revolver-belt and pulled out a crumpled official-looking \\npaper. \"But maybe this will stop you. And it\\'s something for your pipe. Smoke \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n9 \\nup.\" \\n \\n\"What is it?\" \\n \\n\"An admiralty warrant. Running to the New Hebrides won\\'t save you. It can be \\nserved anywhere.\" \\n \\nGriffiths hesitated and swallowed, when he had finished glancing at the \\ndocument. With knit brows he pondered this new phase of the situation. Then, \\nabruptly, as he looked up, his face relaxed into all frankness. \\n \\n\"You were cleverer than I thought, old man,\" he said. \"You\\'ve got me hip and \\nthigh. I ought to have known better than to try and beat you. Jacobsen told me I \\ncouldn\\'t, and I wouldn\\'t listen to him. But he was right, and so are you. I\\'ve got \\nthe money below. Come on down and we\\'ll settle.\" \\n \\nHe started to go down, then stepped aside to let his visitor precede him, at the \\nsame time glancing seaward to where the dark flaw of wind was quickening the \\nwater. \\n \\n\"Heave short,\" he told the mate. \"Get up sail and stand ready to break out.\" \\n \\nAs Grief sat down on the edge of the mate\\'s bunk, close against and facing the \\ntiny table, he noticed the butt of a revolver just projecting from under the pillow. \\nOn the table, which hung on hinges from the for\\'ard bulkhead, were pen and ink, \\nalso a battered log-book. \\n \\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind being caught in a dirty trick,\" Griffiths was saying defiantly. \\n\"I\\'ve been in the tropics too long. I\\'m a sick man, a damn sick man. And the \\nwhiskey, and the sun, and the fever have made me sick in morals, too. Nothing\\'s \\ntoo mean and low for me now, and I can understand why the niggers eat each \\nother, and take heads, and such things. I could do it myself. So I call trying to do \\nyou out of that small account a pretty mild trick. Wisht I could offer you a drink.\" \\n \\nGrief made no reply, and the other busied himself in attempting to unlock a large \\nand much-dented cash-box. From on deck came falsetto cries and the creak and \\nrattle of blocks as the black crew swung up mainsail and driver. Grief watched a \\nlarge cockroach crawling over the greasy paintwork. Griffiths, with an oath of \\nirritation, carried the cash-box to the companion-steps for better light. Here, on \\nhis feet, and bending over the box, his back to his visitor, his hands shot out to \\nthe rifle that stood beside the steps, and at the same moment he whirled about. \\n \\n\"Now don\\'t you move a muscle,\" he commanded. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n10 \\n \\nGrief smiled, elevated his eyebrows quizzically, and obeyed. His left hand rested \\non the bunk beside him; his right hand lay on the table. \\n \\nHis revolver hung on his right hip in plain sight. But in his mind was recollection \\nof the other revolver under the pillow. \\n \\n\"Huh!\" Griffiths sneered. \"You\\'ve got everybody in the Solomons hypnotized, but \\nlet me tell you you ain\\'t got me. Now I\\'m going to throw you off my vessel, along \\nwith your admiralty warrant, but first you\\'ve got to do something. Lift up that log-\\nbook.\" \\n \\nThe other glanced curiously at the log-book, but did not move. \\n \\n\"I tell you I\\'m a sick man, Grief; and I\\'d as soon shoot you as smash a cockroach. \\nLift up that log-book, I say.\" \\n \\nSick he did look, his lean face working nervously with the rage that possessed \\nhim. Grief lifted the book and set it aside. Beneath lay a written sheet of tablet \\npaper. \\n \\n\"Read it,\" Griffiths commanded. \"Read it aloud.\" \\n \\nGrief obeyed; but while he read, the fingers of his left hand began an infinitely \\nslow and patient crawl toward the butt of the weapon under the pillow. \\n \\n\"On board the ketch Willi-Waw, Bombi Bight, Island of Anna, Solomon Islands,\" \\nhe read. \"Know all men by these presents that I do hereby sign off and release in \\nfull, for due value received, all debts whatsoever owing to me by Harrison J. \\nGriffiths, who has this day paid to me twelve hundred pounds sterling.\" \\n \\n\"With that receipt in my hands,\" Griffiths grinned, \"your admiralty warrant\\'s not \\nworth the paper it\\'s written on. Sign it.\" \\n \\n\"It won\\'t do any good, Griffiths,\" Grief said. \"A document signed under \\ncompulsion won\\'t hold before the law.\" \\n \\n\"In that case, what objection have you to signing it then?\" \\n \\n\"Oh, none at all, only that I might save you heaps of trouble by not signing it.\" \\n \\nGrief\\'s fingers had gained the revolver, and, while he talked, with his right hand \\nhe played with the pen and with his left began slowly and imperceptibly drawing \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n11 \\nthe weapon to his side. As his hand finally closed upon it, second finger on trigger \\nand forefinger laid past the cylinder and along the barrel, he wondered what luck \\nhe would have at left-handed snap-shooting. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t consider me,\" Griffiths gibed. \"And just remember Jacobsen will testify that \\nhe saw me pay the money over. Now sign, sign in full, at the bottom, David Grief, \\nand date it.\" \\n \\nFrom on deck came the jar of sheet-blocks and the rat-tat-tat of the reef-points \\nagainst the canvas. In the cabin they could feel the Willi-Waw heel, swing into the \\nwind, and right. David Grief still hesitated. From for\\'ard came the jerking rattle of \\nheadsail halyards through the sheaves. The little vessel heeled, and through the \\ncabin walls came the gurgle and wash of water. \\n \\n\"Get a move on!\" Griffiths cried. \"The anchor\\'s out.\" \\n \\nThe muzzle of the rifle, four feet away, was bearing directly on him, when Grief \\nresolved to act. The rifle wavered as Griffiths kept his balance in the uncertain \\npuffs of the first of the wind. Grief took advantage of the wavering, made as if to \\nsign the paper, and at the same instant, like a cat, exploded into swift and \\nintricate action. As he ducked low and leaped forward with his body, his left hand \\nflashed from under the screen of the table, and so accurately-timed was the \\nsingle stiff pull on the self-cocking trigger that the cartridge discharged as the \\nmuzzle came forward. Not a whit behind was Griffiths. The muzzle of his weapon \\ndropped to meet the ducking body, and, shot at snap direction, rifle and revolver \\nwent off simultaneously. \\n \\nGrief felt the sting and sear of a bullet across the skin of his shoulder, and knew \\nthat his own shot had missed. His forward rush carried him to Griffiths before \\nanother shot could be fired, both of whose arms, still holding the rifle, he locked \\nwith a low tackle about the body. He shoved the revolver muzzle, still in his left \\nhand, deep into the other\\'s abdomen. Under the press of his anger and the sting \\nof his abraded skin, Grief\\'s finger was lifting the hammer, when the wave of anger \\npassed and he recollected himself. Down the companion-way came indignant \\ncries from the Gooma boys in his canoe. \\n \\nEverything was happening in seconds. There was apparently no pause in his \\nactions as he gathered Griffiths in his arms and carried him up the steep steps in \\na sweeping rush. Out into the blinding glare of sunshine he came. A black stood \\ngrinning at the wheel, and the Willi-Waw, heeled over from the wind, was foaming \\nalong. Rapidly dropping astern was his Gooma canoe. Grief turned his head. \\nFrom amidships, revolver in hand, the mate was springing toward him. With two \\njumps, still holding the helpless Griffiths, Grief leaped to the rail and overboard. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n12 \\n \\nBoth men were grappled together as they went down; but Grief, with a quick \\nupdraw of his knees to the other\\'s chest, broke the grip and forced him down. \\nWith both feet on Griffiths\\'s shoulder, he forced him still deeper, at the same time \\ndriving himself to the surface. Scarcely had his head broken into the sunshine \\nwhen two splashes of water, in quick succession and within a foot of his face, \\nadvertised that Jacobsen knew how to handle a revolver. There was a chance for \\nno third shot, for Grief, filling his lungs with air, sank down. Under water he \\nstruck out, nor did he come up till he saw the canoe and the bubbling paddles \\noverhead. As he climbed aboard, the Wlli-Waw went into the wind to come about. \\n \\n\"Washee-washee!\" Grief cried to his boys. \"You fella make-um beach quick fella \\ntime!\" \\n \\nIn all shamelessness, he turned his back on the battle and ran for cover. The \\nWilli-Waw, compelled to deaden way in order to pick up its captain, gave Grief his \\nchance for a lead. The canoe struck the beach full-tilt, with every paddle driving, \\nand they leaped out and ran across the sand for the trees. But before they gained \\nthe shelter, three times the sand kicked into puffs ahead of them. Then they dove \\ninto the green safety of the jungle. \\n \\nGrief watched the Willi-Waw haul up close, go out the passage, then slack its \\nsheets as it headed south with the wind abeam. As it went out of sight past the \\npoint he could see the topsail being broken out. One of the Gooma boys, a black, \\nnearly fifty years of age, hideously marred and scarred by skin diseases and old \\nwounds, looked up into his face and grinned. \\n \\n\"My word,\" the boy commented, \"that fella skipper too much cross along you.\" \\n \\nGrief laughed, and led the way back across the sand to the canoe. \\n \\nIII \\n \\nHow many millions David Grief was worth no man in the Solomons knew, for his \\nholdings and ventures were everywhere in the great South Pacific. From Samoa to \\nNew Guinea and even to the north of the Line his plantations were scattered. He \\npossessed pearling concessions in the Paumotus. Though his name did not \\nappear, he was in truth the German company that traded in the French \\nMarquesas. His trading stations were in strings in all the groups, and his vessels \\nthat operated them were many. He owned atolls so remote and tiny that his \\nsmallest schooners and ketches visited the solitary agents but once a year. \\n \\nIn Sydney, on Castlereagh Street, his offices occupied three floors. But he was \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n13 \\nrarely in those offices. He preferred always to be on the go amongst the islands, \\nnosing out new investments, inspecting and shaking up old ones, and rubbing \\nshoulders with fun and adventure in a thousand strange guises. He bought the \\nwreck of the great steamship Gavonne for a song, and in salving it achieved the \\nimpossible and cleaned up a quarter of a million. In the Louisiades he planted the \\nfirst commercial rubber, and in Bora-Bora he ripped out the South Sea cotton \\nand put the jolly islanders at the work of planting cacao. It was he who took the \\ndeserted island of Lallu-Ka, colonized it with Polynesians from the Ontong-Java \\nAtoll, and planted four thousand acres to cocoanuts. And it was he who \\nreconciled the warring chief-stocks of Tahiti and swung the great deal of the \\nphosphate island of Hikihu. \\n \\nHis own vessels recruited his contract labour. They brought Santa Cruz boys to \\nthe New Hebrides, New Hebrides boys to the Banks, and the head-hunting \\ncannibals of Malaita to the plantations of New Georgia. From Tonga to the \\nGilberts and on to the far Louisiades his recruiters combed the islands for labour. \\nHis keels plowed all ocean stretches. He owned three steamers on regular island \\nruns, though he rarely elected to travel in them, preferring the wilder and more \\nprimitive way of wind and sail. \\n \\nAt least forty years of age, he looked no more than thirty. Yet beachcombers \\nremembered his advent among the islands a score of years before, at which time \\nthe yellow mustache was already budding silkily on his lip. Unlike other white \\nmen in the tropics, he was there because he liked it. His protective skin \\npigmentation was excellent. He had been born to the sun. One he was in ten \\nthousand in the matter of sun-resistance. The invisible and high-velocity light \\nwaves failed to bore into him. Other white men were pervious. The sun drove \\nthrough their skins, ripping and smashing tissues and nerves, till they became \\nsick in mind and body, tossed most of the Decalogue overboard, descended to \\nbeastliness, drank themselves into quick graves, or survived so savagely that war \\nvessels were sometimes sent to curb their license. \\n \\nBut David Grief was a true son of the sun, and he flourished in all its ways. He \\nmerely became browner with the passing of the years, though in the brown was \\nthe hint of golden tint that glows in the skin of the Polynesian. Yet his blue eyes \\nretained their blue, his mustache its yellow, and the lines of his face were those \\nwhich had persisted through the centuries in his English race. English he was in \\nblood, yet those that thought they knew contended he was at least American \\nborn. Unlike them, he had not come out to the South Seas seeking hearth and \\nsaddle of his own. In fact, he had brought hearth and saddle with him. His \\nadvent had been in the Paumotus. He arrived on board a tiny schooner yacht, \\nmaster and owner, a youth questing romance and adventure along the sun-\\nwashed path of the tropics. He also arrived in a hurricane, the giant waves of \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n14 \\nwhich deposited him and yacht and all in the thick of a cocoanut grove three \\nhundred yards beyond the surf. Six months later he was rescued by a pearling \\ncutter. But the sun had got into his blood. At Tahiti, instead of taking a steamer \\nhome, he bought a schooner, outfitted her with trade-goods and divers, and went \\nfor a cruise through the Dangerous Archipelago. \\n \\nAs the golden tint burned into his face it poured molten out of the ends of his \\nfingers. His was the golden touch, but he played the game, not for the gold, but \\nfor the game\\'s sake. It was a man\\'s game, the rough contacts and fierce give and \\ntake of the adventurers of his own blood and of half the bloods of Europe and the \\nrest of the world, and it was a good game; but over and beyond was his love of all \\nthe other things that go to make up a South Seas rover\\'s life--the smell of the \\nreef; the infinite exquisiteness of the shoals of living coral in the mirror-surfaced \\nlagoons; the crashing sunrises of raw colours spread with lawless cunning; the \\npalm-tufted islets set in turquoise deeps; the tonic wine of the trade-winds; the \\nheave and send of the orderly, crested seas; the moving deck beneath his feet, the \\nstraining canvas overhead; the flower-garlanded, golden-glowing men and maids \\nof Polynesia, half-children and half-gods; and even the howling savages of \\nMelanesia, head-hunters and man-eaters, half-devil and all beast. \\n \\nAnd so, favoured child of the sun, out of munificence of energy and sheer joy of \\nliving, he, the man of many millions, forbore on his far way to play the game with \\nHarrison J. Griffiths for a paltry sum. It was his whim, his desire, his expression \\nof self and of the sun-warmth that poured through him. It was fun, a joke, a \\nproblem, a bit of play on which life was lightly hazarded for the joy of the playing. \\n \\nIV \\n \\nThe early morning found the Wonder laying close-hauled along the coast of \\nGuadalcanal She moved lazily through the water under the dying breath of the \\nland breeze. To the east, heavy masses of clouds promised a renewal of the \\nsoutheast trades, accompanied by sharp puffs and rain squalls. Ahead, laying \\nalong the coast on the same course as the Wonder, and being slowly overtaken, \\nwas a small ketch. It was not the Willi-Waw, however, and Captain Ward, on the \\nWonder, putting down his glasses, named it the Kauri. \\n \\nGrief, just on deck from below, sighed regretfully. \\n \\n\"If it had only been the Willi-Waw\" he said. \\n \\n\"You do hate to be beaten,\" Denby, the supercargo, remarked sympathetically. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n15 \\n\"I certainly do.\" Grief paused and laughed with genuine mirth. \"It\\'s my firm \\nconviction that Griffiths is a rogue, and that he treated me quite scurvily \\nyesterday. \\'Sign,\\' he says, \\'sign in full, at the bottom, and date it,\\' And Jacobsen, \\nthe little rat, stood in with him. It was rank piracy, the days of Bully Hayes all \\nover again.\" \\n \\n\"If you weren\\'t my employer, Mr. Grief, I\\'d like to give you a piece of my mind,\" \\nCaptain Ward broke in. \\n \\n\"Go on and spit it out,\" Grief encouraged. \\n \\n\"Well, then--\" The captain hesitated and cleared his throat. \"With all the money \\nyou\\'ve got, only a fool would take the risk you did with those two curs. What do \\nyou do it for?\" \\n \\n\"Honestly, I don\\'t know, Captain. I just want to, I suppose. And can you give any \\nbetter reason for anything you do?\" \\n \\n\"You\\'ll get your bally head shot off some fine day,\" Captain Ward growled in \\nanswer, as he stepped to the binnacle and took the bearing of a peak which had \\njust thrust its head through the clouds that covered Guadalcanar. \\n \\nThe land breeze strengthened in a last effort, and the Wonder, slipping swiftly \\nthrough the water, ranged alongside the Kauri and began to go by. Greetings flew \\nback and forth, then David Grief called out: \\n \\n\"Seen anything of the Willi-Waw?\" \\n \\nThe captain, slouch-hatted and barelegged, with a rolling twist hitched the faded \\nblue lava-lava tighter around his waist and spat tobacco juice overside. \\n \\n\"Sure,\" he answered. \"Griffiths lay at Savo last night, taking on pigs and yams \\nand filling his water-tanks. Looked like he was going for a long cruise, but he said \\nno. Why? Did you want to see him?\" \\n \\n\"Yes; but if you see him first don\\'t tell him you\\'ve seen me.\" \\n \\nThe captain nodded and considered, and walked for\\'ard on his own deck to keep \\nabreast of the faster vessel. \\n \\n\"Say!\" he called. \"Jacobsen told me they were coming down this afternoon to \\nGabera. Said they were going to lay there to-night and take on sweet potatoes.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n16 \\n\"Gabera has the only leading lights in the Solomons,\" Grief said, when his \\nschooner had drawn well ahead. \"Is that right, Captain Ward?\" \\n \\nThe captain nodded. \\n \\n\"And the little bight just around the point on this side, it\\'s a rotten anchorage, \\nisn\\'t it?\" \\n \\n\"No anchorage. All coral patches and shoals, and a bad surf. That\\'s where the \\nMolly went to pieces three years ago.\" \\n \\nGrief stared straight before him with lustreless eyes for a full minute, as if \\nsummoning some vision to his inner sight. Then the corners of his eyes wrinkled \\nand the ends of his yellow mustache lifted in a smile. \\n \\n\"We\\'ll anchor at Gabera,\" he said. \"And run in close to the little bight this side. I \\nwant you to drop me in a whaleboat as you go by. Also, give me six boys, and \\nserve out rifles. I\\'ll be back on board before morning.\" \\n \\nThe captain\\'s face took on an expression of suspicion, which swiftly slid into one \\nof reproach. \\n \\n\"Oh, just a little fun, skipper,\" Grief protested with the apologetic air of a \\nschoolboy caught in mischief by an elder. \\n \\nCaptain Ward grunted, but Denby was all alertness. \\n \\n\"I\\'d like to go along, Mr. Grief,\" he said. \\n \\nGrief nodded consent. \\n \\n\"Bring some axes and bush-knives,\" he said. \"And, oh, by the way, a couple of \\nbright lanterns. See they\\'ve got oil in them.\" \\n \\nV \\n \\nAn hour before sunset the Wonder tore by the little bight. The wind had \\nfreshened, and a lively sea was beginning to make. The shoals toward the beach \\nwere already white with the churn of water, while those farther out as yet showed \\nno more sign than of discoloured water. As the schooner went into the wind and \\nbacked her jib and staysail the whaleboat was swung out. Into it leaped six \\nbreech-clouted Santa Cruz boys, each armed with a rifle. Denby, carrying the \\nlanterns, dropped into the stern-sheets. Grief, following, paused on the rail. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n17 \\n \\n\"Pray for a dark night, skipper,\" he pleaded. \\n \\n\"You\\'ll get it,\" Captain Ward answered. \"There\\'s no moon anyway, and there won\\'t \\nbe any sky. She\\'ll be a bit squally, too.\" \\n \\nThe forecast sent a radiance into Grief\\'s face, making more pronounced the \\ngolden tint of his sunburn. He leaped down beside the supercargo. \\n \\n\"Cast off!\" Captain Ward ordered. \"Draw the headsails! Put your wheel over! \\nThere! Steady! Take that course!\" \\n \\nThe Wonder filled away and ran on around the point for Gabera, while the \\nwhaleboat, pulling six oars and steered by Grief, headed for the beach. With \\nsuperb boatmanship he threaded the narrow, tortuous channel which no craft \\nlarger than a whaleboat could negotiate, until the shoals and patches showed \\nseaward and they grounded on the quiet, rippling beach. \\n \\nThe next hour was filled with work. Moving about among the wild cocoanuts and \\njungle brush, Grief selected the trees. \\n \\n\"Chop this fella tree; chop that fella tree,\" he told his blacks. \"No chop that other \\nfella,\" he said, with a shake of head. \\n \\nIn the end, a wedge-shaped segment of jungle was cleared. Near to the beach \\nremained one long palm. At the apex of the wedge stood another. Darkness was \\nfalling as the lanterns were lighted, carried up the two trees, and made fast. \\n \\n\"That outer lantern is too high.\" David Grief studied it critically. \"Put it down \\nabout ten feet, Denby.\" \\n \\nVI \\n \\nThe Willi-Waw was tearing through the water with a bone in her teeth, for the \\nbreath of the passing squall was still strong. The blacks were swinging up the big \\nmainsail, which had been lowered on the run when the puff was at its height. \\nJacobsen, superintending the operation, ordered them to throw the halyards \\ndown on deck and stand by, then went for\\'ard on the lee-bow and joined Griffiths. \\nBoth men stared with wide-strained eyes at the blank wall of darkness through \\nwhich they were flying, their ears tense for the sound of surf on the invisible \\nshore. It was by this sound that they were for the moment steering. \\n \\nThe wind fell lighter, the scud of clouds thinned and broke, and in the dim \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n18 \\nglimmer of starlight loomed the jungle-clad coast. Ahead, and well on the lee-bow, \\nappeared a jagged rock-point. Both men strained to it. \\n \\n\"Amboy Point,\" Griffiths announced. \"Plenty of water close up. Take the wheel, \\nJacobsen, till we set a course. Get a move on!\" \\n \\nRunning aft, barefooted and barelegged, the rainwater dripping from his scant \\nclothing, the mate displaced the black at the wheel. \\n \\n\"How\\'s she heading?\" Griffiths called. \\n \\n\"South-a-half-west!\" \\n \\n\"Let her come up south-by-west! Got it?\" \\n \\n\"Right on it!\" \\n \\nGriffiths considered the changed relation of Amboy Point to the Willi-Waw\\'s \\ncourse. \\n \\n\"And a-half-west!\" he cried. \\n \\n\"And a-half-west!\" came the answer. \"Right on it!\" \\n \\n\"Steady! That\\'ll do!\" \\n \\n\"Steady she is!\" Jacobsen turned the wheel over to the savage. \"You steer good \\nfella, savve?\" he warned. \"No good fella, I knock your damn black head off.\" \\n \\nAgain he went for\\'ard and joined the other, and again the cloud-scud thickened, \\nthe star-glimmer vanished, and the wind rose and screamed in another squall. \\n \\n\"Watch that mainsail!\" Griffiths yelled in the mate\\'s ear, at the same time \\nstudying the ketch\\'s behaviour. \\n \\nOver she pressed, and lee-rail under, while he measured the weight of the wind \\nand quested its easement. The tepid sea-water, with here and there tiny globules \\nof phosphorescence, washed about his ankles and knees. The wind screamed a \\nhigher note, and every shroud and stay sharply chorused an answer as the Willi-\\nWaw pressed farther over and down. \\n \\n\"Down mainsail!\" Griffiths yelled, springing to the peak-halyards, thrusting away \\nthe black who held on, and casting off the turn. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n19 \\n \\nJacobsen, at the throat-halyards, was performing the like office. The big sail \\nrattled down, and the blacks, with shouts and yells, threw themselves on the \\nbattling canvas. The mate, finding one skulking in the darkness, flung his \\nbunched knuckles into the creature\\'s face and drove him to his work. \\n \\nThe squall held at its high pitch, and under her small canvas the Willi-Waw still \\nfoamed along. Again the two men stood for\\'ard and vainly watched in the \\nhorizontal drive of rain. \\n \\n\"We\\'re all right,\" Griffiths said. \"This rain won\\'t last. We can hold this course till \\nwe pick up the lights. Anchor in thirteen fathoms. You\\'d better overhaul forty-five \\non a night like this. After that get the gaskets on the mainsail. We won\\'t need it.\" \\n \\nHalf an hour afterward his weary eyes were rewarded by a glimpse of two lights. \\n \\n\"There they are, Jacobsen. I\\'ll take the wheel. Run down the fore-staysail and \\nstand by to let go. Make the niggers jump.\" \\n \\nAft, the spokes of the wheel in his hands, Griffiths held the course till the two \\nlights came in line, when he abruptly altered and headed directly in for them. He \\nheard the tumble and roar of the surf, but decided it was farther away--as it \\nshould be, at Gabera. \\n \\nHe heard the frightened cry of the mate, and was grinding the wheel down with \\nall his might, when the Willi-Waw struck. At the same instant her mainmast \\ncrashed over the bow. Five wild minutes followed. All hands held on while the \\nhull upheaved and smashed down on the brittle coral and the warm seas swept \\nover them. Grinding and crunching, the Willi-Waw worked itself clear over the \\nshoal patch and came solidly to rest in the comparatively smooth and shallow \\nchannel beyond. \\n \\nGriffiths sat down on the edge of the cabin, head bowed on chest, in silent wrath \\nand bitterness. Once he lifted his face to glare at the two white lights, one above \\nthe other and perfectly in line. \\n \\n\"There they are,\" he said. \"And this isn\\'t Gabera. Then what the hell is it?\" \\n \\nThough the surf still roared and across the shoal flung its spray and upper wash \\nover them, the wind died down and the stars came out. Shoreward came the \\nsound of oars. \\n \\n\"What have you had?--an earthquake?\" Griffiths called out. \"The bottom\\'s all \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n20 \\nchanged. I\\'ve anchored here a hundred times in thirteen fathoms. Is that you, \\nWilson?\" \\n \\nA whaleboat came alongside, and a man climbed over the rail. In the faint light \\nGriffiths found an automatic Colt\\'s thrust into his face, and, looking up, saw \\nDavid Grief. \\n \\n\"No, you never anchored here before,\" Grief laughed. \"Gabera\\'s just around the \\npoint, where I\\'ll be as soon as I\\'ve collected that little sum of twelve hundred \\npounds. We won\\'t bother for the receipt. I\\'ve your note here, and I\\'ll just return \\nit.\" \\n \\n\"You did this!\" Griffiths cried, springing to his feet in a sudden gust of rage. \"You \\nfaked those leading lights! You\\'ve wrecked me, and by--\" \\n \\n\"Steady! Steady!\" Grief\\'s voice was cool and menacing. \"I\\'ll trouble you for that \\ntwelve hundred, please.\" \\n \\nTo Griffiths, a vast impotence seemed to descend upon him. He was overwhelmed \\nby a profound disgust--disgust for the sunlands and the sun-sickness, for the \\nfutility of all his endeavour, for this blue-eyed, golden-tinted, superior man who \\ndefeated him on all his ways. \\n \\n\"Jacobsen,\" he said, \"will you open the cash-box and pay this--this bloodsucker--\\ntwelve hundred pounds?\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n21 \\n \\nChapter Two--THE PROUD GOAT OF ALOYSIUS PANKBURN \\n \\n I \\n \\nQuick eye that he had for the promise of adventure, prepared always for the \\nunexpected to leap out at him from behind the nearest cocoanut tree, \\nnevertheless David Grief received no warning when he laid eyes on Aloysius \\nPankburn. It was on the little steamer Berthe. Leaving his schooner to follow, \\nGrief had taken passage for the short run across from Raiatea to Papeete. When \\nhe first saw Aloysius Pankburn, that somewhat fuddled gentleman was drinking a \\nlonely cocktail at the tiny bar between decks next to the barber shop. And when \\nGrief left the barber\\'s hands half an hour later Aloysius Pankburn was still \\nhanging over the bar still drinking by himself. \\n \\nNow it is not good for man to drink alone, and Grief threw sharp scrutiny into his \\npass-ing glance. He saw a well-built young man of thirty, well-featured, well-\\ndressed, and evidently, in the world\\'s catalogue, a gentleman. But in the faint \\nhint of slovenliness, in the shaking, eager hand that spilled the liquor, and in the \\nnervous, vacillating eyes, Grief read the unmistakable marks of the chronic \\nalcoholic. \\n \\nAfter dinner he chanced upon Pankburn again. This time it was on deck, and the \\nyoung man, clinging to the rail and peering into the distance at the dim forms of \\na man and woman in two steamer chairs drawn closely together, was crying, \\ndrunkenly. Grief noted that the man\\'s arm was around the woman\\'s waist. \\nAloysius Pankburn looked on and cried. \\n \\n\"Nothing to weep about,\" Grief said genially. \\n \\nPankburn looked at him, and gushed tears of profound self-pity. \\n \\n\"It\\'s hard,\" he sobbed. \"Hard. Hard. That man\\'s my business manager. I employ \\nhim. I pay him a good screw. And that\\'s how he earns it.\" \\n \\n\"In that case, why don\\'t you put a stop to it?\" Grief advised. \\n \\n\"I can\\'t. She\\'d shut off my whiskey. She\\'s my trained nurse.\" \\n \\n\"Fire her, then, and drink your head off.\" \\n \\n\"I can\\'t. He\\'s got all my money. If I did, he wouldn\\'t give me sixpence to buy a \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n22 \\ndrink with.\" \\n \\nThis woful possibility brought a fresh wash of tears. Grief was interested. Of all \\nunique situations he could never have imagined such a one as this. \\n \\n\"They were engaged to take care of me,\" Pankburn was blubbering, \"to keep me \\naway from the drink. And that\\'s the way they do it, lollygagging all about the ship \\nand letting me drink myself to death. It isn\\'t right, I tell you. It isn\\'t right. They \\nwere sent along with me for the express purpose of not letting me drink, and they \\nlet me drink to swinishness as long as I leave them alone. If I complain they \\nthreaten not to let me have another drop. What can a poor devil do? My death will \\nbe on their heads, that\\'s all. Come on down and join me.\" \\n \\nHe released his clutch on the rail, and would have fallen had Grief not caught his \\narm. He seemed to undergo a transformation, to stiffen physically, to thrust his \\nchin forward aggressively, and to glint harshly in his eyes. \\n \\n\"I won\\'t let them kill me. And they\\'ll be sorry. I\\'ve offered them fifty thousand--\\nlater on, of course. They laughed. They don\\'t know. But I know.\" He fumbled in \\nhis coat pocket and drew forth an object that flashed in the faint light. \"They \\ndon\\'t know the meaning of that. But I do.\" He looked at Grief with abrupt \\nsuspicion. \"What do you make out of it, eh? What do you make out of it?\" \\n \\nDavid Grief caught a swift vision of an alcoholic degenerate putting a very loving \\nyoung couple to death with a copper spike, for a copper spike was what he held in \\nhis hand, an evident old-fashioned ship-fastening. \\n \\n\"My mother thinks I\\'m up here to get cured of the booze habit. She doesn\\'t know. \\nI bribed the doctor to prescribe a voyage. When we get to Papeete my manager is \\ngoing to charter a schooner and away we\\'ll sail. But they don\\'t dream. They think \\nit\\'s the booze. I know. I only know. Good night, sir. I\\'m going to bed--unless--er--\\nyou\\'ll join me in a night cap. One last drink, you know.\" \\n \\nII \\n \\nIn the week that followed at Papeete Grief caught numerous and bizarre glimpses \\nof Aloysius Pankburn. So did everybody else in the little island capital; for neither \\nthe beach nor Lavina\\'s boarding house had been so scandalized in years. In \\nmidday, bareheaded, clad only in swimming trunks, Aloysius Pankburn ran down \\nthe main street from Lavina\\'s to the water front. He put on the gloves with a \\nfireman from the Berthe in a scheduled four-round bout at the Folies Bergères, \\nand was knocked out in the second round. He tried insanely to drown himself in \\na two-foot pool of water, dived drunkenly and splendidly from fifty feet up in the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n23 \\nrigging of the Mariposa lying at the wharf, and chartered the cutter Toerau at \\nmore than her purchase price and was only saved by his manager\\'s refusal \\nfinancially to ratify the agreement. He bought out the old blind leper at the \\nmarket, and sold breadfruit, plantains, and sweet potatoes at such cut-rates that \\nthe gendarmes were called out to break the rush of bargain-hunting natives. For \\nthat matter, three times the gendarmes arrested him for riotous behaviour, and \\nthree times his manager ceased from love-making long enough to pay the fines \\nimposed by a needy colonial administration. \\n \\nThen the Mariposa sailed for San Francisco, and in the bridal suite were the \\nmanager and the trained nurse, fresh-married. Before departing, the manager \\nhad thoughtfully bestowed eight five-pound banknotes on Aloysius, with the \\nforeseen result that Aloysius awoke several days later to find himself broke and \\nperilously near to delirium tremens. Lavina, famed for her good heart even among \\nthe driftage of South Pacific rogues and scamps, nursed him around and never let \\nit filter into his returning intelligence that there was neither manager nor money \\nto pay his board. \\n \\nIt was several evenings after this that David Grief, lounging under the after deck \\nawning of the Kittiwake and idly scanning the meagre columns of the Papeete \\nAvant-Coureur, sat suddenly up and almost rubbed his eyes. It was unbelievable, \\nbut there it was. The old South Seas Romance was not dead. He read: \\n \\n     WANTED--To exchange a half interest in buried treasure,      worth five million \\nfrancs, for transportation for one to an      unknown island in the Pacific and \\nfacilities for carrying      away the loot.   Ask for FOLLY, at Lavina\\'s. \\n \\nGrief looked at his watch. It was early yet, only eight o\\'clock. \\n \\n\"Mr. Carlsen,\" he called in the direction of a glowing pipe. \"Get the crew for the \\nwhale-boat. I\\'m going ashore.\" \\n \\nThe husky voice of the Norwegian mate was raised for\\'ard, and half a dozen \\nstrapping Rapa Islanders ceased their singing and manned the boat. \\n \\n\"I came to see Folly, Mr. Folly, I imagine,\" David Grief told Lavina. \\n \\nHe noted the quick interest in her eyes as she turned her head and flung a \\ncommand in native across two open rooms to the outstanding kitchen. A few \\nminutes later a barefooted native girl padded in and shook her head. \\n \\nLavina\\'s disappointment was evident. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n24 \\n\"You\\'re stopping aboard the Kittiwake, aren\\'t you?\" she said. \"I\\'ll tell him you \\ncalled.\" \\n \\n\"Then it is a he?\" Grief queried. \\n \\nLavina nodded. \\n \\n\"I hope you can do something for him, Captain Grief. I\\'m only a good-natured \\nwoman. I don\\'t know. But he\\'s a likable man, and he may be telling the truth; I \\ndon\\'t know. You\\'ll know. You\\'re not a soft-hearted fool like me. Can\\'t I mix you a \\ncocktail?\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nBack on board his schooner and dozing in a deck chair under a three-months-old \\nmagazine, David Grief was aroused by a sobbing, slubbering noise from overside. \\nHe opened his eyes. From the Chilian cruiser, a quarter of a mile away, came the \\nstroke of eight bells. It was midnight. From overside came a splash and another \\nslubbering noise. To him it seemed half amphibian, half the sounds of a man \\ncrying to himself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe. \\n \\nA jump took David Grief to the low rail. Beneath, centred about the slubbering \\nnoise, was an area of agitated phosphorescence. Leaning over, he locked his hand \\nunder the armpit of a man, and, with pull and heave and quick-changing grips, \\nhe drew on deck the naked form of Aloysius Pankburn. \\n \\n\"I didn\\'t have a sou-markee,\" he complained. \"I had to swim it, and I couldn\\'t find \\nyour gangway. It was very miserable. Pardon me. If you have a towel to put about \\nmy middle, and a good stiff drink, I\\'ll be more myself. I\\'m Mr. Folly, and you\\'re \\nthe Captain Grief, I presume, who called on me when I was out. No, I\\'m not \\ndrunk. Nor am I cold. This isn\\'t shivering. Lavina allowed me only two drinks to-\\nday. I\\'m on the edge of the horrors, that\\'s all, and I was beginning to see things \\nwhen I couldn\\'t find the gangway. If you\\'ll take me below I\\'ll be very grateful. You \\nare the only one that answered my advertisement.\" \\n \\nHe was shaking pitiably in the warm night, and down in the cabin, before he got \\nhis towel, Grief saw to it that a half-tumbler of whiskey was in his hand. \\n \\n\"Now fire ahead,\" Grief said, when he had got his guest into a shirt and a pair of \\nduck trousers. \"What\\'s this advertisement of yours? I\\'m listening.\" \\n \\nPankburn looked at the whiskey bottle, but Grief shook his head. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n25 \\n\"All right, Captain, though I tell you on whatever is left of my honour that I am \\nnot drunk--not in the least. Also, what I shall tell you is true, and I shall tell it \\nbriefly, for it is clear to me that you are a man of affairs and action. Likewise, \\nyour chemistry is good. To you alcohol has never been a million maggots gnawing \\nat every cell of you. You\\'ve never been to hell. I am there now. I am scorching. \\nNow listen. \\n \\n\"My mother is alive. She is English. I was born in Australia. I was educated at \\nYork and Yale. I am a master of arts, a doctor of philosophy, and I am no good. \\nFurthermore, I am an alcoholic.

I have done thirty miles in \\na rough sea. I have another record. I have punished more whiskey than any man \\nof my years. I will steal sixpence from you for the price of a drink. Finally, I will \\ntell you the truth. \\n \\n\"My father was an American--an Annapolis man. He was a midshipman in the \\nWar of the Rebellion. In \\'66 he was a lieutenant on the Suwanee. Her captain was \\nPaul Shirley. In \\'66 the Suwanee coaled at an island in the Pacific which I do not \\ncare to mention, under a protectorate which did not exist then and which shall be \\nnameless. Ashore, behind the bar of a public house, my father saw three copper \\nspikes--ship\\'s spikes.\" \\n \\nDavid Grief smiled quietly. \\n \\n\"And now I can tell you the name of the coaling station and of the protectorate \\nthat came afterward,\" he said. \\n \\n\"And of the three spikes?\" Pankburn asked with equal quietness. \"Go ahead, for \\nthey are in my possession now.\" \\n \\n\"Certainly. They were behind German Oscar\\'s bar at Peenoo-Peenee. Johnny \\nBlack brought them there from off his schooner the night he died. He was just \\nback from a long cruise to the westward, fishing beche-de-mer and sandalwood \\ntrading. All the beach knows the tale.\" \\n \\nPankburn shook his head. \\n \\n\"Go on,\" he urged. \\n \\n\"It was before my time, of course,\" Grief explained. \"I only tell what I\\'ve heard. \\nNext came the Ecuadoran cruiser, of all directions, in from the westward, and \\nbound home. Her officers recognized the spikes. Johnny Black was dead. They \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n26 \\ngot hold of his mate and logbook. Away to the westward went she. Six months \\nafter, again bound home, she dropped in at Peenoo-Peenee. She had failed, and \\nthe tale leaked out.\" \\n \\n\"When the revolutionists were marching on Guayaquil,\" Pankburn took it up, \"the \\nfederal officers, believing a defence of the city hopeless, salted down the \\ngovernment treasure chest, something like a million dollars gold, but all in \\nEnglish coinage, and put it on board the American schooner Flirt. They were \\ngoing to run at daylight. The American captain skinned out in the middle of the \\nnight. Go on.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s an old story,\" Grief resumed. \"There was no other vessel in the harbour. The \\nfederal leaders couldn\\'t run. They put their backs to the wall and held the city. \\nRohjas Salced, making a forced march from Quito, raised the siege. The \\nrevolution was broken, and the one ancient steamer that constituted the \\nEcuadoran navy was sent in pursuit of the Flirt. They caught her, between the \\nBanks Group and the New Hebrides, hove to and flying distress signals. The \\ncaptain had died the day before--blackwater fever.\" \\n \\n\"And the mate?\" Pankburn challenged. \\n \\n\"The mate had been killed a week earlier by the natives on one of the Banks, \\nwhen they sent a boat in for water. There were no navigators left. The men were \\nput to the torture. It was beyond international law. They wanted to confess, but \\ncouldn\\'t. They told of the three spikes in the trees on the beach, but where the \\nisland was they did not know. To the westward, far to the westward, was all they \\nknew. The tale now goes two ways. One is that they all died under the torture. \\nThe other is that the survivors were swung at the yardarm. At any rate, the \\nEcuadoran cruiser went home without the treasure. Johnny Black brought the \\nthree spikes to Peenoo-Peenee, and left them at German Oscar\\'s, but how and \\nwhere he found them he never told.\" \\n \\nPankburn looked hard at the whiskey bottle. \\n \\n\"Just two fingers,\" he whimpered. \\n \\nGrief considered, and poured a meagre drink. Pankburn\\'s eyes sparkled, and he \\ntook new lease of life. \\n \\n\"And this is where I come in with the missing details,\" he said. \"Johnny Black did \\ntell. He told my father. Wrote him from Levuka, before he came on to die at \\nPeenoo-Peenee. My father had saved his life one rough-house night in Valparaiso. \\nA Chink pearler, out of Thursday Island, prospecting for new grounds to the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n27 \\nnorth of New Guinea, traded for the three spikes with a nigger. Johnny Black \\nbought them for copper weight. He didn\\'t dream any more than the Chink, but \\ncoming back he stopped for hawksbill turtle at the very beach where you say the \\nmate of the Flirt was killed. Only he wasn\\'t killed. The Banks Islanders held him \\nprisoner, and he was dying of necrosis of the jawbone, caused by an arrow wound \\nin the fight on the beach. Before he died he told the yarn to Johnny Black. \\nJohnny Black wrote my father from Levuka. He was at the end of his rope--\\ncancer. My father, ten years afterward, when captain of the Perry, got the spikes \\nfrom German Oscar. And from my father, last will and testament, you know, \\ncame the spikes and the data. I have the island, the latitude and longitude of the \\nbeach where the three spikes were nailed in the trees. The spikes are up at \\nLavina\\'s now. The latitude and longitude are in my head. Now what do you \\nthink?\" \\n \\n\"Fishy,\" was Grief\\'s instant judgment. \"Why didn\\'t your father go and get it \\nhimself?\" \\n \\n\"Didn\\'t need it. An uncle died and left him a fortune. He retired from the navy, \\nran foul of an epidemic of trained nurses in Boston, and my mother got a divorce. \\nAlso, she fell heir to an income of something like thirty thousand dollars, and \\nwent to live in New Zealand. I was divided between them, half-time New Zealand, \\nhalf-time United States, until my father\\'s death last year. Now my mother has me \\naltogether. He left me his money--oh, a couple of millions--but my mother has \\nhad guardians appointed on account of the drink. I\\'m worth all kinds of money, \\nbut I can\\'t touch a penny save what is doled out to me. But the old man, who had \\ngot the tip on my drinking, left me the three spikes and the data thereunto \\npertaining. Did it through his lawyers, unknown to my mother; said it beat life \\ninsurance, and that if I had the backbone to go and get it I could drink my back \\nteeth awash until I died. Millions in the hands of my guardians, slathers of \\nshekels of my mother\\'s that\\'ll be mine if she beats me to the crematory, another \\nmillion waiting to be dug up, and in the meantime I\\'m cadging on Lavina for two \\ndrinks a day. It\\'s hell, isn\\'t it?--when you consider my thirst.\" \\n \\n\"Where\\'s the island?\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s a long way from here.\" \\n \\n\"Name it.\" \\n \\n\"Not on your life, Captain Grief. You\\'re making an easy half-million out of this. \\nYou will sail under my directions, and when we\\'re well to sea and on our way I\\'ll \\ntell you and not before.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n28 \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders, dismissing the subject. \\n \\n\"When I\\'ve given you another drink I\\'ll send the boat ashore with you,\" he said. \\n \\nPankburn was taken aback. For at least five minutes he debated with himself, \\nthen licked his lips and surrendered. \\n \\n\"If you promise to go, I\\'ll tell you now.\" \\n \\n\"Of course I\\'m willing to go. That\\'s why I asked you. Name the island.\" \\n \\nPankburn looked at the bottle. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll take that drink now, Captain.\" \\n \\n\"No you won\\'t. That drink was for you if you went ashore. If you are going to tell \\nme the island, you must do it in your sober senses.\" \\n \\n\"Francis Island, if you will have it. Bougainville named it Barbour Island.\" \\n \\n\"Off there all by its lonely in the Little Coral Sea,\" Grief said. \"I know it. Lies \\nbetween New Ireland and New Guinea. A rotten hole now, though it was all right \\nwhen the Flirt drove in the spikes and the Chink pearler traded for them. The \\nsteamship Castor, recruiting labour for the Upolu plantations, was cut off there \\nwith all hands two years ago. I knew her captain well. The Germans sent a \\ncruiser, shelled the bush, burned half a dozen villages, killed a couple of niggers \\nand a lot of pigs, and--and that was all. The niggers always were bad there, but \\nthey turned really bad forty years ago. That was when they cut off a whaler. Let \\nme see? What was her name?\" \\n \\nHe stepped to the bookshelf, drew out the bulky \"South Pacific Directory,\" and \\nran through its pages. \\n \\n\"Yes. Here it is. Francis, or Barbour,\" he skimmed. \"Natives warlike and \\ntreacherous--Melanesian--cannibals. Whaleship Western cut off--that was her \\nname. Shoals--points--anchorages--ah, Redscar, Owen Bay, Likikili Bay, that\\'s \\nmore like it; deep indentation, mangrove swamps, good holding in nine fathoms \\nwhen white scar in bluff bears west-southwest.\" Grief looked up. \"That\\'s your \\nbeach, Pankburn, I\\'ll swear.\" \\n \\n\"Will you go?\" the other demanded eagerly. \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n29 \\n \\n\"It sounds good to me. Now if the story had been of a hundred millions, or some \\nsuch crazy sum, I wouldn\\'t look at it for a moment. We\\'ll sail to-morrow, but \\nunder one consideration. You are to be absolutely under my orders.\" \\n \\nHis visitor nodded emphatically and joyously. \\n \\n\"And that means no drink.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s pretty hard,\" Pankburn whined. \\n \\n\"It\\'s my terms. I\\'m enough of a doctor to see you don\\'t come to harm. And you are \\nto work--hard work, sailor\\'s work. You\\'ll stand regular watches and everything, \\nthough you eat and sleep aft with us.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s a go.\" Pankburn put out his hand to ratify the agreement. \"If it doesn\\'t kill \\nme,\" he added. \\n \\nDavid Grief poured a generous three-fingers into the tumbler and extended it. \\n \\n\"Then here\\'s your last drink. Take it.\" \\n \\nPankburn\\'s hand went halfway out. With a sudden spasm of resolution, he \\nhesitated, threw back his shoulders, and straightened up his head. \\n \\n\"I guess I won\\'t,\" he began, then, feebly surrendering to the gnaw of desire, he \\nreached hastily for the glass, as if in fear that it would be withdrawn.  \\nIV \\n \\nIt is a long traverse from Papeete in the Societies to the Little Coral Sea--from 100 \\nwest longitude to 150 east longitude--as the crow flies the equivalent to a voyage \\nacross the Atlantic. But the Kittiwake did not go as the crow flies. David Grief\\'s \\nnumerous interests diverted her course many times. He stopped to take a look-in \\nat uninhabited Rose Island with an eye to colonizing and planting cocoa-nuts. \\nNext, he paid his respects to Tui Manua, of Eastern Samoa, and opened an \\nintrigue for a share of the trade monopoly of that dying king\\'s three islands. From \\nApia he carried several relief agents and a load of trade goods to the Gilberts. He \\npeeped in at Ontong-Java Atoll, inspected his plantations on Ysabel, and \\npurchased lands from the salt-water chiefs of northwestern Malaita. And all along \\nthis devious way he made a man of Aloysius Pankburn. \\n \\nThat thirster, though he lived aft, was compelled to do the work of a common \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n30 \\nsailor. And not only did he take his wheel and lookout, and heave on sheets and \\ntackles, but the dirtiest and most arduous tasks were appointed him. Swung aloft \\nin a bosun\\'s chair, he scraped the masts and slushed down. Holystoning the deck \\nor scrubbing it with fresh limes made his back ache and developed the wasted, \\nflabby muscles. When the Kittiwake lay at anchor and her copper bottom was \\nscrubbed with cocoa-nut husks by the native crew, who dived and did it under \\nwater, Pankburn was sent down on his shift and as many times as any on the \\nshift. \\n \\n\"Look at yourself,\" Grief said. \"You are twice the man you were when you came on \\nboard. You haven\\'t had one drink, you didn\\'t die, and the poison is pretty well \\nworked out of you. It\\'s the work. It beats trained nurses and business managers. \\nHere, if you\\'re thirsty. Clap your lips to this.\" \\n \\nWith several deft strokes of his heavy-backed sheath-knife, Grief clipped a \\ntriangular piece of shell from the end of a husked drinking-cocoa-nut. The thin, \\ncool liquid, slightly milky and effervescent, bubbled to the brim. With a bow, \\nPankburn took the natural cup, threw his head back, and held it back till the \\nshell was empty. He drank many of these nuts each day. The black steward, a \\nNew Hebrides boy sixty years of age, and his assistant, a Lark Islander of eleven, \\nsaw to it that he was continually supplied. \\n \\nPankburn did not object to the hard work. He devoured work, never shirking and \\nalways beating the native sailors in jumping to obey a command. But his \\nsufferings during the period of driving the alcohol out of his system were truly \\nheroic. Even when the last shred of the poison was exuded, the desire, as an \\nobsession, remained in his head. So it was, when, on his honour, he went ashore \\nat Apia, that he attempted to put the public houses out of business by drinking \\nup their stocks in trade. And so it was, at two in the morning, that David Grief \\nfound him in front of the Tivoli, out of which he had been disorderly thrown by \\nCharley Roberts. Aloysius, as of old, was chanting his sorrows to the stars. Also, \\nand more concretely, he was punctuating the rhythm with cobbles of coral stone, \\nwhich he flung with amazing accuracy through Charley Roberts\\'s windows. \\n \\nDavid Grief took him away, but not till next morning did he take him in hand. It \\nwas on the deck of the Kittiwake, and there was nothing kindergarten about it. \\nGrief struck him, with bare knuckles, punched him and punished him--gave him \\nthe worst thrashing he had ever received. \\n \\n\"For the good of your soul, Pankburn,\" was the way he emphasized his blows. \\n\"For the good of your mother. For the progeny that will come after. For the good of \\nthe world, and the universe, and the whole race of man yet to be. And now, to \\nhammer the lesson home, we\\'ll do it all over again. That, for the good of your \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n31 \\nsoul; and that, for your mother\\'s sake; and that, for the little children, \\nundreamed of and unborn, whose mother you\\'ll love for their sakes, and for love\\'s \\nsake, in the lease of manhood that will be yours when I am done with you. Come \\non and take your medicine. I\\'m not done with you yet. I\\'ve only begun. There are \\nmany other reasons which I shall now proceed to expound.\" The brown sailors \\nand the black stewards and cook looked on and grinned. Far from them was the \\nquestioning of any of the mysterious and incomprehensible ways of white men. As \\nfor Carlsen, the mate, he was grimly in accord with the treatment his employer \\nwas administering; while Albright, the supercargo, merely played with his \\nmustache and smiled. They were men of the sea. They lived life in the rough. And \\nalcohol, in themselves as well as in other men, was a problem they had learned to \\nhandle in ways not taught in doctors\\' schools. \\n \\n\"Boy! A bucket of fresh water and a towel,\" Grief ordered, when he had finished. \\n\"Two buckets and two towels,\" he added, as he surveyed his own hands. \\n \\n\"You\\'re a pretty one,\" he said to Pankburn. \"You\\'ve spoiled everything. I had the \\npoison completely out of you. And now you are fairly reeking with it. We\\'ve got to \\nbegin all over again. Mr. Albright! You know that pile of old chain on the beach at \\nthe boat-landing. Find the owner, buy it, and fetch it on board. There must be a \\nhundred and fifty fathoms of it. Pankburn! To-morrow morning you start in \\npounding the rust off of it. When you\\'ve done that, you\\'ll sandpaper it. Then you\\'ll \\npaint it. And nothing else will you do till that chain is as smooth as new.\" \\n \\nAloysius Pankburn shook his head. \\n \\n\"I quit. Francis Island can go to hell for all of me. I\\'m done with your slave-\\ndriving. Kindly put me ashore at once. I\\'m a white man. You can\\'t treat me this \\nway.\" \\n \\n\"Mr. Carlsen, you will see that Mr. Pankburn remains on board.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ll have you broken for this!\" Aloysius screamed. \"You can\\'t stop me.\" \\n \\n\"I can give you another licking,\" Grief answered. \"And let me tell you one thing, \\nyou besotted whelp, I\\'ll keep on licking you as long as my knuckles hold out or \\nuntil you yearn to hammer chain rust. I\\'ve taken you in hand, and I\\'m going to \\nmake a man out of you if I have to kill you to do it. Now go below and change \\nyour clothes. Be ready to turn to with a hammer this afternoon. Mr. Albright, get \\nthat chain aboard pronto. Mr. Carlsen, send the boats ashore after it. Also, keep \\nyour eye on Pankburn. If he shows signs of keeling over or going into the shakes, \\ngive him a nip--a small one. He may need it after last night.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n32 \\nV \\n \\nFor the rest of the time the Kittiwake lay in Apia Aloysius Pankburn pounded \\nchain rust. Ten hours a day he pounded. And on the long stretch across to the \\nGilberts he still pounded. \\n \\nThen came the sandpapering. One hundred and fifty fathoms is nine hundred \\nfeet, and every link of all that length was smoothed and polished as no link ever \\nwas before. And when the last link had received its second coat of black paint, he \\ndeclared himself. \\n \\n\"Come on with more dirty work,\" he told Grief. \"I\\'ll overhaul the other chains if \\nyou say so. And you needn\\'t worry about me any more. I\\'m not going to take \\nanother drop. I\\'m going to train up. You got my proud goat when you beat me, \\nbut let me tell you, you only got it temporarily. Train! I\\'m going to train till I\\'m as \\nhard all the way through, and clean all the way through, as that chain is. And \\nsome day, Mister David Grief, somewhere, somehow, I\\'m going to be in such \\nshape that I\\'ll lick you as you licked me. I\\'m going to pulp your face till your own \\nniggers won\\'t know you.\" \\n \\nGrief was jubilant. \\n \\n\"Now you\\'re talking like a man,\" he cried. \"The only way you\\'ll ever lick me is to \\nbecome a man. And then, maybe--\" \\n \\nHe paused in the hope that the other would catch the suggestion. Aloysius groped \\nfor it, and, abruptly, something akin to illumination shone in his eyes. \\n \\n\"And then I won\\'t want to, you mean?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"And that\\'s the curse of it,\" Aloysius lamented. \"I really believe I won\\'t want to. I \\nsee the point. But I\\'m going to go right on and shape myself up just the same.\" \\n \\nThe warm, sunburn glow in Grief\\'s face seemed to grow warmer. His hand went \\nout. \\n \\n\"Pankburn, I love you right now for that.\" \\n \\nAloysius grasped the hand, and shook his head in sad sincerity. \\n \\n\"Grief,\" he mourned, \"you\\'ve got my goat, you\\'ve got my proud goat, and you\\'ve \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n33 \\ngot it permanently, I\\'m afraid.\" \\n \\nVI \\n \\nOn a sultry tropic day, when the last flicker of the far southeast trade was fading \\nout and the seasonal change for the northwest monsoon was coming on, the \\nKittiwake lifted above the sea-rim the jungle-clad coast of Francis Island. \\n \\nGrief, with compass bearings and binoculars, identified the volcano that marked \\nRedscar, ran past Owen Bay, and lost the last of the breeze at the entrance to \\nLikikili Bay. With the two whaleboats out and towing, and with Carl-sen heaving \\nthe lead, the Kittiwake sluggishly entered a deep and narrow indentation. There \\nwere no beaches. The mangroves began at the water\\'s edge, and behind them rose \\nsteep jungle, broken here and there by jagged peaks of rock. At the end of a mile, \\nwhen the white scar on the bluff bore west-southwest, the lead vindicated the \\n\"Directory,\" and the anchor rumbled down in nine fathoms. \\n \\nFor the rest of that day and until the afternoon of the day following they remained \\non the Kittiwake and waited. No canoes appeared. There were no signs of human \\nlife. Save for the occasional splash of a fish or the screaming of cockatoos, there \\nseemed no other life. Once, however, a huge butterfly, twelve inches from tip to \\ntip, fluttered high over their mastheads and drifted across to the opposing jungle. \\n \\n\"There\\'s no use in sending a boat in to be cut up,\" Grief said. \\n \\nPankburn was incredulous, and volunteered to go in alone, to swim it if he \\ncouldn\\'t borrow the dingey. \\n \\n\"They haven\\'t forgotten the German cruiser,\" Grief explained. \"And I\\'ll wager that \\nbush is alive with men right now. What do you think, Mr. Carlsen?\" \\n \\nThat veteran adventurer of the islands was emphatic in his agreement. \\n \\nIn the late afternoon of the second day Grief ordered a whaleboat into the water. \\nHe took his place in the bow, a live cigarette in his mouth and a short-fused stick \\nof dynamite in his hand, for he was bent on shooting a mess of fish. Along the \\nthwarts half a dozen Winchesters were placed. Albright, who took the steering-\\nsweep, had a Mauser within reach of hand. They pulled in and along the green \\nwall of vegetation. At times they rested on the oars in the midst of a profound \\nsilence. \\n \\n\"Two to one the bush is swarming with them--in quids,\" Albright whispered. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n34 \\nPankburn listened a moment longer and took the bet. Five minutes later they \\nsighted a school of mullet. The brown rowers held their oars. Grief touched the \\nshort fuse to his cigarette and threw the stick. So short was the fuse that the \\nstick exploded in the instant after it struck the water. And in that same instant \\nthe bush exploded into life. There were wild yells of defiance, and black and \\nnaked bodies leaped forward like apes through the mangroves. \\n \\nIn the whaleboat every rifle was lifted. Then came the wait. A hundred blacks, \\nsome few armed with ancient Sniders, but the greater portion armed with \\ntomahawks, fire-hardened spears, and bone-tipped arrows, clustered on the roots \\nthat rose out of the bay. No word was spoken. Each party watched the other \\nacross twenty feet of water. An old, one-eyed black, with a bristly face, rested a \\nSnider on his hip, the muzzle directed at Albright, who, in turn, covered him back \\nwith the Mauser. A couple of minutes of this tableau endured. The stricken fish \\nrose to the surface or struggled half-stunned in the clear depths. \\n \\n\"It\\'s all right, boys,\" Grief said quietly. \"Put down your guns and over the side \\nwith you. Mr. Albright, toss the tobacco to that one-eyed brute.\" \\n \\nWhile the Rapa men dived for the fish, Albright threw a bundle of trade tobacco \\nashore. The one-eyed man nodded his head and writhed his features in an \\nattempt at amiability. Weapons were lowered, bows unbent, and arrows put back \\nin their quivers. \\n \\n\"They know tobacco,\" Grief announced, as they rowed back aboard. \"We\\'ll have \\nvisitors. You\\'ll break out a case of tobacco, Mr. Albright, and a few trade-knives. \\nThere\\'s a canoe now.\" \\n \\nOld One-Eye, as befitted a chief and leader, paddled out alone, facing peril for the \\nrest of the tribe. As Carlsen leaned over the rail to help the visitor up, he turned \\nhis head and remarked casually: \\n \\n\"They\\'ve dug up the money, Mr. Grief. The old beggar\\'s loaded with it.\" \\n \\nOne-Eye floundered down on deck, grinning appeasingly and failing to hide the \\nfear he had overcome but which still possessed him. He was lame of one leg, and \\nthis was accounted for by a terrible scar, inches deep, which ran down the thigh \\nfrom hip to knee. No clothes he wore whatever, not even a string, but his nose, \\nperforated in a dozen places and each perforation the setting for a carved spine of \\nbone, bristled like a porcupine. Around his neck and hanging down on his dirty \\nchest was a string of gold sovereigns. His ears were hung with silver half-crowns, \\nand from the cartilage separating his nostrils depended a big English penny, \\ntarnished and green, but unmistakable. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n35 \\n \\n\"Hold on, Grief,\" Pankburn said, with perfectly assumed carelessness. \"You say \\nthey know only beads and tobacco. Very well. You follow my lead. They\\'ve found \\nthe treasure, and we\\'ve got to trade them out of it. Get the whole crew aside and \\nlecture them that they are to be interested only in the pennies. Savve? Gold coins \\nmust be beneath contempt, and silver coins merely tolerated. Pennies are to be \\nthe only desirable things.\" \\n \\nPankburn took charge of the trading. For the penny in One-Eye\\'s nose he gave \\nten sticks of tobacco. Since each stick cost David Grief a cent, the bargain was \\nmanifestly unfair. But for the half-crowns Pankburn gave only one stick each. \\nThe string of sovereigns he refused to consider. The more he refused, the more \\nOne-Eye insisted on a trade. At last, with an appearance of irritation and anger, \\nand as a palpable concession, Pankburn gave two sticks for the string, which was \\ncomposed of ten sovereigns. \\n \\n\"I take my hat off to you,\" Grief said to Pankburn that night at dinner. \"The \\nsituation is patent. You\\'ve reversed the scale of value. They\\'ll figure the pennies \\nas priceless possessions and the sovereigns as beneath price. Result: they\\'ll hang \\non to the pennies and force us to trade for sovereigns. Pankburn, I drink your \\nhealth! Boy!--another cup of tea for Mr. Pankburn.\" \\n \\nVII \\n \\nFollowed a golden week. From dawn till dark a row of canoes rested on their \\npaddles two hundred feet away. This was the deadline. Rapa sailors, armed with \\nrifles, maintained it. But one canoe at a time was permitted alongside, and but \\none black at a time was permitted to come over the rail. Here, under the awning, \\nrelieving one another in hourly shifts, the four white men carried on the trade. \\nThe rate of exchange was that established by Pankburn with One-Eye. Five \\nsovereigns fetched a stick of tobacco; a hundred sovereigns, twenty sticks. Thus, \\na crafty-eyed cannibal would deposit on the table a thousand dollars in gold, and \\ngo back over the rail, hugely-satisfied, with forty cents\\' worth of tobacco in his \\nhand. \\n \\n\"Hope we\\'ve got enough tobacco to hold out,\" Carlsen muttered dubiously, as \\nanother case was sawed in half. \\n \\nAlbright laughed. \\n \\n\"We\\'ve got fifty cases below,\" he said, \"and as I figure it, three cases buy a \\nhundred thousand dollars. There was only a million dollars buried, so thirty \\ncases ought to get it. Though, of course, we\\'ve got to allow a margin for the silver \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n36 \\nand the pennies. That Ecuadoran bunch must have salted down all the coin in \\nsight.\" \\n \\nVery few pennies and shillings appeared, though Pankburn continually and \\nanxiously inquired for them. Pennies were the one thing he seemed to desire, and \\nhe made his eyes flash covetously whenever one was produced. True to his \\ntheory, the savages concluded that the gold, being of slight value, must be \\ndisposed of first. A penny, worth fifty times as much as a sovereign, was \\nsomething to retain and treasure. Doubtless, in their jungle-lairs, the wise old \\ngray-beards put their heads together and agreed to raise the price on pennies \\nwhen the worthless gold was all worked off. Who could tell? Mayhap the strange \\nwhite men could be made to give even twenty sticks for a priceless copper. \\n \\nBy the end of the week the trade went slack. There was only the slightest dribble \\nof gold. An occasional penny was reluctantly disposed of for ten sticks, while \\nseveral thousand dollars in silver came in. \\n \\nOn the morning of the eighth day no trading was done. The gray-beards had \\nmatured their plan and were demanding twenty sticks for a penny, One-Eye \\ndelivered the new rate of exchange. The white men appeared to take it with great \\nseriousness, for they stood together debating in low voices. Had One-Eye \\nunderstood English he would have been enlightened. \\n \\n\"We\\'ve got just a little over eight hundred thousand, not counting the silver,\" Grief \\nsaid. \"And that\\'s about all there is. The bush tribes behind have most probably \\ngot the other two hundred thousand. Return in three months, and the salt-water \\ncrowd will have traded back for it; also they will be out of tobacco by that time.\" \\n \\n\"It would be a sin to buy pennies,\" Albright grinned. \"It goes against the thrifty \\ngrain of my trader\\'s soul.\" \\n \\n\"There\\'s a whiff of land-breeze stirring,\" Grief said, looking at Pankburn. \"What do \\nyou say?\" \\n \\nPankburn nodded. \\n \\n\"Very well.\" Grief measured the faintness and irregularity of the wind against his \\ncheek. \\n \\n\"Mr. Carlsen, heave short, and get off the gaskets. And stand by with the \\nwhaleboats to tow. This breeze is not dependable.\" \\n \\nHe picked up a part case of tobacco, containing six or seven hundred sticks, put \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n37 \\nit in One-Eye\\'s hands, and helped that bewildered savage over the rail. As the \\nforesail went up the mast, a wail of consternation arose from the canoes lying \\nalong the dead-line. And as the anchor broke out and the Kittiwake\\'s head paid \\noff in the light breeze, old One-Eye, daring the rifles levelled on him, paddled \\nalongside and made frantic signs of his tribe\\'s willingness to trade pennies for ten \\nsticks. \\n \\n\"Boy!--a drinking nut,\" Pankburn called. \\n \\n\"It\\'s Sydney Heads for you,\" Grief said. \"And then what?\" \\n \\n\"I\\'m coming back with you for that two hundred thousand,\" Pankburn answered. \\n\"In the meantime I\\'m going to build an island schooner. Also, I\\'m going to call \\nthose guardians of mine before the court to show cause why my father\\'s money \\nshould not be turned over to me. Show cause? I\\'ll show them cause why it \\nshould.\" \\n \\nHe swelled his biceps proudly under the thin sleeve, reached for the two black \\nstewards, and put them above his head like a pair of dumbbells. \\n \\n\"Come on! Swing out on that fore-boom-tackle!\" Carlsen shouted from aft, where \\nthe mainsail was being winged out. \\n \\nPankburn dropped the stewards and raced for it, beating a Rapa sailor by two \\njumps to the hauling part. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n38 \\n \\nChapter Three--THE DEVILS OF FUATINO \\n \\n I \\n \\nOf his many schooners, ketches and cutters that nosed about among the coral \\nisles of the South Seas, David Grief loved most the Rattler--a yacht-like schooner \\nof ninety tons with so swift a pair of heels that she had made herself famous, in \\nthe old days, opium-smuggling from San Diego to Puget Sound, raiding the seal-\\nrookeries of Bering Sea, and running arms in the Far East. A stench and an \\nabomination to government officials, she had been the joy of all sailormen, and \\nthe pride of the shipwrights who built her. Even now, after forty years of driving, \\nshe was still the same old Rattler, fore-reaching in the same marvellous manner \\nthat compelled sailors to see in order to believe and that punctuated many an \\nangry discussion with words and blows on the beaches of all the ports from \\nValparaiso to Manila Bay. \\n \\nOn this night, close-hauled, her big mainsail preposterously flattened down, her \\nluffs pulsing emptily on the lift of each smooth swell, she was sliding an easy four \\nknots through the water on the veriest whisper of a breeze. For an hour David \\nGrief had been leaning on the rail at the lee fore-rigging, gazing overside at the \\nsteady phosphorescence of her gait. The faint back-draught from the headsails \\nfanned his cheek and chest with a wine of coolness, and he was in an ecstasy of \\nappreciation of the schooner\\'s qualities. \\n \\n\"Eh!--She\\'s a beauty, Taute, a beauty,\" he said to the Kanaka lookout, at the \\nsame time stroking the teak of the rail with an affectionate hand. \\n \\n\"Ay, skipper,\" the Kanaka answered in the rich, big-chested tones of Polynesia. \\n\"Thirty years I know ships, but never like \\'this. On Raiatea we call her Fanauao.\" \\n \\n\"The Dayborn,\" Grief translated the love-phrase. \"Who named her so?\" \\n \\nAbout to answer, Taute peered ahead with sudden intensity. Grief joined him in \\nthe gaze. \\n \\n\"Land,\" said Taute. \\n \\n\"Yes; Fuatino,\" Grief agreed, his eyes still fixed on the spot where the star-\\nluminous horizon was gouged by a blot of blackness. \"It\\'s all right. I\\'ll tell the \\ncaptain.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n39 \\nThe Rattler slid along until the loom of the island could be seen as well as sensed, \\nuntil the sleepy roar of breakers and the blatting of goats could be heard, until \\nthe wind, off the land, was flower-drenched with perfume. \\n \\n\"If it wasn\\'t a crevice, she could run the passage a night like this,\" Captain Glass \\nremarked regretfully, as he watched the wheel lashed hard down by the \\nsteersman. \\n \\nThe Rattler, run off shore a mile, had been hove to to wait until daylight ere she \\nattempted the perilous entrance to Fuatino. It was a perfect tropic night, with no \\nhint of rain or squall. For\\'ard, wherever their tasks left them, the Raiatea sailors \\nsank down to sleep on deck. Aft, the captain and mate and Grief spread their \\nbeds with similar languid unconcern. They lay on their blankets, smoking and \\nmurmuring sleepy conjectures about Mataara, the Queen of Fuatino, and about \\nthe love affair between her daughter, Naumoo, and Motuaro. \\n \\n\"They\\'re certainly a romantic lot,\" Brown, the mate, said. \"As romantic as we \\nwhites.\" \\n \\n\"As romantic as Pilsach,\" Grief laughed, \"and that is going some. How long ago \\nwas it, Captain, that he jumped you?\" \\n \\n\"Eleven years,\" Captain Glass grunted resentfully. \\n \\n\"Tell me about it,\" Brown pleaded. \"They say he\\'s never left Fuatino since. Is that \\nright?\" \\n \\n\"Right O,\" the captain rumbled. \"He\\'s in love with his wife--the little hussy! Stole \\nhim from me, and as good a sailorman as the trade has ever seen--if he is a \\nDutchman.\" \\n \\n\"German,\" Grief corrected. \\n \\n\"It\\'s all the same,\" was the retort. \"The sea was robbed of a good man that night \\nhe went ashore and Notutu took one look at him. I reckon they looked good to \\neach other. Before you could say skat, she\\'d put a wreath of some kind of white \\nflowers on his head, and in five minutes they were off down the beach, like a \\ncouple of kids, holding hands and laughing. I hope he\\'s blown that big coral \\npatch out of the channel. I always start a sheet or two of copper warping past.\" \\n \\n\"Go on with the story,\" Brown urged. \\n \\n\"That\\'s all. He was finished right there. Got married that night. Never came on \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n40 \\nboard again. I looked him up next day. Found him in a straw house in the bush, \\nbarelegged, a white savage, all mixed up with flowers and things and playing a \\nguitar. Looked like a bally ass. Told me to send his things ashore. I told him I\\'d \\nsee him damned first. And that\\'s all. You\\'ll see her to-morrow. They\\'ve got three \\nkiddies now--wonderful little rascals. I\\'ve a phonograph down below for him, and \\nabout a million records.\" \\n \\n\"And then you made him trader?\" the mate inquired of Grief. \\n \\n\"What else could I do? Fuatino is a love island, and Filsach is a lover. He knows \\nthe native, too--one of the best traders I\\'ve got, or ever had. He\\'s responsible. \\nYou\\'ll see him to-morrow.\" \\n \\n\"Look here, young man,\" Captain Glass rumbled threateningly at his mate. \"Are \\nyou romantic? Because if you are, on board you stay. Fuatino\\'s the island of \\nromantic insanity. Everybody\\'s in love with somebody. They live on love. It\\'s in \\nthe milk of the cocoa-nuts, or the air, or the sea. The history of the island for the \\nlast ten thousand years is nothing but love affairs. I know. I\\'ve talked with the old \\nmen. And if I catch you starting down the beach hand in hand--\" \\n \\nHis sudden cessation caused both the other men to look at him. They followed his \\ngaze, which passed across them to the main rigging, and saw what he saw, a \\nbrown hand and arm, muscular and wet, being joined from overside by a second \\nbrown hand and arm. A head followed, thatched with long elfin locks, and then a \\nface, with roguish black eyes, lined with the marks of wildwood\\'s laughter. \\n \\n\"My God!\" Brown breathed. \"It\\'s a faun--a sea-faun.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s the Goat Man,\" said Glass. \\n \\n\"It is Mauriri,\" said Grief. \"He is my own blood brother by sacred plight of native \\ncustom. His name is mine, and mine is his.\" \\n \\nBroad brown shoulders and a magnificent chest rose above the rail, and, with \\nwhat seemed effortless ease, the whole grand body followed over the rail and \\nnoiselessly trod the deck. Brown, who might have been other things than the \\nmate of an island schooner, was enchanted. All that he had ever gleaned from the \\nbooks proclaimed indubitably the faun-likeness of this visitant of the deep. \"But a \\nsad faun,\" was the young man\\'s judgment, as the golden-brown woods god strode \\nforward to where David Grief sat up with outstretched hand. \\n \\n\"David,\" said David Grief. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n41 \\n\"Mauriri, Big Brother,\" said Mauriri. \\n \\nAnd thereafter, in the custom of men who have pledged blood brotherhood, each \\ncalled the other, not by the other\\'s name, but by his own. Also, they talked in the \\nPolynesian tongue of Fuatino, and Brown could only sit and guess. \\n \\n\"A long swim to say talofa,\" Grief said, as the other sat and streamed water on the \\ndeck. \\n \\n\"Many days and nights have I watched for your coming, Big Brother,\" Mauriri \\nreplied. \"I have sat on the Big Rock, where the dynamite is kept, of which I have \\nbeen made keeper. I saw you come up to the entrance and run back into \\ndarkness. I knew you waited till morning, and I followed. Great trouble has come \\nupon us. Mataara has cried these many days for your coming. She is an old \\nwoman, and Motauri is dead, and she is sad.\" \\n \\n\"Did he marry Naumoo?\" Grief asked, after he had shaken his head and sighed by \\nthe custom. \\n \\n\"Yes. In the end they ran to live with the goats, till Mataara forgave, when they \\nreturned to live with her in the Big House. But he is now dead, and Naumoo soon \\nwill die. Great is our trouble, Big Brother. Tori is dead, and Tati-Tori, and Petoo, \\nand Nari, and Pilsach, and others.\" \\n \\n\"Pilsach, too!\" Grief exclaimed. \"Has there been a sickness?\" \\n \\n\"There has been much killing. Listen, Big Brother, Three weeks ago a strange \\nschooner came. From the Big Rock I saw her topsails above the sea. She towed in \\nwith her boats, but they did not warp by the big patch, and she pounded many \\ntimes. She is now on the beach, where they are strengthening the broken timbers. \\nThere are eight white men on board. They have women from some island far to \\nthe east. The women talk a language in many ways like ours, only different. But \\nwe can understand. They say they were stolen by the men on the schooner. We \\ndo not know, but they sing and dance and are happy.\" \\n \\n\"And the men?\" Grief interrupted. \\n \\n\"They talk French. I know, for there was a mate on your schooner who talked \\nFrench long ago. There are two chief men, and they do not look like the others. \\nThey have blue eyes like you, and they are devils. One is a bigger devil than the \\nother. The other six are also devils. They do not pay us for our yams, and taro, \\nand breadfruit. They take everything from us, and if we complain they kill us. \\nThus was killed Tori, and Tati-Tori, and Petoo, and others. We cannot fight, for \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n42 \\nwe have no guns--only two or three old guns. \\n \\n\"They ill-treat our women. Thus was killed Motuaro, who made defence of \\nNaumoo, whom they have now taken on board their schooner. It was because of \\nthis that Pilsach was killed. Him the chief of the two chief men, the Big Devil, \\nshot once in his whaleboat, and twice when he tried to crawl up the sand of the \\nbeach. Pilsach was a brave man, and Notutu now sits in the house and cries \\nwithout end. Many of the people are afraid, and have run to live with the goats. \\nBut there is not food for all in the high mountains. And the men will not go out \\nand fish, and they work no more in the gardens because of the devils who take all \\nthey have. And we are ready to fight. \\n \\n\"Big Brother, we need guns, and much ammunition. I sent word before I swam \\nout to you, and the men are waiting. The strange white men do not know you are \\ncome. Give me a boat, and the guns, and I will go back before the sun. And when \\nyou come to-morrow we will be ready for the word from you to kill the strange \\nwhite men. They must be killed. Big Brother, you have ever been of the blood with \\nus, and the men and women have prayed to many gods for your coming. And you \\nare come.\" \\n \\n\"I will go in the boat with you,\" Grief said. \\n \\n\"No, Big Brother,\" was Mauriri\\'s reply. \"You must be with the schooner. The \\nstrange white men will fear the schooner, not us. We will have the guns, and they \\nwill not know. It is only when they see your schooner come that they will be \\nalarmed. Send the young man there with the boat.\" \\n \\nSo it was that Brown, thrilling with all the romance and adventure he had read \\nand guessed and never lived, took his place in the sternsheets of a whaleboat, \\nloaded with rifles and cartridges, rowed by four Baiatea sailors, steered by a \\ngolden-brown, sea-swimming faun, and directed through the warm tropic \\ndarkness toward the half-mythical love island of Fuatino, which had been \\ninvaded by twentieth century pirates. \\n \\nII \\n \\nIf a line be drawn between Jaluit, in the Marshall Group, and Bougainville, in the \\nSolomons, and if this line be bisected at two degrees south of the equator by a \\nline drawn from Ukuor, in the Carolines, the high island of Fuatino will be raised \\nin that sun-washed stretch of lonely sea. Inhabited by a stock kindred to the \\nHawaiian, the Samoan, the Tahitian, and the Maori, Fuatino becomes the apex of \\nthe wedge driven by Polynesia far to the west and in between Melanesia and \\nMicronesia. And it was Fuatino that David Grief raised next morning, two miles to \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n43 \\nthe east and in direct line with the rising sun. The same whisper of a breeze held, \\nand the Rattler slid through the smooth sea at a rate that would have been \\neminently proper for an island schooner had the breeze been thrice as strong. \\n \\nFuatino was nothing else than an ancient crater, thrust upward from the sea-\\nbottom by some primordial cataclysm. The western portion, broken and crumbled \\nto sea level, was the entrance to the crater itself, which constituted the harbour. \\nThus, Fuatino was like a rugged horseshoe, the heel pointing to the west. And \\ninto the opening at the heel the Rattler steered. Captain Glass, binoculars in \\nhand and peering at the chart made by himself, which was spread on top the \\ncabin, straightened up with an expression on his face that was half alarm, half \\nresignation. \\n \\n\"It\\'s coming,\" he said. \"Fever. It wasn\\'t due till to-morrow. It always hits me hard, \\nMr. Grief. In five minutes I\\'ll be off my head. You\\'ll have to con the schooner in. \\nBoy! Get my bunk ready! Plenty of blankets! Fill that hot-water bottle! It\\'s so \\ncalm, Mr. Grief, that I think you can pass the big patch without warping. Take \\nthe leading wind and shoot her. She\\'s the only craft in the South Pacific that can \\ndo it, and I know you know the trick. You can scrape the Big Rock by just \\nwatching out for the main boom.\" \\n \\nHe had talked rapidly, almost like a drunken man, as his reeling brain battled \\nwith the rising shock of the malarial stroke. When he stumbled toward the \\ncompanionway, his face was purpling and mottling as if attacked by some \\nmonstrous inflammation or decay. His eyes were setting in a glassy bulge, his \\nhands shaking, his teeth clicking in the spasms of chill. \\n \\n\"Two hours to get the sweat,\" he chattered with a ghastly grin. \"And a couple \\nmore and I\\'ll be all right. I know the damned thing to the last minute it runs its \\ncourse. Y-y-you t-t-take ch-ch-ch-ch----\" \\n \\nHis voice faded away in a weak stutter as he collapsed down into the cabin and \\nhis employer took charge. The Rattler was just entering the passage. The heels of \\nthe horseshoe island were two huge mountains of rock a thousand feet high, each \\nalmost broken off from the mainland and connected with it by a low and narrow \\npeninsula. Between the heels was a half-mile stretch, all but blocked by a reef of \\ncoral extending across from the south heel. The passage, which Captain Glass \\nhad called a crevice, twisted into this reef, curved directly to the north heel, and \\nran along the base of the perpendicular rock. At this point, with the main-boom \\nalmost grazing the rock on the port side, Grief, peering down on the starboard \\nside, could see bottom less than two fathoms beneath and shoaling steeply. With \\na whaleboat towing for steerage and as a precaution against back-draughts from \\nthe cliff, and taking advantage of a fan of breeze, he shook the Rattler full into it \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n44 \\nand glided by the big coral patch without warping. As it was, he just scraped, but \\nso softly as not to start the copper. \\n \\nThe harbour of Fuatino opened before him. It was a circular sheet of water, five \\nmiles in diameter, rimmed with white coral beaches, from which the verdure-clad \\nslopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls. The crests of the walls were saw-\\ntoothed, volcanic peaks, capped and halo\\'d with captive trade-wind clouds. Every \\nnook and crevice of the disintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping, climbing \\nvines and trees--a green foam of vegetation. Thin streams of water, that were \\nmere films of mist, swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents of \\nhundreds of feet. And to complete the magic of the place, the warm, moist air was \\nheavy with the perfume of the yellow-blossomed cassi. \\n \\nFanning along against light, vagrant airs, the Rattler worked in. Calling the \\nwhale-boat on board, Grief searched out the shore with his binoculars. There was \\nno life. In the hot blaze of tropic sun the place slept. There was no sign of \\nwelcome. Up the beach, on the north shore, where the fringe of cocoanut palms \\nconcealed the village, he could see the black bows of the canoes in the canoe-\\nhouses. On the beach, on even keel, rested the strange schooner. Nothing moved \\non board of her or around her. Not until the beach lay fifty yards away did Grief \\nlet go the anchor in forty fathoms. Out in the middle, long years before, he had \\nsounded three hundred fathoms without reaching bottom, which was to be \\nexpected of a healthy crater-pit like Fuatino. As the chain roared and surged \\nthrough the hawse-pipe he noticed a number of native women, lusciously large as \\nonly those of Polynesia are, in flowing ahu\\'s, flower-crowned, stream out on the \\ndeck of the schooner on the beach. Also, and what they did not see, he saw from \\nthe galley the squat figure of a man steal for\\'ard, drop to the sand, and dive into \\nthe green screen of bush. \\n \\nWhile the sails were furled and gasketed, awnings stretched, and sheets and \\ntackles coiled harbour fashion, David Grief paced the deck and looked vainly for a \\nflutter of life elsewhere than on the strange schooner. Once, beyond any doubt, \\nhe heard the distant crack of a rifle in the direction of the Big Rock. There were \\nno further shots, and he thought of it as some hunter shooting a wild goat. \\n \\nAt the end of another hour Captain Glass, under a mountain of blankets, had \\nceased shivering and was in the inferno of a profound sweat. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll be all right in half an hour,\" he said weakly. \\n \\n\"Very well,\" Grief answered. \"The place is dead, and I\\'m going ashore to see \\nMataara and find out the situation.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n45 \\n\"It\\'s a tough bunch; keep your eyes open,\" the captain warned him. \"If you\\'re not \\nback in an hour, send word off.\" \\n \\nGrief took the steering-sweep, and four of his Raiatea men bent to the oars. As \\nthey landed on the beach he looked curiously at the women under the schooner\\'s \\nawning. He waved his hand tentatively, and they, after giggling, waved back. \\n \\n\"Talofa!\" he called. \\n \\nThey understood the greeting, but replied, \"Iorana,\" and he knew they came from \\nthe Society Group. \\n \\n\"Huahine,\" one of his sailors unhesitatingly named their island. Grief asked them \\nwhence they came, and with giggles and laughter they replied, \"Huahine.\" \\n \\n\"It looks like old Dupuy\\'s schooner,\" Grief said, in Tahitian, speaking in a low \\nvoice. \"Don\\'t look too hard. What do you think, eh? Isn\\'t it the Valetta?\" \\n \\nAs the men climbed out and lifted the whale-boat slightly up the beach they stole \\ncareless glances at the vessel. \\n \\n\"It is the Valetta,\" Taute said. \"She carried her topmast away seven years ago. At \\nPapeete they rigged a new one. It was ten feet shorter. That is the one.\" \\n \\n\"Go over and talk with the women, you boys. You can almost see Huahine from \\nRaiatea, and you\\'ll be sure to know some of them. Find out all you can. And if \\nany of the white men show up, don\\'t start a row.\" \\n \\nAn army of hermit crabs scuttled and rustled away before him as he advanced up \\nthe beach, but under the palms no pigs rooted and grunted. The cocoanuts lay \\nwhere they had fallen, and at the copra-sheds there were no signs of curing. \\nIndustry and tidiness had vanished. Grass house after grass house he found \\ndeserted. Once he came upon an old man, blind, toothless, prodigiously wrinkled, \\nwho sat in the shade and babbled with fear when he spoke to him. It was as if the \\nplace had been struck with the plague, was Grief\\'s thought, as he finally \\napproached the Big House. All was desolation and disarray. There were no flower-\\ncrowned men and maidens, no brown babies rolling in the shade of the avocado \\ntrees. In the doorway, crouched and rocking back and forth, sat Mataara, the old \\nqueen. She wept afresh at sight of him, divided between the tale of her woe and \\nregret that no follower was left to dispense to him her hospitality. \\n \\n\"And so they have taken Naumoo,\" she finished. \"Motauri is dead. My people have \\nfled and are starving with the goats. And there is no one to open for you even a \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n46 \\ndrinking cocoa-nut. O Brother, your white brothers be devils.\" \\n \\n\"They are no brothers of mine, Mataara,\" Grief consoled. \"They are robbers and \\npigs, and I shall clean the island of them----\" \\n \\nHe broke off to whirl half around, his hand flashing to his waist and back again, \\nthe big Colt\\'s levelled at the figure of a man, bent double, that rushed at him from \\nout of the trees. He did not pull the trigger, nor did the man pause till he had \\nflung himself headlong at Grief\\'s feet and begun to pour forth a stream of \\nuncouth and awful noises. He recognized the creature as the one he had seen \\nsteal from the Valetta and dive into the bush; but not until he raised him up and \\nwatched the contortions of the hare-lipped mouth could he understand what he \\nuttered. \\n \\n\"Save me, master, save me!\" the man yammered, in English, though he was \\nunmistakably a South Sea native. \"I know you! Save me!\" \\n \\nAnd thereat he broke into a wild outpour of incoherence that did not cease until \\nGrief seized him by the shoulders and shook him into silence. \\n \\n\"I know you,\" Grief said. \"You were cook in the French Hotel at Papeete two years \\nago. Everybody called you \\'Hare-Lip.\\'\" \\n \\nThe man nodded violently. \\n \\n\"I am now cook of the Valetta,\" he spat and spluttered, his mouth writhing in a \\nfearful struggle with its defect. \"I know you. I saw you at the hotel. I saw you at \\nLavina\\'s. I saw you on the Kittiwake. I saw you at the Mariposa wharf. You are \\nCaptain Grief, and you will save me. Those men are devils. They killed Captain \\nDupuy. Me they made kill half the crew. Two they shot from the cross-trees. The \\nrest they shot in the water. I knew them all. They stole the girls from Huahine. \\nThey added to their strength with jail-men from Noumea. They robbed the traders \\nin the New Hebrides. They killed the trader at Vanikori, and stole two women \\nthere. They----\" \\n \\nBut Grief no longer heard. Through the trees, from the direction of the harbour, \\ncame a rattle of rifles, and he started on the run for the beach. Pirates from Tahiti \\nand convicts from New Caledonia! A pretty bunch of desperadoes that even now \\nwas attacking his schooner. Hare-Lip followed, still spluttering and spitting his \\ntale of the white devils\\' doings. \\n \\nThe rifle-firing ceased as abruptly as it had begun, but Grief ran on, perplexed by \\nominous conjectures, until, in a turn of the path, he encountered Mauriri \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n47 \\nrunning toward him from the beach. \\n \\n\"Big Brother,\" the Goat Man panted, \"I was too late. They have taken your \\nschooner. Come! For now they will seek for you.\" \\n \\nHe started back up the path away from the beach. \\n \\n\"Where is Brown?\" Grief demanded. \\n \\n\"On the Big Rock. I will tell you afterward. Come now!\" \\n \\n\"But my men in the whaleboat?\" \\n \\nMauriri was in an agony of apprehension. \\n \\n\"They are with the women on the strange schooner. They will not be killed. I tell \\nyou true. The devils want sailors. But you they will kill. Listen!\" From the water, \\nin a cracked tenor voice, came a French hunting song. \"They are landing on the \\nbeach. They have taken your schooner--that I saw. Come!\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nCareless of his own life and skin, nevertheless David Grief was possessed of no \\nfalse hardihood. He knew when to fight and when to run, and that this was the \\ntime for running he had no doubt. Up the path, past the old men sitting in the \\nshade, past Mataara crouched in the doorway of the Big House, he followed at the \\nheels of Mauriri. At his own heels, doglike, plodded Hare-Lip. From behind came \\nthe cries of the hunters, but the pace Mauriri led them was heartbreaking. The \\nbroad path narrowed, swung to the right, and pitched upward. The last grass \\nhouse was left, and through high thickets of cassi and swarms of great golden \\nwasps the way rose steeply until it became a goat-track. Pointing upward to a \\nbare shoulder of volcanic rock, Mauriri indicated the trail across its face. \\n \\n\"Past that we are safe, Big Brother,\" he said. \"The white devils never dare it, for \\nthere are rocks we roll down on their heads, and there is no other path. Always \\ndo they stop here and shoot when we cross the rock. Come!\" \\n \\nA quarter of an hour later they paused where the trail went naked on the face of \\nthe rock. \\n \\n\"Wait, and when you come, come quickly,\" Mauriri cautioned. \\n \\nHe sprang into the blaze of sunlight, and from below several rifles pumped \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n48 \\nrapidly. Bullets smacked about him, and puffs of stone-dust flew out, but he won \\nsafely across. Grief followed, and so near did one bullet come that the dust of its \\nimpact stung his cheek. Nor was Hare-Lip struck, though he essayed the passage \\nmore slowly. \\n \\nFor the rest of the day, on the greater heights, they lay in a lava glen where \\nterraced taro and papaia grew. And here Grief made his plans and learned the \\nfulness of the situation. \\n \\n\"It was ill luck,\" Mauriri said. \"Of all nights this one night was selected by the \\nwhite devils to go fishing. It was dark as we came through the passage. They were \\nin boats and canoes. Always do they have their rifles with them. One Raiatea man \\nthey shot. Brown was very brave. We tried to get by to the top of the bay, but they \\nheaded us off, and we were driven in between the Big Rock and the village. We \\nsaved the guns and all the ammunition, but they got the boat. Thus they learned \\nof your coming. Brown is now on this side of the Big Rock with the guns and the \\nammunition.\" \\n \\n\"But why didn\\'t he go over the top of the Big Rock and give me warning as I came \\nin from the sea?\" Grief criticised. \\n \\n\"They knew not the way. Only the goats and I know the way. And this I forgot, for \\nI crept through the bush to gain the water and swim to you. But the devils were \\nin the bush shooting at Brown and the Raiatea men; and me they hunted till \\ndaylight, and through the morning they hunted me there in the low-lying land. \\nThen you came in your schooner, and they watched till you went ashore, and I \\ngot away through the bush, but you were already ashore.\" \\n \\n\"You fired that shot?\" \\n \\n\"Yes; to warn you. But they were wise and would not shoot back, and it was my \\nlast cartridge.\" \\n \\n\"Now you, Hare-Lip?\" Grief said to the Valetta\\'s cook. \\n \\nHis tale was long and painfully detailed. For a year he had been sailing out of \\nTahiti and through the Paumotus on the Valetta. Old Dupuy was owner and \\ncaptain. On his last cruise he had shipped two strangers in Tahiti as mate and \\nsupercargo. Also, another stranger he carried to be his agent on Fanriki. Raoul \\nVan Asveld and Carl Lepsius were the names of the mate and supercargo. \\n \\n\"They are brothers, I know, for I have heard them talk in the dark, on deck, when \\nthey thought no one listened,\" Hare-Lip explained. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n49 \\n \\nThe Valetta cruised through the Low Islands, picking up shell and pearls at \\nDupuy\\'s stations. Frans Amundson, the third stranger, relieved Pierre Gollard at \\nFanriki. Pierre Gollard came on board to go back to Tahiti. The natives of Fanriki \\nsaid he had a quart of pearls to turn over to Dupuy. The first night out from \\nFanriki there was shooting in the cabin. Then the bodies of Dupuy and Pierre \\nGollard were thrown overboard. The Tahitian sailors fled to the forecastle. For two \\ndays, with nothing to eat and the Valetta hove to, they remained below. Then \\nRaoul Van Asveld put poison in the meal he made Hare-Lip cook and carry \\nfor\\'ard. Half the sailors died. \\n \\n\"He had a rifle pointed at me, master; what could I do?\" Hare-Lip whimpered. \"Of \\nthe rest, two went up the rigging and were shot. Fanriki was ten miles away. The \\nothers went overboard to swim. They were shot as they swam. I, only, lived, and \\nthe two devils; for me they wanted to cook for them. That day, with the breeze, \\nthey went back to Fanrika and took on Frans Amundson, for he was one of \\nthem.\" \\n \\nThen followed Hare-Lip\\'s nightmare experiences as the schooner wandered on the \\nlong reaches to the westward. He was the one living witness and knew they would \\nhave killed him had he not been the cook. At Noumea five convicts had joined \\nthem. Hare-Lip was never permitted ashore at any of the islands, and Grief was \\nthe first outsider to whom he had spoken. \\n \\n\"And now they will kill me,\" Hare-Lip spluttered, \"for they will know I have told \\nyou. Yet am I not all a coward, and I will stay with you, master, and die with you.\" \\n \\nThe Goat Man shook his head and stood up. \\n \\n\"Lie here and rest,\" he said to Grief. \"It will be a long swim to-night. As for this \\ncook-man, I will take him now to the higher places where my brothers live with \\nthe goats.\" \\n \\nIV \\n \\n\"It is well that you swim as a man should, Big Brother,\" Mauriri whispered. \\n \\nFrom the lava glen they had descended to the head of the bay and taken to the \\nwater. They swam softly, without splash, Mauriri in the lead. The black walls of \\nthe crater rose about them till it seemed they swam on the bottom of a great bowl. \\nAbove was the sky of faintly luminous star-dust. Ahead they could see the light \\nwhich marked the Rattler, and from her deck, softened by distance, came a \\ngospel hymn played on the phonograph intended for Pilsach. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n50 \\n \\nThe two swimmers bore to the left, away from the captured schooner. Laughter \\nand song followed on board after the hymn, then the phonograph started again. \\nGrief grinned to himself at the appositeness of it as \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" floated \\nout over the dark water. \\n \\n\"We must take the passage and land on the Big Rock,\" Mauriri whispered. \"The \\ndevils are holding the low land. Listen!\" \\n \\nHalf a dozen rifle shots, at irregular intervals, attested that Brown still held the \\nRock and that the pirates had invested the narrow peninsula. \\n \\nAt the end of another hour they swam under the frowning loom of the Big Rock. \\nMauriri, feeling his way, led the landing in a crevice, up which for a hundred feet \\nthey climbed to a narrow ledge. \\n \\n\"Stay here,\" said Mauriri. \"I go to Brown. In the morning I shall return.\" \\n \\n\"I will go with you, Brother,\" Grief said. \\n \\nMauriri laughed in the darkness. \\n \\n\"Even you, Big Brother, cannot do this thing. I am the Goat Man, and I only, of all \\nFuatino, can go over the Big Rock in the night. Furthermore, it will be the first \\ntime that even I have done it. Put out your hand. You feel it? That is where \\nPilsach\\'s dynamite is kept. Lie close beside the wall and you may sleep without \\nfalling. I go now.\" \\n \\nAnd high above the sounding surf, on a narrow shelf beside a ton of dynamite, \\nDavid Grief planned his campaign, then rested his cheek on his arm and slept. \\n \\nIn the morning, when Mauriri led him over the summit of the Big Rock, David \\nGrief understood why he could not have done it in the night. Despite the \\naccustomed nerve of a sailor for height and precarious clinging, he marvelled that \\nhe was able to do it in the broad light of day. There were places, always under \\nminute direction of Mauriri, that he leaned forward, falling, across hundred-foot-\\ndeep crevices, until his outstretched hands struck a grip on the opposing wall \\nand his legs could then be drawn across after. Once, there was a ten-foot leap, \\nabove half a thousand feet of yawning emptiness and down a fathom\\'s length to a \\nmeagre foothold. And he, despite his cool head, lost it another time on a shelf, a \\nscant twelve inches wide, where all hand-holds seemed to fail him. And Mauriri, \\nseeing him sway, swung his own body far out and over the gulf and passed him, \\nat the same time striking him sharply on the back to brace his reeling brain. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n51 \\nThen it was, and forever after, that he fully knew why Mauriri had been named \\nthe Goat Man. \\n \\nV \\n \\nThe defence of the Big Rock had its good points and its defects. Impregnable to \\nassault, two men could hold it against ten thousand. Also, it guarded the passage \\nto open sea. The two schooners, Raoul Van Asveld, and his cutthroat following \\nwere bottled up. Grief, with the ton of dynamite, which he had removed higher up \\nthe rock, was master. This he demonstrated, one morning, when the schooners \\nattempted to put to sea. The Valetta led, the whaleboat towing her manned by \\ncaptured Fuatino men. Grief and the Goat Man peered straight down from a safe \\nrock-shelter, three hundred feet above. Their rifles were beside them, also a \\nglowing fire-stick and a big bundle of dynamite sticks with fuses and decanators \\nattached. As the whaleboat came beneath, Mauriri shook his head. \\n \\n\"They are our brothers. We cannot shoot.\" \\n \\nFor\\'ard, on the Valetta, were several of Grief\\'s own Raiatea sailors. Aft stood \\nanother at the wheel. The pirates were below, or on the other schooner, with the \\nexception of one who stood, rifle in hand, amidships. For protection he held \\nNaumoo, the Queen\\'s daughter, close to him. \\n \\n\"That is the chief devil,\" Mauriri whispered, \"and his eyes are blue like yours. He \\nis a terrible man. See! He holds Naumoo that we may not shoot him.\" \\n \\nA light air and a slight tide were making into the passage, and the schooner\\'s \\nprogress was slow. \\n \\n\"Do you speak English?\" Grief called down. \\n \\nThe man startled, half lifted his rifle to the perpendicular, and looked up. There \\nwas something quick and catlike in his movements, and in his burned blond face \\na fighting eagerness. It was the face of a killer. \\n \\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"What do you want?\" \\n \\n\"Turn back, or I\\'ll blow your schooner up,\" Grief warned. He blew on the fire-stick \\nand whispered, \"Tell Naumoo to break away from him and run aft.\" \\n \\nFrom the Rattler, close astern, rifles cracked, and bullets spatted against the \\nrock. Van Asveld laughed defiantly, and Mauriri called down in the native tongue \\nto the woman. When directly beneath, Grief, watching, saw her jerk away from \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n52 \\nthe man. On the instant Grief touched the fire-stick to the match-head in the \\nsplit end of the short fuse, sprang into view on the face of the rock, and dropped \\nthe dynamite. Van Asveld had managed to catch the girl and was struggling with \\nher. The Goat Man held a rifle on him and waited a chance. The dynamite struck \\nthe deck in a compact package, bounded, and rolled into the port scupper. Van \\nAsveld saw it and hesitated, then he and the girl ran aft for their lives. The Goat \\nMan fired, but splintered the corner of the galley. The spattering of bullets from \\nthe Rattler increased, and the two on the rock crouched low for shelter and \\nwaited. Mauriri tried to see what was happening below, but Grief held him back. \\n \\n\"The fuse was too long,\" he said. \"I\\'ll know better next time.\" \\n \\nIt was half a minute before the explosion came. What happened afterward, for \\nsome little time, they could not tell, for the Rattler\\'s marksmen had got the range \\nand were maintaining a steady fire. Once, fanned by a couple of bullets, Grief \\nrisked a peep. The Valetta, her port deck and rail torn away, was listing and \\nsinking as she drifted back into the harbour. Climbing on board the Rattler were \\nthe men and the Huahine women who had been hidden in the Valetta\\'s cabin and \\nwho had swum for it under the protecting fire. The Fuatino men who had been \\ntowing in the whaleboat had cast off the line, dashed back through the passage, \\nand were rowing wildly for the south shore. \\n \\nFrom the shore of the peninsula the discharges of four rifles announced that \\nBrown and his men had worked through the jungle to the beach and were taking \\na hand. The bullets ceased coming, and Grief and Mauriri joined in with their \\nrifles. But they could do no damage, for the men of the Rattler were firing from \\nthe shelter of the deck-houses, while the wind and tide carried the schooner \\nfarther in. \\n \\nThere was no sign of the Valetta, which had sunk in the deep water of the crater. \\n \\nTwo things Raoul Van Asveld did that showed his keenness and coolness and \\nthat elicited Grief\\'s admiration. Under the Rattler\\'s rifle fire Raoul compelled the \\nfleeing Fuatino men to come in and surrender. And at the same time, dispatching \\nhalf his cutthroats in the Rattler\\'s boat, he threw them ashore and across the \\npeninsula, preventing Brown from getting away to the main part of the island. \\nAnd for the rest of the morning the intermittent shooting told to Grief how Brown \\nwas being driven in to the other side of the Big Rock. The situation was \\nunchanged, with the exception of the loss of the Valetta. \\n \\nVI \\n \\nThe defects of the position on the Big Rock were vital. There was neither food nor \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n53 \\nwater. For several nights, accompanied by one of the \\n \\nRaiatea men, Mauriri swam to the head of the bay for supplies. Then came the \\nnight when lights flared on the water and shots were fired. After that the water-\\nside of the Big Rock was invested as well. \\n \\n\"It\\'s a funny situation,\" Brown remarked, who was getting all the adventure he \\nhad been led to believe resided in the South Seas. \"We\\'ve got hold and can\\'t let go, \\nand Raoul has hold and can\\'t let go. He can\\'t get away, and we\\'re liable to starve \\nto death holding him.\" \\n \\n\"If the rain came, the rock-basins would fill,\" said Mauriri. It was their first \\ntwenty-four hours without water. \"Big Brother, to-night you and I will get water. \\nIt is the work of strong men.\" \\n \\nThat night, with cocoanut calabashes, each of quart capacity and tightly \\nstoppered, he led Grief down to the water from the peninsula side of the Big Rock. \\nThey swam out not more than a hundred feet. Beyond, they could hear the \\noccasional click of an oar or the knock of a paddle against a canoe, and \\nsometimes they saw the flare of matches as the men in the guarding boats lighted \\ncigarettes or pipes. \\n \\n\"Wait here,\" whispered Mauriri, \"and hold the calabashes.\" \\n \\nTurning over, he swam down. Grief, face downward, watched his phosphorescent \\ntrack glimmer, and dim, and vanish. A long minute afterward Mauriri broke \\nsurface noiselessly at Grief\\'s side. \\n \\n\"Here! Drink!\" \\n \\nThe calabash was full, and Grief drank sweet fresh water which had come up \\nfrom the depths of the salt. \\n \\n\"It flows out from the land,\" said Mauriri. \\n \\n\"On the bottom?\" \\n \\n\"No. The bottom is as far below as the mountains are above. Fifty feet down it \\nflows. Swim down until you feel its coolness.\" \\n \\nSeveral times filling and emptying his lungs in diver fashion, Grief turned over \\nand went down through the water. Salt it was to his lips, and warm to his flesh; \\nbut at last, deep down, it perceptibly chilled and tasted brackish. Then, suddenly, \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n54 \\nhis body entered the cold, subterranean stream. He removed the small stopper \\nfrom the calabash, and, as the sweet water gurgled into it, he saw the \\nphosphorescent glimmer of a big fish, like a sea ghost, drift sluggishly by. \\n \\nThereafter, holding the growing weight of the calabashes, he remained on the \\nsurface, while Mauriri took them down, one by one, and filled them. \\n \\n\"There are sharks,\" Grief said, as they swam back to shore. \\n \\n\"Pooh!\" was the answer. \"They are fish sharks. We of Fuatino are brothers to the \\nfish sharks.\" \\n \\n\"But the tiger sharks? I have seen them here.\" \\n \\n\"When they come, Big Brother, we will have no more water to drink--unless it \\nrains.\" \\n \\nVII \\n \\nA week later Mauriri and a Raiatea man swam back with empty calabashes. The \\ntiger sharks had arrived in the harbour. The next day they thirsted on the Big \\nRock. \\n \\n\"We must take our chance,\" said Grief. \"Tonight I shall go after water with \\nMautau. Tomorrow night, Brother, you will go with Tehaa.\" \\n \\nThree quarts only did Grief get, when the tiger sharks appeared and drove them \\nin. There were six of them on the Rock, and a pint a day, in the sweltering heat of \\nthe mid-tropics, is not sufficient moisture for a man\\'s body. The next night \\nMauriri and Tehaa returned with no water. And the day following Brown learned \\nthe full connotation of thirst, when the lips crack to bleeding, the mouth is coated \\nwith granular slime, and the swollen tongue finds the mouth too small for \\nresidence. \\n \\nGrief swam out in the darkness with Mautau. Turn by turn, they went down \\nthrough the salt, to the cool sweet stream, drinking their fill while the calabashes \\nwere filling. It was Mau-tau\\'s turn to descend with the last calabash, and Grief, \\npeering down from the surface, saw the glimmer of sea-ghosts and all the \\nphosphorescent display of the struggle. He swam back alone, but without \\nrelinquishing the precious burden of full calabashes. \\n \\nOf food they had little. Nothing grew on the Rock, and its sides, covered with \\nshellfish at sea level where the surf thundered in, were too precipitous for access. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n55 \\nHere and there, where crevices permitted, a few rank shellfish and sea urchins \\nwere gleaned. Sometimes frigate birds and other sea birds were snared. Once, \\nwith a piece of frigate bird, they succeeded in hooking a shark. After that, with \\njealously guarded shark-meat for bait, they managed on occasion to catch more \\nsharks. \\n \\nBut water remained their direst need. Mauriri prayed to the Goat God for rain. \\nTaute prayed to the Missionary God, and his two fellow islanders, backsliding, \\ninvoked the deities of their old heathen days. Grief grinned and considered. But \\nBrown, wild-eyed, with protruding blackened tongue, cursed. Especially he \\ncursed the phonograph that in the cool twilights ground out gospel hymns from \\nthe deck of the Rattler. One hymn in particular, \"Beyond the Smiling and the \\nWeeping,\" drove him to madness. It seemed a favourite on board the schooner, for \\nit was played most of all. Brown, hungry and thirsty, half out of his head from \\nweakness and suffering, could lie among the rocks with equanimity and listen to \\nthe tinkling of ukuleles and guitars, and the hulas and himines of the Huahine \\nwomen. But when the voices of the Trinity Choir floated over the water he was \\nbeside himself. One evening the cracked tenor took up the song with the \\nmachine: \\n \\n     \"Beyond the smiling and the weeping,         I shall be soon.      Beyond the \\nwaking and the sleeping,      Beyond the sowing and the reaping,         I shall be \\nsoon,         I shall be soon.\" \\n \\nThen it was that Brown rose up. Again and again, blindly, he emptied his rifle at \\nthe schooner. Laughter floated up from the men and women, and from the \\npeninsula came a splattering of return bullets; but the cracked tenor sang on, \\nand Brown continued to fire, until the hymn was played out. \\n \\nIt was that night that Grief and Mauriri came back with but one calabash of \\nwater. A patch of skin six inches long was missing from Grief\\'s shoulder in token \\nof the scrape of the sandpaper hide of a shark whose dash he had eluded. \\n \\nVIII \\n \\nIn the early morning of another day, before the sun-blaze had gained its full \\nstrength, came an offer of a parley from Raoul Van Asveld. \\n \\nBrown brought the word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred yards \\naway. Grief was squatted over a small fire, broiling a strip of shark-flesh. The last \\ntwenty-four hours had been lucky. Seaweed and sea urchins had been gathered. \\nTehaa had caught a shark, and Mauriri had captured a fair-sized octopus at the \\nbase of the crevice where the dynamite was stored. Then, too, in the darkness \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n56 \\nthey had made two successful swims for water before the tiger sharks had nosed \\nthem out. \\n \\n\"Said he\\'d like to come in and talk with you,\" Brown said. \"But I know what the \\nbrute is after. Wants to see how near starved to death we are.\" \\n \\n\"Bring him in,\" Grief said. \\n \\n\"And then we will kill him,\" the Goat Man cried joyously. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"But he is a killer of men, Big Brother, a beast and a devil,\" the Goat Man \\nprotested. \\n \\n\"He must not be killed, Brother. It is our way not to break our word.\" \\n \\n\"It is a foolish way.\" \\n \\n\"Still it is our way,\" Grief answered gravely, turning the strip of shark-meat over \\non the coals and noting the hungry sniff and look of Tehaa. \"Don\\'t do that, Tehaa, \\nwhen the Big Devil comes. Look as if you and hunger were strangers. Here, cook \\nthose sea urchins, you, and you, Big Brother, cook the squid. We will have the \\nBig Devil to feast with us. Spare nothing. Cook all.\" \\n \\nAnd, still broiling meat, Grief arose as Raoul Van Asveld, followed by a large Irish \\nterrier, strode into camp. Raoul did not make the mistake of holding out his \\nhand. \\n \\n\"Hello!\" he said. \"I\\'ve heard of you.\" \\n \\n\"I wish I\\'d never heard of you,\" Grief answered. \\n \\n\"Same here,\" was the response. \"At first, before I knew who it was, I thought I had \\nto deal with an ordinary trading captain. That\\'s why you\\'ve got me bottled up.\" \\n \\n\"And I am ashamed to say that I underrated you,\" Grief smiled. \"I took you for a \\nthieving beachcomber, and not for a really intelligent pirate and murderer. Hence, \\nthe loss of my schooner. Honours are even, I fancy, on that score.\" \\n \\nRaoul flushed angrily under his sunburn, but he contained himself. His eyes \\nroved over the supply of food and the full water-calabashes, though he concealed \\nthe incredulous surprise he felt. His was a tall, slender, well-knit figure, and \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n57 \\nGrief, studying him, estimated his character from his face. The eyes were keen \\nand strong, but a bit too close together--not pinched, however, but just a trifle \\nnear to balance the broad forehead, the strong chin and jaw, and the cheekbones \\nwide apart. Strength! His face was filled with it, and yet Grief sensed in it the \\nintangible something the man lacked. \\n \\n\"We are both strong men,\" Raoul said, with a bow. \"We might have been fighting \\nfor empires a hundred years ago.\" \\n \\nIt was Grief\\'s turn to bow. \\n \\n\"As it is, we are squalidly scrapping over the enforcement of the colonial laws of \\nthose empires whose destinies we might possibly have determined a hundred \\nyears ago.\" \\n \\n\"It all comes to dust,\" Raoul remarked sen-tentiously, sitting down. \"Go ahead \\nwith your meal. Don\\'t let me interrupt.\" \\n \\n\"Won\\'t you join us?\" was Grief\\'s invitation. \\n \\nThe other looked at him with sharp steadiness, then accepted. \\n \\n\"I\\'m sticky with sweat,\" he said. \"Can I wash?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded and ordered Mauriri to bring a calabash. Raoul looked into the Goat \\nMan\\'s eyes, but saw nothing save languid uninterest as the precious quart of \\nwater was wasted on the ground. \\n \\n\"The dog is thirsty,\" Raoul said. \\n \\nGrief nodded, and another calabash was presented to the animal. \\n \\nAgain Raoul searched the eyes of the natives and learned nothing. \\n \\n\"Sorry we have no coffee,\" Grief apologized. \"You\\'ll have to drink plain water. A \\ncalabash, Tehaa. Try some of this shark. There is squid to follow, and sea urchins \\nand a seaweed salad. I\\'m sorry we haven\\'t any frigate bird. The boys were lazy \\nyesterday, and did not try to catch any.\" \\n \\nWith an appetite that would not have stopped at wire nails dipped in lard, Grief \\nate perfunctorily, and tossed the scraps to the dog. \\n \\n\"I\\'m afraid I haven\\'t got down to the primitive diet yet,\" he sighed, as he sat back. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n58 \\n\"The tinned goods on the Rattler, now I could make a hearty meal off of them, but \\nthis muck----\" He took a half-pound strip of broiled shark and flung it to the dog. \\n\"I suppose I\\'ll come to it if you don\\'t surrender pretty soon.\" \\n \\nRaoul laughed unpleasantly. \\n \\n\"I came to offer terms,\" he said pointedly. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"There aren\\'t any terms. I\\'ve got you where the hair is short, and I\\'m not going to \\nlet go.\" \\n \\n\"You think you can hold me in this hole!\" Raoul cried. \\n \\n\"You\\'ll never leave it alive, except in double irons.\" Grief surveyed his guest with \\nan air of consideration. \"I\\'ve handled your kind before. We\\'ve pretty well cleaned it \\nout of the South Seas. But you are a--how shall I say?--a sort of an anachronism. \\nYou\\'re a throwback, and we\\'ve got to get rid of you. Personally, I would advise you \\nto go back to the schooner and blow your brains out. It is the only way to escape \\nwhat you\\'ve got coming to you.\" \\n \\nThe parley, so far as Raoul was concerned, proved fruitless, and he went back \\ninto his own lines convinced that the men on the Big Rock could hold out for \\nyears, though he would have been swiftly unconvinced could he have observed \\nTehaa and the Raiateans, the moment his back was turned and he was out of \\nsight, crawling over the rocks and sucking and crunching the scraps his dog had \\nleft uneaten. \\n \\nIX \\n \\n\"We hunger now, Brother,\" Grief said, \"but it is better than to hunger for many \\ndays to come. The Big Devil, after feasting and drinking good water with us in \\nplenty, will not stay long in Fuatino. Even to-morrow may he try to leave. To-night \\nyou and I sleep over the top of the Rock, and Tehaa, who shoots well, will sleep \\nwith us if he can dare the Rock.\" \\n \\nTehaa, alone among the Raiateans, was cragsman enough to venture the perilous \\nway, and dawn found him in a rock-barricaded nook, a hundred yards to the \\nright of Grief and Mauriri. \\n \\nThe first warning was the firing of rifles from the peninsula, where Brown and his \\ntwo Raiateans signalled the retreat and followed the besiegers through the jungle \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n59 \\nto the beach. From the eyrie on the face of the rock Grief could see nothing for \\nanother hour, when the Rattler appeared, making for the passage. As before, the \\ncaptive Fuatino men towed in the whaleboat. Mauriri, under direction of Grief, \\ncalled down instructions to them as they passed slowly beneath. By Grief\\'s side \\nlay several bundles of dynamite sticks, well-lashed together and with extremely \\nshort fuses. \\n \\nThe deck of the Rattler was populous. For\\'ard, rifle in hand, among the Raiatean \\nsailors, stood a desperado whom Mauriri announced was Raoul\\'s brother. Aft, by \\nthe helmsman, stood another. Attached to him, tied waist to waist, with slack, \\nwas Mataara, the old Queen. On the other side of the helmsman, his arm in a \\nsling, was Captain Glass. Amidships, as before, was Raoul, and with him, lashed \\nwaist to waist, was Naumoo. \\n \\n\"Good morning, Mister David Grief,\" Raoul called up. \\n \\n\"And yet I warned you that only in double irons would you leave the island,\" Grief \\nmurmured down with a sad inflection. \\n \\n\"You can\\'t kill all your people I have on board,\" was the answer. \\n \\nThe schooner, moving slowly, jerk by jerk, as the men pulled in the whaleboat, \\nwas almost directly beneath. The rowers, without ceasing, slacked on their oars, \\nand were immediately threatened with the rifle of the man who stood for\\'ard. \\n \\n\"Throw, Big Brother!\" Naumoo called up in the Fuatino tongue. \"I am filled with \\nsorrow and am willed to die. His knife is ready with which to cut the rope, but I \\nshall hold him tight. Be not afraid, Big Brother. Throw, and throw straight, and \\ngood-bye.\" \\n \\nGrief hesitated, then lowered the fire-stick which he had been blowing bright. \\n \\n\"Throw!\" the Goat Man urged. \\n \\nStill Grief hesitated. \\n \\n\"If they get to sea, Big Brother, Naumoo dies just the same. And there are all the \\nothers. What is her life against the many?\" \\n \\n\"If you drop any dynamite, or fire a single shot, we\\'ll kill all on board,\" Raoul cried \\nup to them. \"I\\'ve got you, David Grief. You can\\'t kill these people, and I can. Shut \\nup, you!\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n60 \\nThis last was addressed to Naumoo, who was calling up in her native tongue and \\nwhom Raoul seized by the neck with one hand to choke to silence. In turn, she \\nlocked both arms about him and looked up beseechingly to Grief. \\n \\n\"Throw it, Mr. Grief, and be damned to them,\" Captain Glass rumbled in his deep \\nvoice. \"They\\'re bloody murderers, and the cabin\\'s full of them.\" \\n \\nThe desperado who was fastened to the old Queen swung half about to menace \\nCaptain Glass with his rifle, when Tehaa, from his position farther along the \\nRock, pulled trigger on him. The rifle dropped from the man\\'s hand, and on his \\nface was an expression of intense surprise as his legs crumpled under him and \\nhe sank down on deck, dragging the Queen with him. \\n \\n\"Port! Hard a port!\" Grief cried. \\n \\nCaptain Glass and the Kanaka whirled the wheel over, and the bow of the Rattler \\nheaded in for the Rock. Amidships Raoul still struggled with Naumoo. His brother \\nran from for\\'ard to his aid, being missed by the fusillade of quick shots from \\nTehaa and the Goat Man. As Raoul\\'s brother placed the muzzle of his rifle to \\nNaumoo\\'s side Grief touched the fire-stick to the match-head in the split end of \\nthe fuse. Even as with both hands he tossed the big bundle of dynamite, the rifle \\nwent off, and Naumoo\\'s fall to the deck was simultaneous with the fall of the \\ndynamite. This time the fuse was short enough. The explosion occurred at the \\ninstant the deck was reached, and that portion of the Rattler, along with Raoul, \\nhis brother, and Naumoo, forever disappeared. \\n \\nThe schooner\\'s side was shattered, and she began immediately to settle. For\\'ard, \\nevery Raiatean sailor dived overboard. Captain Glass met the first man springing \\nup the com-panionway from the cabin, with a kick full in the face, but was \\noverborne and trampled on by the rush. Following the desperadoes came the \\nHuahine women, and as they went overboard, the Rattler sank on an even keel \\nclose to the base of the Rock. Her cross-trees still stuck out when she reached \\nbottom. \\n \\nLooking down, Grief could see all that occurred beneath the surface. He saw \\nMataara, a fathom deep, unfasten herself from the dead pirate and swim upward. \\nAs her head emerged she saw Captain Glass, who could not swim, sinking several \\nyards away. The Queen, old woman that she was, but an islander, turned over, \\nswam down to him, and held him up as she struck out for the unsubmerged \\ncross-trees. \\n \\nFive heads, blond and brown, were mingled with the dark heads of Polynesia that \\ndotted the surface. Grief, rifle in hand, watched for a chance to shoot. The Goat \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n61 \\nMan, after a minute, was successful, and they saw the body of one man sink \\nsluggishly. But to the Raiatean sailors, big and brawny, half fish, was the \\nvengeance given. Swimming swiftly, they singled out the blond heads and the \\nbrown. Those from above watched the four surviving desperadoes, clutched and \\nlocked, dragged far down beneath and drowned like curs. \\n \\nIn ten minutes everything was over. The Huahine women, laughing and giggling, \\nwere holding on to the sides of the whaleboat which had done the towing. The \\nRaiatean sailors, waiting for orders, were about the cross-tree to which Captain \\nGlass and Mataara clung. \\n \\n\"The poor old Rattler,\" Captain Glass lamented. \\n \\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" Grief answered. \"In a week we\\'ll have her raised, new \\ntimbers amidships, and we\\'ll be on our way.\" And to the Queen, \"How is it with \\nyou, Sister?\" \\n \\n\"Naumoo is gone, and Motauri, Brother, but Fuatino is ours again. The day is \\nyoung. Word shall be sent to all my people in the high places with the goats. And \\nto-night, once again, and as never before, we shall feast and rejoice in the Big \\nHouse.\" \\n \\n\"She\\'s been needing new timbers abaft the beam there for years,\" quoth Captain \\nGlass. \"But the chronometers will be out of commission for the rest of the cruise.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n62 \\n \\nChapter Four--THE JOKERS OF NEW GIBBON \\n \\n I \\n \\n\"I\\'m almost afraid to take you in to New Gibbon,\" David Grief said. \"It wasn\\'t until \\nyou and the British gave me a free hand and let the place alone that any results \\nwere accomplished.\" \\n \\nWallenstein, the German Resident Commissioner from Bougainville, poured \\nhimself a long Scotch and soda and smiled. \\n \\n\"We take off our hats to you, Mr. Grief,\" he said in perfectly good English. \"What \\nyou have done on the devil island is a miracle.

We cut her \\ndown, but she died just the same. And staked out in the fresh running water, up \\nto their necks, were three more women. All their bones were broken and their \\njoints crushed. The process is supposed to make them tender for the eating. They \\nwere still alive. Their vitality was remarkable. One woman, the oldest, lingered \\nnearly ten days. Well, that was a sample of Koho\\'s diet. No wonder he\\'s a wild \\nbeast. How you ever pacified him is our everlasting puzzlement.\" \\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t call him exactly pacified,\" Grief answered. \"Though he comes in once \\nin a while and eats out of the hand.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s more than we accomplished with our cruisers. Neither the German nor \\nthe English ever laid eyes on him. You were the first.\" \\n \\n\"No; McTavish was the first,\" Grief disclaimed. \\n \\n\"Ah, yes, I remember him--the little, dried-up Scotchman.\" Wallenstein sipped his \\nwhiskey. \"He\\'s called the Trouble-mender, isn\\'t he?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"And they say the screw you pay him is bigger than mine or the British \\nResident\\'s?\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n63 \\n \\n\"I\\'m afraid it is,\" Grief admitted. \"You see, and no offence, he\\'s really worth it. He \\nspends his time wherever the trouble is. He is a wizard. He\\'s the one who got me \\nmy lodgment on New Gibbon. He\\'s down on Malaita now, starting a plantation for \\nme.\" \\n \\n\"The first?\" \\n \\n\"There\\'s not even a trading station on all Malaita. The recruiters still use covering \\nboats and carry the old barbed wire above their rails. There\\'s the plantation now. \\nWe\\'ll be in in half an hour.\" He handed the binoculars to his guest. \"Those are the \\nboat-sheds to the left of the bungalow. Beyond are the barracks. And to the right \\nare the copra-sheds. We dry quite a bit already. Old Koho\\'s getting civilized \\nenough to make his people bring in the nuts. There\\'s the mouth of the stream \\nwhere you found the three women softening.\" \\n \\nThe Wonder, wing-and-wing, was headed directly in for the anchorage. She rose \\nand fell lazily over a glassy swell flawed here and there by catspaws from astern. \\nIt was the tail-end of the monsoon season, and the air was heavy and sticky with \\ntropic moisture, the sky a florid, leaden muss of formless clouds. The rugged land \\nwas swathed with cloud-banks and squall wreaths, through which headlands and \\ninterior peaks thrust darkly. On one promontory a slant of sunshine blazed \\ntorridly, on another, scarcely a mile away, a squall was bursting in furious \\ndownpour of driving rain. \\n \\nThis was the dank, fat, savage island of New Gibbon, lying fifty miles to leeward of \\nChoiseul. Geographically, it belonged to the Solomon Group. Politically, the \\ndividing line of German and British influence cut it in half, hence the joint control \\nby the two Resident Commissioners. In the case of New Gibbon, this control \\nexisted only on paper in the colonial offices of the two countries. There was no \\nreal control at all, and never had been. The bêche de mer fishermen of the old \\ndays had passed it by. The sandalwood traders, after stern experiences, had given \\nit up. The blackbirders had never succeeded in recruiting one labourer on the \\nisland, and, after the schooner Dorset had been cut off with all hands, they left \\nthe place severely alone. Later, a German company had attempted a cocoanut \\nplantation, which was abandoned after several managers and a number of \\ncontract labourers had lost their heads. German cruisers and British cruisers \\nhad failed to get the savage blacks to listen to reason. Four times the missionary \\nsocieties had essayed the peaceful conquest of the island, and four times, \\nbetween sickness and massacre, they had been driven away, More cruisers, more \\npacifications, had followed, and followed fruitlessly. The cannibals had always \\nretreated into the bush and laughed at the screaming shells. When the warships \\nleft it was an easy matter to rebuild the burned grass houses and set up the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n64 \\novens in the old-fashioned way. \\n \\nNew Gibbon was a large island, fully one hundred and fifty miles long and half as \\nbroad. \\n \\nIts windward coast was iron-bound, without anchorages or inlets, and it was \\ninhabited by scores of warring tribes--at least it had been, until Koho had arisen, \\nlike a Kamehameha, and, by force of arms and considerable statecraft, firmly \\nwelded the greater portion of the tribes into a confederation. His policy of \\npermitting no intercourse with white men had been eminently right, so far as \\nsurvival of his own people was concerned; and after the visit of the last cruiser he \\nhad had his own way until David Grief and McTavish the Trouble-mender landed \\non the deserted beach where once had stood the German bungalow and barracks \\nand the various English mission-houses. \\n \\nFollowed wars, false peaces, and more wars. The weazened little Scotchman could \\nmake trouble as well as mend it, and, not content with holding the beach, he \\nimported bushmen from Malaita and invaded the wild-pig runs of the interior \\njungle. He burned villages until Koho wearied of rebuilding them, and when he \\ncaptured Koho\\'s eldest son he compelled a conference with the old chief. It was \\nthen that McTavish laid down the rate of head-exchange. For each head of his \\nown people he promised to take ten of Koho\\'s. After Koho had learned that the \\nScotchman was a man of his word, the first true peace was made. In the \\nmeantime McTavish had built the bungalow and barracks, cleared the jungle-\\nland along the beach, and laid out the plantation. After that he had gone on his \\nway to mend trouble on the atoll of Tasman, where a plague of black measles had \\nbroken out and been ascribed to Grief\\'s plantation by the devil-devil doctors. \\nOnce, a year later, he had been called back again to straighten up New Gibbon; \\nand Koho, after paying a forced fine of two hundred thousand cocoanuts, decided \\nit was cheaper to keep the peace and sell the nuts. Also, the fires of his youth had \\nburned down. He was getting old and limped of one leg where a Lee-Enfield bullet \\nhad perforated the calf. \\n \\nII \\n \\n\"I knew a chap in Hawaii,\" Grief said, \"superintendent of a sugar plantation, who \\nused a hammer and a ten-penny nail.\" \\n \\nThey were sitting on the broad bungalow veranda, and watching Worth, the \\nmanager of New Gibbon, doctoring the sick squad. They were New Georgia boys, a \\ndozen of them, and the one with the aching tooth had been put back to the last. \\nWorth had just failed in his first attempt. He wiped the sweat from his forehead \\nwith one hand and waved the forceps with the other. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n65 \\n \\n\"And broke more than one jaw,\" he asserted grimly. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. Wallenstein smiled and elevated his brows. \\n \\n\"He said not, at any rate,\" Grief qualified. \"He assured me, furthermore, that he \\nalways succeeded on the first trial.\" \\n \\n\"I saw it done when I was second mate on a lime-juicer,\" Captain Ward spoke up. \\n\"The old man used a caulking mallet and a steel marlin-spike. He took the tooth \\nout with the first stroke, too, clean as a whistle.\" \\n \\n\"Me for the forceps,\" Worth muttered grimly, inserting his own pair in the mouth \\nof the black. As he pulled, the man groaned and rose in the air. \"Lend a hand, \\nsomebody, and hold him down,\" the manager appealed. \\n \\nGrief and Wallenstein, on either side, gripped the black and held him. And he, in \\nturn, struggled against them and clenched his teeth on the forceps. The group \\nswayed back and forth. Such exertion, in the stagnant heat, brought the sweat \\nout on all of them. The black sweated, too, but his was the sweat of excruciating \\npain. The chair on which he sat was overturned. Captain Ward paused in the act \\nof pouring himself a drink, and called encouragement. Worth pleaded with his \\nassistants to hang on, and hung on himself, twisting the tooth till it crackled and \\nthen attempting a straightaway pull. \\n \\nNor did any of them notice the little black man who limped up the steps and \\nstood looking on. Koho was a conservative. His fathers before him had worn no \\nclothes, and neither did he, not even a gee-string. The many empty perforations \\nin nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions long since dead. The holes \\non both ear-lobes had been torn out, but their size was attested by the strips of \\nwithered flesh that hung down and swept his shoulders. He cared now only for \\nutility, and in one of the half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short \\nclay pipe. Around his waist was buckled a cheap trade-belt, and between the \\nimitation leather and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a long knife. \\nSuspended from the belt was his bamboo betel-nut and lime box. In his hand was \\na short-barrelled, large-bore Snider rifle. He was indescribably filthy, and here \\nand there marred by scars, the worst being the one left by the Lee-Enfield bullet, \\nwhich had withered the calf to half the size of its mate. His shrunken mouth \\nshowed that few teeth were left to serve him. Face and body were shrunken and \\nwithered, but his black, bead-like eyes, small and close together, were very \\nbright, withal they were restless and querulous, and more like a monkey\\'s than a \\nman\\'s. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n66 \\nHe looked on, grinning like a shrewd little ape. His joy in the torment of the \\npatient was natural, for the world he lived in was a world of pain. He had endured \\nhis share of it, and inflicted far more than his share on others. When the tooth \\nparted from its locked hold in the jaw and the forceps raked across the other \\nteeth and out of the mouth with a nerve-rasping sound, old Koho\\'s eyes fairly \\nsparkled, and he looked with glee at the poor black, collapsed on the veranda \\nfloor and groaning terribly as he held his head in both his hands. \\n \\n\"I think he\\'s going to faint,\" Grief said, bending over the victim. \"Captain Ward, \\ngive him a drink, please. You\\'d better take one yourself, Worth; you\\'re shaking \\nlike a leaf.\" \\n \\n\"And I think I\\'ll take one,\" said Wallenstein, wiping the sweat from his face. His \\neye caught the shadow of Koho on the floor and followed it up to the old chief \\nhimself. \"Hello! who\\'s this?\" \\n \\n\"Hello, Koho!\" Grief said genially, though he knew better than to offer to shake \\nhands. \\n \\nIt was one of Koho\\'s tambos, given him by the devil-devil doctors when he was \\nborn, that never was his flesh to come in contact with the flesh of a white man. \\nWorth and Captain Ward, of the Wonder, greeted Koho, but Worth frowned at \\nsight of the Snider, for it was one of his tambos that no visiting bushman should \\ncarry a weapon on the plantation. Rifles had a nasty way of going off at the hip \\nunder such circumstances. The manager clapped his hands, and a black house-\\nboy, recruited from San Cristobal, came running. At a sign from Worth, he took \\nthe rifle from the visitor\\'s hand and carried it inside the bungalow. \\n \\n\"Koho,\" Grief said, introducing the German Resident, \"this big fella marster \\nbelong Bougainville--my word, big fella marster too much.\" \\n \\nKoho, remembering the visits of the various German cruisers, smiled with a light \\nof unpleasant reminiscence in his eyes. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t shake hands with him, Wallenstein,\" Grief warned. \"Tambo, you know.\" \\nThen to Koho, \"My word, you get \\'m too much fat stop along you. Bime by you \\nmarry along new fella Mary, eh?\" \\n \\n\"Too old fella me,\" Koho answered, with a weary shake of the head. \"Me no like \\'m \\nMary. Me no like \\'m kai-kai (food). Close up me die along altogether.\" He stole a \\nsignificant glance at Worth, whose head was tilted back to a long glass. \"Me like \\n\\'m rum.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n67 \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"Tambo along black fella.\" \\n \\n\"He black fella no tambo,\" Koho retorted, nodding toward the groaning labourer. \\n \\n\"He fella sick,\" Grief explained. \\n \\n\"Me fella sick.\" \\n \\n\"You fella big liar,\" Grief laughed. \"Rum tambo, all the time tambo. Now, Koho, we \\nhave big fella talk along this big fella mar-ster.\" \\n \\nAnd he and Wallenstein and the old chief sat down on the veranda to confer \\nabout affairs of state. Koho was complimented on the peace he had kept, and he, \\nwith many protestations of his aged decrepitude, swore peace again and \\neverlasting. Then was discussed the matter of starting a German plantation \\ntwenty miles down the coast. The land, of course, was to be bought from Koho, \\nand the price was arranged in terms of tobacco, knives, beads, pipes, hatchets, \\nporpoise teeth and shell-money--in terms of everything except rum. While the talk \\nwent on, Koho, glancing through the window, could see Worth mixing medicines \\nand placing bottles back in the medicine cupboard. Also, he saw the manager \\ncomplete his labours by taking a drink of Scotch. Koho noted the bottle carefully. \\nAnd, though he hung about for an hour after the conference was over, there was \\nnever a moment when some one or another was not in the room. When Grief and \\nWorth sat down to a business talk, Koho gave it up. \\n \\n\"Me go along schooner,\" he announced, then turned and limped out. \\n \\n\"How are the mighty fallen,\" Grief laughed. \"To think that used to be Koho, the \\nfiercest red-handed murderer in the Solomons, who defied all his life two of the \\ngreatest world powers. And now he\\'s going aboard to try and cadge Denby for a \\ndrink.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n68 \\nIII \\n \\nFor the last time in his life the supercargo of the Wonder perpetrated a practical \\njoke on a native. He was in the main cabin, checking off the list of goods being \\nlanded in the whaleboats, when Koho limped down the com-panionway and took \\na seat opposite him at the table. \\n \\n\"Close up me die along altogether,\" was the burden of the old chief\\'s plaint. All \\nthe delights of the flesh had forsaken him. \"Me no like \\'m Mary. Me no like \\'m kai-\\nkai. Me too much sick fella. Me close up finish.\" A long, sad pause, in which his \\nface expressed unutterable concern for his stomach, which he patted gingerly and \\nwith an assumption of pain. \"Belly belong me too much sick.\" Another pause, \\nwhich was an invitation to Denby to make suggestions. Then followed a long, \\nweary, final sigh, and a \"Me like \\'m rum.\" \\n \\nDenby laughed heartlessly. He had been cadged for drinks before by the old \\ncannibal, and the sternest tambo Grief and McTavish had laid down was the one \\nforbidding alcohol to the natives of New Gibbon. \\n \\nThe trouble was that Koho had acquired the taste. In his younger days he had \\nlearned the delights of drunkenness when he cut off the schooner Dorset, but \\nunfortunately he had learned it along with all his tribesmen, and the supply had \\nnot held out long. Later, when he led his naked warriors down to the destruction \\nof the German plantation, he was wiser, and he appropriated all the liquors for \\nhis sole use. The result had been a gorgeous mixed drunk, on a dozen different \\nsorts of drink, ranging from beer doctored with quinine to absinthe and apricot \\nbrandy. The drunk had lasted for months, and it had left him with a thirst that \\nwould remain with him until he died. Predisposed toward alcohol, after the way of \\nsavages, all the chemistry of his flesh clamoured for it. This craving was to him \\nexpressed in terms of tingling and sensation, of maggots crawling warmly and \\ndeliciously in his brain, of good feeling, and well being, and high exultation. And \\nin his barren old age, when women and feasting were a weariness, and when old \\nhates had smouldered down, he desired more and more the revivifying fire that \\ncame liquid out of bottles--out of all sorts of bottles--for he remembered them \\nwell. He would sit in the sun for hours, occasionally drooling, in mournful \\ncontemplation of the great orgy which had been his when the German plantation \\nwas cleaned out. \\n \\nDenby was sympathetic. He sought out the old chief\\'s symptoms and offered him \\ndyspeptic tablets from the medicine chest, pills, and a varied assortment of \\nharmless tabloids and capsules. But Koho steadfastly declined. Once, when he \\ncut the Dorset off, he had bitten through a capsule of quinine; in addition, two of \\nhis warriors had partaken of a white powder and laid down and died very \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n69 \\nviolently in a very short time. No; he did not believe in drugs. But the liquids from \\nbottles, the cool-flaming youth-givers and warm-glowing dream-makers. No \\nwonder the white men valued them so highly and refused to dispense them. \\n \\n\"Rum he good fella,\" he repeated over and over, plaintively and with the weary \\npatience of age. \\n \\nAnd then Denby made his mistake and played his joke. Stepping around behind \\nKoho, he unlocked the medicine closet and took out a four-ounce bottle labelled \\nessence of mustard. As he made believe to draw the cork and drink of the \\ncontents, in the mirror on the for\\'ard bulkhead he glimpsed Koho, twisted half \\naround, intently watching him. Denby smacked his lips and cleared his throat \\nappreciatively as he replaced the bottle. Neglecting to relock the medicine closet, \\nhe returned to his chair, and, after a decent interval, went on deck. He stood \\nbeside the companionway and listened. After several moments the silence below \\nwas broken by a fearful, wheezing, propulsive, strangling cough. He smiled to \\nhimself and returned leisurely down the companionway. The bottle was back on \\nthe shelf where it belonged, and the old man sat in the same position. Denby \\nmarvelled at his iron control. Mouth and lips and tongue, and all sensitive \\nmembranes, were a blaze of fire. He gasped and nearly coughed several times, \\nwhile involuntary tears brimmed in his eyes and ran down his cheeks. An \\nordinary man would have coughed and strangled for half an hour. But old Koho\\'s \\nface was grimly composed. It dawned on him that a trick had been played, and \\ninto his eyes came an expression of hatred and malignancy so primitive, so \\nabysmal, that it sent the chills up and down Denby\\'s spine. Koho arose proudly. \\n \\n\"Me go along,\" he said. \"You sing out one fella boat stop along me.\" \\n \\nIV \\n \\nHaving seen Grief and Worth start for a ride over the plantation, Wallenstein sat \\ndown in the big living-room and with gun-oil and old rags proceeded to take apart \\nand clean his automatic pistol. On the table beside him stood the inevitable bottle \\nof Scotch and numerous soda bottles. Another bottle, part full, chanced to stand \\nthere. It was also labelled Scotch, but its content was liniment which Worth had \\nmixed for the horses and neglected to put away. \\n \\nAs Wallenstein worked, he glanced through the window and saw Koho coming up \\nthe compound path. He was limping very rapidly, but when he came along the \\nveranda and entered the room his gait was slow and dignified. He sat down and \\nwatched the gun-cleaning, Though mouth and lips and tongue were afire, he gave \\nno sign. At the end of five minutes he spoke. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n70 \\n\"Rum he good fella. Me like \\'m rum.\" Wallenstein smiled and shook his head, and \\nthen it was that his perverse imp suggested what was to be his last joke on a \\nnative. The similarity of the two bottles was the real suggestion. He laid his pistol \\nparts on the table and mixed himself a long drink. Standing as he did between \\nKoho and the table, he interchanged the two bottles, drained his glass, made as if \\nto search for something, and left the room. From outside he heard the surprised \\nsplutter and cough; but when he returned the old chief sat as before. The \\nliniment in the bottle, however, was lower, and it still oscillated. \\n \\nKoho stood up, clapped his hands, and, when the house-boy answered, signed \\nthat he desired his rifle. The boy fetched the weapon, and according to custom \\npreceded the visitor down the pathway. Not until outside the gate did the boy \\nturn the rifle over to its owner. Wallenstein, chuckling to himself, watched the old \\nchief limp along the beach in the direction of the river. \\n \\nA few minutes later, as he put his pistol together, Wallenstein heard the distant \\nreport of a gun. For the instant he thought of Koho, then dismissed the \\nconjecture from his mind. Worth and Grief had taken shotguns with them, and it \\nwas probably one of their shots at a pigeon. Wallenstein lounged back in his \\nchair, chuckled, twisted his yellow mustache, and dozed. He was aroused by the \\nexcited voice of Worth, crying out: \\n \\n\"Ring the big fella bell! Ring plenty too much! Ring like hell!\" \\n \\nWallenstein gained the veranda in time to see the manager jump his horse over \\nthe low fence of the compound and dash down the beach after Grief, who was \\nriding madly ahead. A loud crackling and smoke rising through the cocoanut \\ntrees told the story. The boat-houses and the barracks were on fire. The big \\nplantation bell was ringing wildly as the German Resident ran down the beach, \\nand he could see whaleboats hastily putting off from the schooner. \\n \\nBarracks and boat-houses, grass-thatched and like tinder, were wrapped in \\nflames. Grief emerged from the kitchen, carrying a naked black child by the leg. \\nIts head was missing. \\n \\n\"The cook\\'s in there,\" he told Worth. \"Her head\\'s gone, too. She was too heavy, \\nand I had to clear out.\" \\n \\n\"It was my fault,\" Wallenstein said. \"Old Koho did it. But I let him take a drink of \\nWorth\\'s horse liniment.\" \\n \\n\"I guess he\\'s headed for the bush,\" Worth said, springing astride his horse and \\nstarting. \"Oliver is down there by the river. Hope he didn\\'t get him.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n71 \\n \\nThe manager galloped away through the trees. A few minutes later, as the \\ncharred wreck of the barracks crashed in, they heard him calling and followed. \\nOn the edge of the river bank they came upon him. He still sat on his horse, very \\nwhite-faced, and gazed at something on the ground. It was the body of Oliver, the \\nyoung assistant manager, though it was hard to realize it, for the head was gone. \\nThe black labourers, breathless from their run in from the fields, were now \\ncrowding around, and under conches to-night, and the war-drums, \"all merry hell \\nwill break loose. They won\\'t rush us, but keep all the boys close up to the house, \\nMr. Worth. Come on!\" \\n \\nAs they returned along the path they came upon a black who whimpered and \\ncried vociferously. \\n \\n\"Shut up mouth belong you!\" Worth shouted. \"What name you make \\'m noise?\" \\n \\n\"Him fella Koho finish along two fella bulla-macow,\" the black answered, drawing \\na forefinger significantly across his throat. \\n \\n\"He\\'s knifed the cows,\" Grief said. \"That means no more milk for some time for \\nyou, Worth. I\\'ll see about sending a couple up from Ugi.\" \\n \\nWallenstein proved inconsolable, until Denby, coming ashore, confessed to the \\ndose of essence of mustard. Thereat the German Resident became even cheerful, \\nthough he twisted his yellow mustache up more fiercely and continued to curse \\nthe Solomons with oaths culled from four languages. \\n \\nNext morning, visible from the masthead of the Wonder, the bush was alive with \\nsignal-smokes. From promontory to promontory, and back through the solid \\njungle, the smoke-pillars curled and puffed and talked. Remote villages on the \\nhigher peaks, beyond the farthest raids McTavish had ever driven, joined in the \\ntroubled conversation. From across the river persisted a bedlam of conches; while \\nfrom everywhere, drifting for miles along the quiet air, came the deep, booming \\nreverberations of the great war-drums--huge tree trunks, hollowed by fire and \\ncarved with tools of stone and shell. \"You\\'re all right as long as you stay close,\" \\nGrief told his manager. \"I\\'ve got to get along to Guvutu. They won\\'t come out in \\nthe open and attack you. Keep the work-gangs close. Stop the clearing till this \\nblows over. They\\'ll get any detached gangs you send out. And, whatever you do, \\ndon\\'t be fooled into going into the bush after Koho. If you do, he\\'ll get you. All \\nyou\\'ve got to do is wait for McTavish. I\\'ll send him up with a bunch of his Malaita \\nbush-men. He\\'s the only man who can go inside. Also, until he comes, I\\'ll leave \\nDenby with you. You don\\'t mind, do you, Mr. Denby? I\\'ll send McTavish up with \\nthe Wanda, and you can go back on her and rejoin the Wonder. Captain Ward \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n72 \\ncan manage without you for a trip.\" \\n \\n\"It was just what I was going to volunteer,\" Denby answered. \"I never dreamed all \\nthis muss would be kicked up over a joke. You see, in a way I consider myself \\nresponsible for it.\" \\n \\n\"So am I responsible,\" Wallenstein broke in. \\n \\n\"But I started it,\" the supercargo urged. \\n \\n\"Maybe you did, but I carried it along.\" \\n \\n\"And Koho finished it,\" Grief said. \\n \\n\"At any rate, I, too, shall remain,\" said the German. \\n \\n\"I thought you were coming to Guvutu with me,\" Grief protested. \\n \\n\"I was. But this is my jurisdiction, partly, and I have made a fool of myself in it \\ncompletely. I shall remain and help get things straight again.\" \\n \\nAt Guvutu, Grief sent full instructions to McTavish by a recruiting ketch which \\nwas just starting for Malaita. Captain Ward sailed in the Wonder for the Santa \\nCruz Islands; and Grief, borrowing a whaleboat and a crew of black prisoners \\nfrom the British Resident, crossed the channel to Guadalcanar, to examine the \\ngrass lands back of Penduffryn. \\n \\nThree weeks later, with a free sheet and a lusty breeze, he threaded the coral \\npatches and surged up the smooth water to Guvutu anchorage. The harbour was \\ndeserted, save for a small ketch which lay close in to the shore reef. Grief \\nrecognized it as the Wanda. She had evidently just got in by the Tulagi Passage, \\nfor her black crew was still at work furling the sails. As he rounded alongside, \\nMcTavish himself extended a hand to help him over the rail. \\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" Grief asked. \"Haven\\'t you started yet?\" \\n \\nMcTavish nodded. \"And got back. Everything\\'s all right on board.\" \\n \\n\"How\\'s New Gibbon?\" \\n \\n\"All there, the last I saw of it, barrin\\' a few inconsequential frills that a good eye \\ncould make out lacking from the landscape.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n73 \\nHe was a cold flame of a man, small as Koho, and as dried up, with a mahogany \\ncomplexion and small, expressionless blue eyes that were more like gimlet-points \\nthan the eyes of a Scotchman. Without fear, without enthusiasm, impervious to \\ndisease and climate and sentiment, he was lean and bitter and deadly as a snake. \\nThat his present sour look boded ill news, Grief was well aware. \\n \\n\"Spit it out!\" he said. \"What\\'s happened?\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis a thing severely to be condemned, a damned shame, this joking with \\nheathen niggers,\" was the reply. \"Also, \\'tis very expensive. Come below, Mr. Grief. \\nYou\\'ll be better for the information with a long glass in your hand. After you.\" \\n \\n\"How did you settle things?\" his employer demanded as soon as they were seated \\nin the cabin. \\n \\nThe little Scotchman shook his head. \"There was nothing to settle. It all depends \\nhow you look at it. The other way would be to say it was settled, entirely settled, \\nmind you, before I got there.\" \\n \\n\"But the plantation, man? The plantation?\" \\n \\n\"No plantation. All the years of our work have gone for naught. \\'Tis back where we \\nstarted, where the missionaries started, where the Germans started--and where \\nthey finished. Not a stone stands on another at the landing pier. The houses are \\nblack ashes. Every tree is hacked down, and the wild pigs are rooting out the \\nyams and sweet potatoes. Those boys from New Georgia, a fine bunch they were, \\nfive score of them, and they cost you a pretty penny. Not one is left to tell the \\ntale.\" \\n \\nHe paused and began fumbling in a large locker under the companion-steps. \\n \\n\"But Worth? And Denby? And Wallenstein?\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s what I\\'m telling you. Take a look.\" \\n \\nMcTavish dragged out a sack made of rice matting and emptied its contents on \\nthe floor. David Grief pulled himself together with a jerk, for he found himself \\ngazing fascinated at the heads of the three men he had left at New Gibbon. The \\nyellow mustache of Wallenstein had lost its fierce curl and drooped and wilted on \\nthe upper lip. \\n \\n\"I don\\'t know how it happened,\" the Scotchman\\'s voice went on drearily. \"But I \\nsurmise they went into the bush after the old devil.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n74 \\n \\n\"And where is Koho?\" Grief asked. \\n \\n\"Back in the bush and drunk as a lord. That\\'s how I was able to recover the \\nheads. He was too drunk to stand. They lugged him on their backs out of the \\nvillage when I rushed it. And if you\\'ll relieve me of the heads, I\\'ll be well obliged.\" \\nHe paused and sighed. \"I suppose they\\'ll have regular funerals over them and put \\nthem in the ground. But in my way of thinking they\\'d make excellent curios. Any \\nrespectable museum would pay a hundred quid apiece. Better have another \\ndrink. You\\'re looking a bit pale---- There, put that down you, and if you\\'ll take my \\nadvice, Mr. Grief, I would say, set your face sternly against any joking with the \\nniggers. It always makes trouble, and it is a very expensive divertisement.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n75 \\n \\nChapter Five--A LITTLE ACCOUNT WITH SWITHIN HALL \\n \\n I \\n \\nWith a last long scrutiny at the unbroken circle of the sea, David Grief swung out \\nof the cross-trees and slowly and dejectedly descended the ratlines to the deck. \\n \\n\"Leu-Leu Atoll is sunk, Mr. Snow,\" he said to the anxious-faced young mate. \"If \\nthere is anything in navigation, the atoll is surely under the sea, for we\\'ve sailed \\nclear over it twice--or the spot where it ought to be. It\\'s either that or the \\nchronometer\\'s gone wrong, or I\\'ve forgotten my navigation.\" \\n \\n\"It must be the chronometer, sir,\" the mate reassured his owner. \"You know I \\nmade separate sights and worked them up, and that they agreed with yours.\" \\n \\n\"Yes,\" Grief muttered, nodding glumly, \"and where your Summer lines crossed, \\nand mine, too, was the dead centre of Leu-Leu Atoll. It must be the chronometer--\\nslipped a cog or something.\" \\n \\nHe made a short pace to the rail and back, and cast a troubled eye at the Uncle \\nToby\\'s wake. The schooner, with a fairly strong breeze on her quarter, was logging \\nnine or ten knots. \\n \\n\"Better bring her up on the wind, Mr. Snow. Put her under easy sail and let her \\nwork to windward on two-hour legs. It\\'s thickening up, and I don\\'t imagine we \\ncan get a star observation to-night; so we\\'ll just hold our weather position, get a \\nlatitude sight to-morrow, and run Leu-Leu down on her own latitude. That\\'s the \\nway all the old navigators did.\" \\n \\nBroad of beam, heavily sparred, with high freeboard and bluff, Dutchy bow, the \\nUncle Toby was the slowest, tubbiest, safest, and most fool-proof schooner David \\nGrief possessed. Her run was in the Banks and Santa Cruz groups and to the \\nnorthwest among the several isolated atolls where his native traders collected \\ncopra, hawksbill turtle, and an occasional ton of pearl shell. Finding the skipper \\ndown with a particularly bad stroke of fever, Grief had relieved him and taken the \\nUncle Toby on her semiannual run to the atolls. He had elected to make his first \\ncall at Leu-Leu, which lay farthest, and now found himself lost at sea with a \\nchronometer that played tricks. \\n \\nII \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n76 \\nNo stars showed that night, nor was the sun visible next day. A stuffy, sticky \\ncalm obtained, broken by big wind-squalls and heavy downpours. From fear of \\nworking too far to windward, the Uncle Toby was hove to, and four days and \\nnights of cloud-hidden sky followed. Never did the sun appear, and on the several \\noccasions that stars broke through they were too dim and fleeting for \\nidentification. By this time it was patent to the veriest tyro that the elements were \\npreparing to break loose. Grief, coming on deck from consulting the barometer, \\nwhich steadfastly remained at 29.90, encountered Jackie-Jackie, whose face was \\nas brooding and troublous as the sky and air. Jackie-Jackie, a Tongan sailor of \\nexperience, served as a sort of bosun and semi-second mate over the mixed \\nKanaka crew. \\n \\n\"Big weather he come, I think,\" he said. \"I see him just the same before maybe \\nfive, six times.\" \\n \\nGrief nodded. \"Hurricane weather, all right, Jackie-Jackie. Pretty soon barometer \\ngo down--bottom fall out.\" \\n \\n\"Sure,\" the Tongan concurred. \"He goin\\' to blow like hell.\" \\n \\nTen minutes later Snow came on deck. \\n \\n\"She\\'s started,\" he said; \"29.85, going down and pumping at the same time. It\\'s \\nstinking hot--don\\'t you notice it?\" He brushed his forehead with his hands. \"It\\'s \\nsickening. I could lose my breakfast without trying.\" \\n \\nJackie-Jackie grinned. \"Just the same me. Everything inside walk about. Always \\nthis way before big blow. But Uncle Toby all right. He go through anything.\" \\n \\n\"Better rig that storm-trysail on the main, and a storm-jib,\" Grief said to the \\nmate. \"And put all the reefs into the working canvas before you furl down. No \\ntelling what we may need. Put on double gaskets while you\\'re about it.\" \\n \\nIn another hour, the sultry oppressiveness steadily increasing and the stark calm \\nstill continuing, the barometer had fallen to 29.70. The mate, being young, lacked \\nthe patience of waiting for the portentous. He ceased his restless pacing, and \\nwaved his arms. \\n \\n\"If she\\'s going to come let her come!\" he cried. \"There\\'s no use shilly-shallying this \\nway! Whatever the worst is, let us know it and have it! A pretty pickle--lost with a \\ncrazy chronometer and a hurricane that won\\'t blow!\" \\n \\nThe cloud-mussed sky turned to a vague copper colour, and seemed to glow as \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n77 \\nthe inside of a huge heated caldron. Nobody remained below. The native sailors \\nformed in anxious groups amidships and for\\'ard, where they talked in low voices \\nand gazed apprehensively at the ominous sky and the equally ominous sea that \\nbreathed in long, low, oily undulations. \\n \\n\"Looks like petroleum mixed with castor oil,\" the mate grumbled, as he spat his \\ndisgust overside. \"My mother used to dose me with messes like that when I was a \\nkid. Lord, she\\'s getting black!\" \\n \\nThe lurid coppery glow had vanished, and the sky thickened and lowered until \\nthe darkness was as that of a late twilight. David Grief, who well knew the \\nhurricane rules, nevertheless reread the \"Laws of Storms,\" screwing his eyes in \\nthe faint light in order to see the print. There was nothing to be done save wait for \\nthe wind, so that he might know how he lay in relation to the fast-flying and \\ndeadly centre that from somewhere was approaching out of the gloom. \\n \\nIt was three in the afternoon, and the glass had sunk to 29:45, when the wind \\ncame. They could see it on the water, darkening the face of the sea, crisping tiny \\nwhitecaps as it rushed along. It was merely a stiff breeze, and the Uncle Toby, \\nfilling away under her storm canvas till the wind was abeam, sloshed along at a \\nfour-knot gait. \\n \\n\"No weight to that,\" Snow sneered. \"And after such grand preparation!\" \\n \\n\"Pickaninny wind,\" Jackie-Jackie agreed. \"He grow big man pretty quick, you \\nsee.\" \\n \\nGrief ordered the foresail put on, retaining the reefs, and the Uncle Toby mended \\nher pace in the rising breeze. The wind quickly grew to man\\'s size, but did not \\nstop there. It merely blew hard, and harder, and kept on blowing harder, \\nadvertising each increase by lulls followed by fierce, freshening gusts. Ever it \\ngrew, until the Uncle Toby\\'s rail was more often pressed under than not, while \\nher waist boiled with foaming water which the scuppers could not carry off. Grief \\nstudied the barometer, still steadily falling. \\n \\n\"The centre is to the southward,\" he told Snow, \"and we\\'re running across its \\npath and into it. Now we\\'ll turn about and run the other way. That ought to bring \\nthe glass up. Take in the foresail--it\\'s more than she can carry already--and stand \\nby to wear her around.\" \\n \\nThe maneuver was accomplished, and through the gloom that was almost that of \\nthe first darkness of evening the Uncle Toby turned and raced madly north across \\nthe face of the storm. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n78 \\n \\n\"It\\'s nip and tuck,\" Grief confided to the mate a couple of hours later. \"The \\nstorm\\'s swinging a big curve--there\\'s no calculating that curve--and we may win \\nacross or the centre may catch us. Thank the Lord, the glass is holding its own. It \\nall depends on how big the curve is. The sea\\'s too big for us to keep on. Heave her \\nto! She\\'ll keep working along out anyway.\" \\n \\n\"I thought I knew what wind was,\" Snow shouted in his owner\\'s ear next morning. \\n\"This isn\\'t wind. It\\'s something unthinkable. It\\'s impossible. It must reach ninety \\nor a hundred miles an hour in the gusts. That don\\'t mean anything. How could I \\never tell it to anybody? I couldn\\'t. And look at that sea! I\\'ve run my Easting down, \\nbut I never saw anything like that.\" \\n \\nDay had come, and the sun should have been up an hour, yet the best it could \\nproduce was a sombre semi-twilight. The ocean was a stately procession of \\nmoving mountains. A third of a mile across yawned the valleys between the great \\nwaves. Their long slopes, shielded somewhat from the full fury of the wind, were \\nbroken by systems of smaller whitecapping waves, but from the high crests of the \\nbig waves themselves the wind tore the whitecaps in the forming. This spume \\ndrove masthead high, and higher, horizontally, above the surface of the sea. \\n \\n\"We\\'re through the worst,\" was Grief\\'s judgment. \"The glass is coming along all \\nthe time. The sea will get bigger as the wind eases down. I\\'m going to turn in. \\nWatch for shifts in the wind. They\\'ll be sure to come. Call me at eight bells.\" \\n \\nBy mid-afternoon, in a huge sea, with the wind after its last shift no more than a \\nstiff breeze, the Tongan bosun sighted a schooner bottom up. The Uncle Toby\\'s \\ndrift took them across the bow and they could not make out the name; but before \\nnight they picked up with a small, round-bottom, double-ender boat, swamped \\nbut with white lettering visible on its bow. Through the binoculars, Gray made \\nout: Emily L No. 3. \\n \\n\"A sealing schooner,\" Grief said. \"But what a sealer\\'s doing in these waters is \\nbeyond me.\" \\n \\n\"Treasure-hunters, maybe?\" Snow speculated. \"The Sophie Sutherland and the \\nHerman were sealers, you remember, chartered out of San Francisco by the \\nchaps with the maps who can always go right to the spot until they get there and \\ndon\\'t.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nAfter a giddy night of grand and lofty tumbling, in which, over a big and dying \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n79 \\nsea, without a breath of wind to steady her, the Uncle Toby rolled every person on \\nboard sick of soul, a light breeze sprang up and the reefs were shaken out. By \\nmidday, on a smooth ocean floor, the clouds thinned and cleared and sights of \\nthe sun were obtained. Two degrees and fifteen minutes south, the observation \\ngave them. With a broken chronometer longitude was out of the question. \\n \\n\"We\\'re anywhere within five hundred and a thousand miles along that latitude \\nline,\" Grief remarked, as he and the mate bent over the chart. \\n \\n\"Leu-Leu is to the south\\'ard somewhere, and this section of ocean is all blank. \\nThere is neither an island nor a reef by which we can regulate the chronometer. \\nThe only thing to do--\" \\n \\n\"Land ho, skipper!\" the Tongan called down the companionway. \\n \\nGrief took a quick glance at the empty blank of the chart, whistled his surprise, \\nand sank back feebly in a chair. \\n \\n\"It gets me,\" he said. \"There can\\'t be land around here. We never drifted or ran \\nlike that. The whole voyage has been crazy. Will you kindly go up, Mr. Snow, and \\nsee what\\'s ailing Jackie.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s land all right,\" the mate called down a minute afterward. \"You can see it from \\nthe deck--tops of cocoanuts--an atoll of some sort. Maybe it\\'s Leu-Leu after all.\" \\n \\nGrief shook his head positively as he gazed at the fringe of palms, only the tops \\nvisible, apparently rising out of the sea. \\n \\n\"Haul up on the wind, Mr. Snow, close-and-by, and we\\'ll take a look. We can just \\nreach past to the south, and if it spreads off in that direction we\\'ll hit the \\nsouthwest corner.\" \\n \\nVery near must palms be to be seen from the low deck of a schooner, and, slowly \\nas the Uncle Toby sailed, she quickly raised the low land above the sea, while \\nmore palms increased the definition of the atoll circle. \\n \\n\"She\\'s a beauty,\" the mate remarked. \"A perfect circle.... Looks as if it might be \\neight or nine miles across.... Wonder if there\\'s an entrance to the lagoon.... Who \\nknows? Maybe it\\'s a brand new find.\" \\n \\nThey coasted up the west side of the atoll, making short tacks in to the surf-\\npounded coral rock and out again. From the masthead, across the palm-fringe, a \\nKanaka announced the lagoon and a small island in the middle. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n80 \\n \\n\"I know what you\\'re thinking,\" Grief said to his mate. \\n \\nSnow, who had been muttering and shaking his head, looked up with quick and \\nchallenging incredulity. \\n \\n\"You\\'re thinking the entrance will be on the northwest.\" Grief went on, as if \\nreciting. \\n \\n\"Two cable lengths wide, marked on the north by three separated cocoanuts, and \\non the south by pandanus trees. Eight miles in diameter, a perfect circle, with an \\nisland in the dead centre.\" \\n \\n\"I was thinking that,\" Snow acknowledged. \\n \\n\"And there\\'s the entrance opening up just where it ought to be----\" \\n \\n\"And the three palms,\" Snow almost whispered, \"and the pandanus trees. If \\nthere\\'s a windmill on the island, it\\'s it--Swithin Hall\\'s island. But it can\\'t be. \\nEverybody\\'s been looking for it for the last ten years.\" \\n \\n\"Hall played you a dirty trick once, didn\\'t he?\" Grief queried. \\n \\nSnow nodded. \"That\\'s why I\\'m working for you. He broke me flat. It was \\ndownright robbery. I bought the wreck of the Cascade, down in Sydney, out of a \\nfirst instalment of a legacy from home.\" \\n \\n\"She went on Christmas Island, didn\\'t she?\" \\n \\n\"Yes, full tilt, high and dry, in the night. They saved the passengers and mails. \\nThen I bought a little island schooner, which took the rest of my money, and I \\nhad to wait the final payment by the executors to fit her out. What did Swithin \\nHall do--he was at Honolulu at the time--but make a straightaway run for \\nChristmas Island. Neither right nor title did he have. When I got there, the hull \\nand engines were all that was left of the Cascade. She had had a fair shipment of \\nsilk on board, too. And it wasn\\'t even damaged. I got it afterward pretty straight \\nfrom his supercargo. He cleared something like sixty thousand dollars.\" \\n \\nSnow shrugged his shoulders and gazed bleakly at the smooth surface of the \\nlagoon, where tiny wavelets danced in the afternoon sun. \\n \\n\"The wreck was mine. I bought her at public auction. I\\'d gambled big, and I\\'d lost. \\nWhen I got back to Sydney, the crew, and some of the tradesmen who\\'d extended \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n81 \\nme credit, libelled the schooner. I pawned my watch and sextant, and shovelled \\ncoal one spell, and finally got a billet in the New Hebrides on a screw of eight \\npounds a month. Then I tried my luck as independent trader, went broke, took a \\nmate\\'s billet on a recruiter down to Tanna and over to Fiji, got a job as overseer \\non a German plantation back of Apia, and finally settled down on the Uncle \\nToby.\" \\n \\n\"Have you ever met Swithin Hall?\" \\n \\nSnow shook his head. \\n \\n\"Well, you\\'re likely to meet him now. There\\'s the windmill.\" \\n \\nIn the centre of the lagoon, as they emerged from the passage, they opened a \\nsmall, densely wooded island, among the trees of which a large Dutch windmill \\nshowed plainly. \\n \\n\"Nobody at home from the looks of it,\" Grief said, \"or you might have a chance to \\ncollect.\" \\n \\nThe mate\\'s face set vindictively, and his fists clenched. \\n \\n\"Can\\'t touch him legally. He\\'s got too much money now. But I can take sixty \\nthousand dollars\\' worth out of his hide. I hope he is at home.\" \\n \\n\"Then I hope he is, too,\" Grief said, with an appreciative smile. \"You got the \\ndescription of his island from Bau-Oti, I suppose?\" \\n \\n\"Yes, as pretty well everybody else has. The trouble is that Bau-Oti can\\'t give \\nlatitude or longitude. Says they sailed a long way from the Gilberts--that\\'s all he \\nknows. I wonder what became of him.\" \\n \\n\"I saw him a year ago on the beach at Tahiti. Said he was thinking about shipping \\nfor a cruise through the Paumotus. Well, here we are, getting close in. Heave the \\nlead, Jackie-Jackie. Stand by to let go, Mr. Snow. According to Bau-Oti, \\nanchorage three hundred yards off the west shore in nine fathoms, coral patches \\nto the southeast. There are the patches. What do you get, Jackie?\" \\n \\n\"Nine fadom.\" \\n \\n\"Let go, Mr. Snow.\" \\n \\nThe Uncle Toby swung to her chain, head-sails ran down, and the Kanaka crew \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n82 \\nsprang to fore and main-halyards and sheets. \\n \\nIV \\n \\nThe whaleboat laid alongside the small, coral-stone landing-pier, and David Grief \\nand his mate stepped ashore. \\n \\n\"You\\'d think the place deserted,\" Grief said, as they walked up a sanded path to \\nthe bungalow. \"But I smell a smell that I\\'ve often smelled. Something doing, or my \\nnose is a liar. The lagoon is carpeted with shell. They\\'re rotting the meat out not a \\nthousand miles away. Get that whiff?\" \\n \\nLike no bungalow in the tropics was this bungalow of Swithin Hall. Of mission \\narchitecture, when they had entered through the unlatched screen door they \\nfound decoration and furniture of the same mission style. The floor of the big \\nliving-room was covered with the finest Samoan mats. There were couches, \\nwindow seats, cozy corners, and a billiard table. A sewing table, and a sewing-\\nbasket, spilling over with sheer linen in the French embroidery of which stuck a \\nneedle, tokened a woman\\'s presence. By screen and veranda the blinding \\nsunshine was subdued to a cool, dim radiance. The sheen of pearl push-buttons \\ncaught Grief\\'s eye. \\n \\n\"Storage batteries, by George, run by the windmill!\" he exclaimed as he pressed \\nthe buttons. \"And concealed lighting!\" \\n \\nHidden bowls glowed, and the room was filled with diffused golden light. Many \\nshelves of books lined the walls. Grief fell to running over their titles. A fairly well-\\nread man himself, for a sea-adventurer, he glimpsed a wide-ness of range and \\ncatholicity of taste that were beyond him. Old friends he met, and others that he \\nhad heard of but never read. There were complete sets of Tolstoy, Turgenieff, and \\nGorky; of Cooper and Mark Twain; of Hugo, and Zola, and Sue; and of Flaubert, \\nDe Maupassant, and Paul de Koch. He glanced curiously at the pages of \\nMetchnikoff, Weininger, and Schopenhauer, and wonderingly at those of Ellis, \\nLydston, Krafft-Ebbing, and Forel. Woodruff\\'s \"Expansion of Races\" was in his \\nhands when Snow returned from further exploration of the house. \\n \\n\"Enamelled bath-tub, separate room for a shower, and a sitz-bath!\" he exclaimed. \\n\"Fitted up for a king! And I reckon some of my money went to pay for it. The place \\nmust be occupied. I found fresh-opened butter and milk tins in the pantry, and \\nfresh turtle-meat hanging up. I\\'m going to see what else I can find.\" \\n \\nGrief, too, departed, through a door that led out of the opposite end of the living-\\nroom. He found himself in a self-evident woman\\'s bedroom. Across it, he peered \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n83 \\nthrough a wire-mesh door into a screened and darkened sleeping porch. On a \\ncouch lay a woman asleep. In the soft light she seemed remarkably beautiful in a \\ndark Spanish way. By her side, opened and face downward, a novel lay on a \\nchair. From the colour in her cheeks, Grief concluded that she had not been long \\nin the tropics. After the one glimpse he stole softly back, in time to see Snow \\nentering the living-room through the other door. By the naked arm he was \\nclutching an age-wrinkled black who grinned in fear and made signs of \\ndumbness. \\n \\n\"I found him snoozing in a little kennel out back,\" the mate said. \"He\\'s the cook, I \\nsuppose. Can\\'t get a word out of him. What did you find?\" \\n \\n\"A sleeping princess. S-sh! There\\'s somebody now.\" \\n \\n\"If it\\'s Hall,\" Snow muttered, clenching his fist. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"No rough-house. There\\'s a woman here. And if it is Hall, \\nbefore we go I\\'ll maneuver a chance for you to get action.\" \\n \\nThe door opened, and a large, heavily built man entered. In his belt was a heavy, \\nlong-barrelled Colt\\'s. One quick, anxious look he gave them, then his face \\nwreathed in a genial smile and his hand was extended. \\n \\n\"Welcome, strangers. But if you don\\'t mind my asking, how, by all that\\'s sacred, \\ndid you ever manage to find my island?\" \\n \\n\"Because we were out of our course,\" Grief answered, shaking hands. \\n \\n\"My name\\'s Hall, Swithin Hall,\" the other said, turning to shake Snow\\'s hand. \\n\"And I don\\'t mind telling you that you\\'re the first visitors I\\'ve ever had.\" \\n \\n\"And this is your secret island that\\'s had all the beaches talking for years?\" Grief \\nanswered. \"Well, I know the formula now for finding it.\" \\n \\n\"How\\'s that?\" Hall asked quickly. \\n \\n\"Smash your chronometer, get mixed up with a hurricane, and then keep your \\neyes open for cocoanuts rising out of the sea.\" \\n \\n\"And what is your name?\" Hall asked, after he had laughed perfunctorily. \\n \\n\"Anstey--Phil Anstey,\" Grief answered promptly. \"Bound on the Uncle Toby from \\nthe Gilberts to New Guinea, and trying to find my longitude. This is my mate, Mr. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n84 \\nGray, a better navigator than I, but who has lost his goat just the same to the \\nchronometer.\" \\n \\nGrief did not know his reason for lying, but he had felt the prompting and \\nsuccumbed to it. He vaguely divined that something was wrong, but could not \\nplace his finger on it. Swithin Hall was a fat, round-faced man, with a laughing \\nlip and laughter-wrinkles in the corners of his eyes. But Grief, in his early youth, \\nhad learned how deceptive this type could prove, as well as the deceptiveness of \\nblue eyes that screened the surface with fun and hid what went on behind. \\n \\n\"What are you doing with my cook?--lost yours and trying to shanghai him?\" Hall \\nwas saying. \"You\\'d better let him go, if you\\'re going to have any supper. My wife\\'s \\nhere, and she\\'ll be glad to meet you--dinner, she calls it, and calls me down for \\nmisnaming it, but I\\'m old fashioned. My folks always ate dinner in the middle of \\nthe day. Can\\'t get over early training. Don\\'t you want to wash up? I do. Look at \\nme. I\\'ve been working like a dog--out with the diving crew--shell, you know. But \\nof course you smelt it.\" \\n \\nV \\n \\nSnow pleaded charge of the schooner, and went on board. In addition to his \\nrepugnance at breaking salt with the man who had robbed him, it was necessary \\nfor him to impress the in-violableness of Grief\\'s lies on the Kanaka crew. By \\neleven o\\'clock Grief came on board, to find his mate waiting up for him. \\n \\n\"There\\'s something doing on Swithin Hall\\'s island,\" Grief said, shaking his head. \\n\"I can\\'t make out what it is, but I get the feel of it. What does Swithin Hall look \\nlike?\" \\n \\nSnow shook his head. \\n \\n\"That man ashore there never bought the books on the shelves,\" Grief declared \\nwith conviction. \"Nor did he ever go in for concealed lighting. He\\'s got a surface \\nflow of suavity, but he\\'s rough as a hoof-rasp underneath. He\\'s an oily bluff. And \\nthe bunch he\\'s got with him--Watson and Gorman their names are; they came in \\nafter you left--real sea-dogs, middle-aged, marred and battered, tough as rusty \\nwrought-iron nails and twice as dangerous; real ugly customers, with guns in \\ntheir belts, who don\\'t strike me as just the right sort to be on such comradely \\nterms with Swithin Hall. And the woman! She\\'s a lady. I mean it. She knows a \\nwhole lot of South America, and of China, too. I\\'m sure she\\'s Spanish, though her \\nEnglish is natural. She\\'s travelled. We talked bull-fights. She\\'s seen them in \\nGuayaquil, in Mexico, in Seville. She knows a lot about sealskins. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n85 \\n\"Now here\\'s what bothers me. She knows music. I asked her if she played. And \\nhe\\'s fixed that place up like a palace. That being so, why hasn\\'t he a piano for \\nher? Another thing: she\\'s quick and lively and he watches her whenever she \\ntalks. He\\'s on pins and needles, and continually breaking in and leading the \\nconversation. Say, did you ever hear that Swithin Hall was married?\" \\n \\n\"Bless me, I don\\'t know,\" the mate replied. \"Never entered my head to think about \\nit.\" \\n \\n\"He introduced her as Mrs. Hall. And Watson and Gorman call him Hall. They\\'re a \\nprecious pair, those two men. I don\\'t understand it at all.\" \\n \\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" Snow asked. \\n \\n\"Oh, hang around a while. There are some books ashore there I want to read. \\nSuppose you send that topmast down in the morning and generally overhaul. \\nWe\\'ve been through a hurricane, you know. Set up the rigging while you\\'re about \\nit. Get things pretty well adrift, and take your time.\" \\n \\n VI \\n \\nThe next day Grief\\'s suspicions found further food. Ashore early, he strolled \\nacross the little island to the barracks occupied by the divers. \\n \\nThey were just boarding the boats when he arrived, and it struck him that for \\nKanakas they behaved more like chain-gang prisoners. The three white men were \\nthere, and Grief noted that each carried a rifle. Hall greeted him jovially enough, \\nbut Gorman and Watson scowled as they grunted curt good mornings. \\n \\nA moment afterward one of the Kanakas, as he bent to place his oar, favoured \\nGrief with a slow, deliberate wink. The man\\'s face was familiar, one of the \\nthousands of native sailors and divers he had encountered drifting about in the \\nisland trade. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t tell them who I am,\" Grief said, in Tahitian. \"Did you ever sail for me?\" \\n \\nThe man\\'s head nodded and his mouth opened, but before he could speak he was \\nsuppressed by a savage \"Shut up!\" from Watson, who was already in the \\nsternsheets. \\n \\n\"I beg pardon,\" Grief said. \"I ought to have known better.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s all right,\" Hall interposed. \"The trouble is they\\'re too much talk and not \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n86 \\nenough work. Have to be severe with them, or they wouldn\\'t get enough shell to \\npay their grub.\" \\n \\nGrief nodded sympathetically. \"I know them. Got a crew of them myself--the lazy \\nswine. Got to drive them like niggers to get a half-day\\'s work out of them.\" \\n \\n\"What was you sayin\\' to him?\" Gorman blurted in bluntly. \\n \\n\"I was asking how the shell was, and how deep they were diving.\" \\n \\n\"Thick,\" Hall took over the answering. \"We\\'re working now in about ten fathom. \\nIt\\'s right out there, not a hundred yards off. Want to come along?\" \\n \\nHalf the day Grief spent with the boats, and had lunch in the bungalow. In the \\nafternoon he loafed, taking a siesta in the big living-room, reading some, and \\ntalking for half an hour with Mrs. Hall. After dinner, he played billiards with her \\nhusband. It chanced that Grief had never before encountered Swithin Hall, yet \\nthe latter\\'s fame as an expert at billiards was the talk of the beaches from Levuka \\nto Honolulu. But the man Grief played with this night proved most indifferent at \\nthe game. His wife showed herself far cleverer with the cue. \\n \\nWhen he went on board the Uncle Toby Grief routed Jackie-Jackie out of bed. He \\ndescribed the location of the barracks, and told the Tongan to swim softly around \\nand have talk with the Kanakas. In two hours Jackie-Jackie was back. He shook \\nhis head as he stood dripping before Grief. \\n \\n\"Very funny t\\'ing,\" he reported. \"One white man stop all the time. He has big rifle. \\nHe lay in water and watch. Maybe twelve o\\'clock, other white man come and take \\nrifle. First white man go to bed. Other man stop now with rifle. No good. Me \\ncannot talk with Kanakas. Me come back.\" \\n \\n\"By George!\" Grief said to Snow, after the Tongan had gone back to his bunk. \"I \\nsmell something more than shell. Those three men are standing watches over \\ntheir Kanakas. That man\\'s no more Swithin Hall than I am.\" \\n \\nSnow whistled from the impact of a new idea. \\n \\n\"I\\'ve got it!\" he cried. \\n \\n\"And I\\'ll name it,\" Grief retorted, \"It\\'s in your mind that the Emily L. was their \\nschooner?\" \\n \\n\"Just that. They\\'re raising and rotting the shell, while she\\'s gone for more divers, \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n87 \\nor provisions, or both.\" \\n \\n\"And I agree with you.\" Grief glanced at the cabin clock and evinced signs of bed-\\ngoing. \"He\\'s a sailor. The three of them are. But they\\'re not island men. They\\'re \\nnew in these waters.\" \\n \\nAgain Snow whistled. \\n \\n\"And the Emily L. is lost with all hands,\" he said. \"We know that. They\\'re \\nmarooned here till Swithin Hall comes. Then he\\'ll catch them with all the shell.\" \\n \\n\"Or they\\'ll take possession of his schooner.\" \\n \\n\"Hope they do!\" Snow muttered vindictively. \"Somebody ought to rob him. Wish I \\nwas in their boots. I\\'d balance off that sixty thousand.\" \\n \\nVII \\n \\nA week passed, during which time the Uncle Toby was ready for sea, while Grief \\nmanaged to allay any suspicion of him by the shore crowd. \\n \\nEven Gorman and Watson accepted him at his self-description. Throughout the \\nweek Grief begged and badgered them for the longitude of the island. \\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t have me leave here lost,\" he finally urged. \"I can\\'t get a line on my \\nchronometer without your longitude.\" \\n \\nHall laughingly refused. \\n \\n\"You\\'re too good a navigator, Mr. Anstey, not to fetch New Guinea or some other \\nhigh land.\" \\n \\n\"And you\\'re too good a navigator, Mr. Hall,\" Grief replied, \"not to know that I can \\nfetch your island any time by running down its latitude.\" \\n \\nOn the last evening, ashore, as usual, to dinner, Grief got his first view of the \\npearls they had collected. Mrs. Hall, waxing enthusiastic, had asked her husband \\nto bring forth the \"pretties,\" and had spent half an hour showing them to Grief. \\nHis delight in them was genuine, as well as was his surprise that they had made \\nso rich a haul. \\n \\n\"The lagoon is virgin,\" Hall explained. \"You saw yourself that most of the shell is \\nlarge and old. But it\\'s funny that we got most of the valuable pearls in one small \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n88 \\npatch in the course of a week. It was a little treasure house. Every oyster seemed \\nfilled--seed pearls by the quart, of course, but the perfect ones, most of that \\nbunch there, came out of the small patch.\" \\n \\nGrief ran his eye over them and knew their value ranged from one hundred to a \\nthousand dollars each, while the several selected large ones went far beyond. \\n \\n\"Oh, the pretties! the pretties!\" Mrs. Hall cried, bending forward suddenly and \\nkissing them. \\n \\nA few minutes later she arose to say good-night. \\n \\n\"It\\'s good-bye,\" Grief said, as he took her hand. \"We sail at daylight.\" \\n \\n\"So suddenly!\" she cried, while Grief could not help seeing the quick light of \\nsatisfaction in her husband\\'s eyes. \\n \\n\"Yes,\" Grief continued. \"All the repairs are finished. I can\\'t get the longitude of \\nyour island out of your husband, though I\\'m still in hopes he\\'ll relent.\" \\n \\nHall laughed and shook his head, and, as his wife left the room, proposed a last \\nfarewell nightcap. They sat over it, smoking and talking. \\n \\n\"What do you estimate they\\'re worth?\" Grief asked, indicating the spread of pearls \\non the table. \"I mean what the pearl-buyers would give you in open market?\" \\n \\n\"Oh, seventy-five or eighty thousand,\" Hall said carelessly. \\n \\n\"I\\'m afraid you\\'re underestimating. I know pearls a bit. Take that biggest one. It\\'s \\nperfect. Not a cent less than five thousand dollars. Some multimillionaire will pay \\ndouble that some day, when the dealers have taken their whack. And never \\nminding the seed pearls, you\\'ve got quarts of baroques there. And baroques are \\ncoming into fashion. They\\'re picking up and doubling on themselves every year.\" \\n \\nHall gave the trove of pearls a closer and longer scrutiny, estimating the different \\nparcels and adding the sum aloud. \\n \\n\"You\\'re right,\" he admitted. \"They\\'re worth a hundred thousand right now.\" \\n \\n\"And at what do you figure your working expenses?\" Grief went on. \"Your time, \\nand your two men\\'s, and the divers\\'?\" \\n \\n\"Five thousand would cover it.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n89 \\n \\n\"Then they stand to net you ninety-five thousand?\" \\n \\n\"Something like that. But why so curious?\" \\n \\n\"Why, I was just trying----\" Grief paused and drained his glass. \"Just trying to \\nreach some sort of an equitable arrangement. Suppose I should give you and your \\npeople a passage to Sydney and the five thousand dollars--or, better, seven \\nthousand five hundred. You\\'ve worked hard.\" \\n \\nWithout commotion or muscular movement the other man became alert and \\ntense. His round-faced geniality went out like the flame of a snuffed candle. No \\nlaughter clouded the surface of the eyes, and in their depths showed the hard, \\ndangerous soul of the man. He spoke in a low, deliberate voice. \\n \\n\"Now just what in hell do you mean by that?\" \\n \\nGrief casually relighted his cigar. \\n \\n\"I don\\'t know just how to begin,\" he said. \"The situation is--er--is embarrassing \\nfor you. You see, I\\'m trying to be fair. As I say, you\\'ve worked hard. I don\\'t want to \\nconfiscate the pearls. I want to pay you for your time and trouble, and expense.\" \\n \\nConviction, instantaneous and absolute, froze on the other\\'s face. \\n \\n\"And I thought you were in Europe,\" he muttered. Hope flickered for a moment. \\n\"Look here, you\\'re joking me. How do I know you\\'re Swithin Hall?\" \\n \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders. \"Such a joke would be in poor taste, after your \\nhospitality. And it is equally in poor taste to have two Swithin Halls on the \\nisland.\" \\n \\n\"Since you\\'re Swithin Hall, then who the deuce am I? Do you know that, too?\" \\n \\n\"No,\" Grief answered airily. \"But I\\'d like to know.\" \\n \\n\"Well, it\\'s none of your business.\" \\n \\n\"I grant it. Your identity is beside the point. Besides, I know your schooner, and I \\ncan find out who you are from that.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s her name?\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n90 \\n\"The Emily L. \\n \\n\"Correct. I\\'m Captain Raffy, owner and master.\" \\n \\n\"The seal-poacher? I\\'ve heard of you. What under the sun brought you down here \\non my preserves?\" \\n \\n\"Needed the money. The seal herds are about finished.\" \\n \\n\"And the out-of-the-way places of the world are better policed, eh?\" \\n \\n\"Pretty close to it. And now about this present scrape, Mr. Hall. I can put up a \\nnasty fight. What are you going to do about it?\" \\n \\n\"What I said. Even better. What\\'s the Emily L. worth?\" \\n \\n\"She\\'s seen her day. Not above ten thousand, which would be robbery. Every time \\nshe\\'s in a rough sea I\\'m afraid she\\'ll jump her ballast through her planking.\" \\n \\n\"She has jumped it, Captain Raffy. I sighted her bottom-up after the blow. \\nSuppose we say she was worth seven thousand five hundred. I\\'ll pay over to you \\nfifteen thousand and give you a passage. Don\\'t move your hands from your lap.\" \\nGrief stood up, went over to him, and took his revolver. \"Just a necessary \\nprecaution, Captain. Now you\\'ll go on board with me. I\\'ll break the news to Mrs. \\nRaffy afterward, and fetch her out to join you.\" \\n \\n\"You\\'re behaving handsomely, Mr. Hall, I must say,\" Captain Raffy volunteered, \\nas the whaleboat came alongside the Uncle Toby. \"But watch out for Gorman and \\nWatson. They\\'re ugly customers. And, by the way, I don\\'t like to mention it, but \\nyou\\'ve seen my wife. I\\'ve given her four or five pearls. Watson and Gorman were \\nwilling.\" \\n \\n\"Say no more, Captain. Say no more. They shall remain hers. Is that you, Mr. \\nSnow? Here\\'s a friend I want you to take charge of--Captain Raffy. I\\'m going \\nashore for his wife.\" \\n \\nVIII \\n \\nDavid Grief sat writing at the library table in the bungalow living-room. Outside, \\nthe first pale of dawn was showing. He had had a busy night. Mrs. Raffy had \\ntaken two hysterical hours to pack her and Captain Raffy\\'s possessions. Gorman \\nhad been caught asleep, but Watson, standing guard over the divers, had shown \\nfight. Matters did not reach the shooting stage, but it was only after it had been \\n', \"www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n91 \\ndemonstrated to him that the game was up that he consented to join his \\ncompanions on board. For temporary convenience, he and Gorman were shackled \\nin the mate's room, Mrs. Raffy was confined in Grief's, and Captain Raffy made \\nfast to the cabin table. \\n \\nGrief finished the document and read over what he had written: \\n \\n  To   Swithin   Hall,   for   pearls   taken from his lagoon (estimated)              \\n \\n100,000 \\n \\n  To Herbert Snow, paid in full for salvage from   steamship Cascade in pearls \\n(estimated)              \\n \\n60,000 \\n \\n  To Captain Raffy, salary and expenses for   collecting pearls                                     \\n7,500 \\n \\n  To  Captain  Raffy,  reimbursement for   schooner  Emily  L.,  lost  in hurricane              \\n7,500 \\n \\n  To Mrs. Raffy, for good will, five fair   pearls (estimated)                                    \\n1,100 \\n \\n  To passage to Syndey, four persons,   at  \\n \\n120.                                                480 \\n \\n  To  white  lead for painting  Swithin   Hall's two whaleboats                                     \\n9 \\n \\n  To  Swithin Hall,  balance  in pearls (estimated)   which are to be found in \\ndrawer of library table     23,411 \\n \\n                                                      \\n \\n100,000-- \\n \\n100,000 \\n \\nGrief signed and dated, paused, and added at the bottom: \\n \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n92 \\n     P. S.--Still owing to Swithin Hall three books, borrowed      from library: \\nHudson\\'s \"Law of Psychic Phenomena,\" Zola\\'s      \"Paris,\" and Mahan\\'s \"Problem \\nof Asia.\" These books, or full      value, can be collected of said David Griefs \\nSydney office. \\n \\nHe shut off the electric light, picked up the bundle of books, carefully latched the \\nfront door, and went down to the waiting whaleboat. \\n', \"www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n93 \\n \\nChapter Six--A GOBOTO NIGHT \\n \\n I \\n \\nAt Goboto the traders come off their schooners and the planters drift in from far, \\nwild coasts, and one and all they assume shoes, white duck trousers, and various \\nother appearances of civilization. At Goboto mail is received, bills are paid, and \\nnewspapers, rarely more than five weeks old, are accessible; for the little island, \\nbelted with its coral reefs, affords safe anchorage, is the steamer port of call, and \\nserves as the distributing point for the whole wide-scattered group. \\n \\nLife at Goboto is heated, unhealthy, and lurid, and for its size it asserts the \\ndistinction of more cases of acute alcoholism than any other spot in the world. \\nGuvutu, over in the Solomons, claims that it drinks between drinks. Goboto does \\nnot deny this. It merely states, in passing, that in the Goboton chronology no \\nsuch interval of time is known. It also points out its import statistics, which show \\na far larger per capita consumption of spiritous liquors. Guvutu explains this on \\nthe basis that Goboto does a larger business and has more visitors. Goboto \\nretorts that its resident population is smaller and that its visitors are thirstier. \\nAnd the discussion goes on interminably, principally because of the fact that the \\ndisputants do not live long enough to settle it. \\n \\nGoboto is not large. The island is only a quarter of a mile in diameter, and on it \\nare situated an admiralty coal-shed (where a few tons of coal have lain untouched \\nfor twenty years), the barracks for a handful of black labourers, a big store and \\nwarehouse with sheet-iron roofs, and a bungalow inhabited by the manager and \\nhis two clerks. They are the white population. An average of one man out of the \\nthree is always to be found down with fever. The job at Goboto is a hard one. It is \\nthe policy of the company to treat its patrons well, as invading companies have \\nfound out, and it is the task of the manager and clerks to do the treating. \\nThroughout the year traders and recruiters arrive from far, dry cruises, and \\nplanters from equally distant and dry shores, bringing with them magnificent \\nthirsts. Goboto is the mecca of sprees, and when they have spread they go back \\nto their schooners and plantations to recuperate. \\n \\nSome of the less hardy require as much as six months between visits. But for the \\nmanager and his assistants there are no such intervals. They are on the spot, and \\nweek by week, blown in by monsoon or southeast trade, the schooners come to \\nanchor, cargo'd with copra, ivory nuts, pearl-shell, hawksbill turtle, and thirst. \\n \\nIt is a very hard job at Goboto. That is why the pay is twice that on other stations, \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n94 \\nand that is why the company selects only courageous and intrepid men for this \\nparticular station. They last no more than a year or so, when the wreckage of \\nthem is shipped back to Australia, or the remains of them are buried in the sand \\nacross on the windward side of the islet. Johnny Bassett, almost the legendary \\nhero of Goboto, broke all records. He was a remittance man with a remarkable \\nconstitution, and he lasted seven years. His dying request was duly observed by \\nhis clerks, who pickled him in a cask of trade-rum (paid for out of their own \\nsalaries) and shipped him back to his people in England. Nevertheless, at Goboto, \\nthey tried to be gentlemen. For that matter, though something was wrong with \\nthem, they were gentlemen, and had been gentlemen. That was why the great \\nunwritten rule of Goboto was that visitors should put on pants and shoes. \\nBreech-clouts, lava-lavas, and bare legs were not tolerated. When Captain \\nJensen, the wildest of the Blackbirders though descended from old New York \\nKnickerbocker stock, surged in, clad in loin-cloth, undershirt, two belted \\nrevolvers and a sheath-knife, he was stopped at the beach. This was in the days \\nof Johnny Bassett, ever a stickler in matters of etiquette. Captain Jensen stood \\nup in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and denied the existence of pants on his \\nschooner. Also, he affirmed his intention of coming ashore. They of Goboto \\nnursed him back to health from a bullet-hole through his shoulder, and in \\naddition handsomely begged his pardon, for no pants had they found on his \\nschooner. And finally, on the first day he sat up, Johnny Bassett kindly but firmly \\nassisted his guest into a pair of pants of his own. This was the great precedent. In \\nall the succeeding years it had never been violated. White men and pants were \\nundivorce-able. Only niggers ran naked. Pants constituted caste. \\n \\nII \\n \\nOn this night things were, with one exception, in nowise different from any other \\nnight. Seven of them, with glimmering eyes and steady legs, had capped a day of \\nScotch with swivel-sticked cocktails and sat down to dinner. Jacketed, trousered, \\nand shod, they were: Jerry McMurtrey, the manager; Eddy Little and Jack \\nAndrews, clerks; Captain Stapler, of the recruiting ketch Merry; Darby Shryleton, \\nplanter from Tito-Ito; Peter Gee, a half-caste Chinese pearl-buyer who ranged \\nfrom Ceylon to the Paumotus, and Alfred Deacon, a visitor who had stopped off \\nfrom the last steamer. At first wine was served by the black servants to those that \\ndrank it, though all quickly shifted back to Scotch and soda, pickling their food \\nas they ate it, ere it went into their calcined, pickled stomachs. \\n \\nOver their coffee, they heard the rumble of an anchor-chain through a hawse-\\npipe, tokening the arrival of a vessel. \\n \\n\"It\\'s David Grief,\" Peter Gee remarked. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n95 \\n\"How do you know?\" Deacon demanded truculently, and then went on to deny the \\nhalf-caste\\'s knowledge. \"You chaps put on a lot of side over a new chum. I\\'ve done \\nsome sailing myself, and this naming a craft when its sail is only a blur, or \\nnaming a man by the sound of his anchor--it\\'s--it\\'s unadulterated poppycock.\" \\n \\nPeter Gee was engaged in lighting a cigarette, and did not answer. \\n \\n\"Some of the niggers do amazing things that way,\" McMurtrey interposed \\ntactfully. \\n \\nAs with the others, this conduct of their visitor jarred on the manager. From the \\nmoment of Peter Gee\\'s arrival that afternoon Deacon had manifested a tendency \\nto pick on him. He had disputed his statements and been generally rude. \\n \\n\"Maybe it\\'s because Peter\\'s got Chink blood in him,\" had been Andrews\\' \\nhypothesis. \"Deacon\\'s Australian, you know, and they\\'re daffy down there on \\ncolour.\" \\n \\n\"I fancy that\\'s it,\" McMurtrey had agreed. \"But we can\\'t permit any bullying, \\nespecially of a man like Peter Gee, who\\'s whiter than most white men.\" \\n \\nIn this the manager had been in nowise wrong. Peter Gee was that rare creature, \\na good as well as clever Eurasian. In fact, it was the stolid integrity of the Chinese \\nblood that toned the recklessness and licentiousness of the English blood which \\nhad run in his father\\'s veins. Also, he was better educated than any man there, \\nspoke better English as well as several other tongues, and knew and lived more of \\ntheir own ideals of gentlemanness than they did themselves. And, finally, he was \\na gentle soul. Violence he deprecated, though he had killed men in his time. \\nTurbulence he abhorred. \\n \\nHe always avoided it as he would the plague. \\n \\nCaptain Stapler stepped in to help McMurtrey: \\n \\n\"I remember, when I changed schooners and came into Altman, the niggers knew \\nright off the bat it was me. I wasn\\'t expected, either, much less to be in another \\ncraft. They told the trader it was me. He used the glasses, and wouldn\\'t believe \\nthem. But they did know. Told me afterward they could see it sticking out all over \\nthe schooner that I was running her.\" \\n \\nDeacon ignored him, and returned to the attack on the pearl-buyer. \\n \\n\"How do you know from the sound of the anchor that it was this whatever-you-\\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n96 \\ncalled-him man?\" he challenged. \\n \\n\"There are so many things that go to make up such a judgment,\" Peter Gee \\nanswered. \"It\\'s very hard to explain. It would require almost a text book.\" \\n \\n\"I thought so,\" Deacon sneered. \"Explanation that doesn\\'t explain is easy.\" \\n \\n\"Who\\'s for bridge?\" Eddy Little, the second clerk, interrupted, looking up \\nexpectantly and starting to shuffle. \"You\\'ll play, won\\'t you, Peter?\" \\n \\n\"If he does, he\\'s a bluffer,\" Deacon cut back. \"I\\'m getting tired of all this \\npoppycock. Mr. Gee, you will favour me and put yourself in a better light if you \\ntell how you know who that man was that just dropped anchor. After that I\\'ll play \\nyou piquet.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'d prefer bridge,\" Peter answered. \"As for the other thing, it\\'s something like this: \\nBy the sound it was a small craft--no square-rigger. No whistle, no siren, was \\nblown--again a small craft. It anchored close in--still again a small craft, for \\nsteamers and big ships must drop hook outside the middle shoal. Now the \\nentrance is tortuous. There is no recruiting nor trading captain in the group who \\ndares to run the passage after dark. Certainly no stranger would. There were two \\nexceptions. The first was Margonville. But he was executed by the High Court at \\nFiji. Remains the other exception, David Grief. Night or day, in any weather, he \\nruns the passage. This is well known to all. A possible factor, in case Grief were \\nsomewhere else, would be some young dare-devil of a skipper. In this connection, \\nin the first place, I don\\'t know of any, nor does anybody else. In the second place, \\nDavid Grief is in these waters, cruising on the Gunga, which is shortly scheduled \\nto leave here for Karo-Karo. I spoke to Grief, on the Gunga, in Sandfly Passage, \\nday before yesterday. He was putting a trader ashore on a new station. He said he \\nwas going to call in at Babo, and then come on to Goboto. He has had ample time \\nto get here. I have heard an anchor drop. Who else than David Grief can it be? \\nCaptain Donovan is skipper of the Gunga, and him I know too well to believe that \\nhe\\'d run in to Goboto after dark unless his owner were in charge. In a few \\nminutes David Grief will enter through that door and say, \\'In Guvutu they merely \\ndrink between drinks.\\' I\\'ll wager fifty pounds he\\'s the man that enters and that \\nhis words will be, \\'In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks. \\'\" Deacon was for \\nthe moment crushed. The sullen blood rose darkly in his face. \\n \\n\"Well, he\\'s answered you,\" McMurtrey laughed genially. \"And I\\'ll back his bet \\nmyself for a couple of sovereigns.\" \\n \\n\"Bridge! Who\\'s going to take a hand?\" Eddy Little cried impatiently. \"Come on, \\nPeter!\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n97 \\n \\n\"The rest of you play,\" Deacon said. \"He and I are going to play piquet.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'d prefer bridge,\" Peter Gee said mildly. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t you play piquet?\" \\n \\nThe pearl-buyer nodded. \\n \\n\"Then come on. Maybe I can show I know more about that than I do about \\nanchors.\" \\n \\n\"Oh, I say----\" McMurtrey began. \\n \\n\"You can play bridge,\" Deacon shut him off. \"We prefer piquet.\" \\n \\nReluctantly, Peter Gee was bullied into a game that he knew would be unhappy. \\n \\n\"Only a rubber,\" he said, as he cut for deal. \\n \\n\"For how much?\" Deacon asked. \\n \\nPeter Gee shrugged his shoulders. \"As you please.\" \\n \\n\"Hundred up--five pounds a game?\" \\n \\nPeter Gee agreed. \\n \\n\"With the lurch double, of course, ten pounds?\" \\n \\n\"All right,\" said Peter Gee. \\n \\nAt another table four of the others sat in at bridge. Captain Stapler, who was no \\ncard-player, looked on and replenished the long glasses of Scotch that stood at \\neach man\\'s right hand. McMurtrey, with poorly concealed apprehension, followed \\nas well as he could what went on at the piquet table. His fellow Englishmen as \\nwell were shocked by the behaviour of the Australian, and all were troubled by \\nfear of some untoward act on his part. That he was working up his animosity \\nagainst the half-caste, and that the explosion might come any time, was apparent \\nto all. \\n \\n\"I hope Peter loses,\" McMurtrey said in an undertone. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n98 \\n\"Not if he has any luck,\" Andrews answered. \"He\\'s a wizard at piquet. I know by \\nexperience.\" \\n \\nThat Peter Gee was lucky was patent from the continual badgering of Deacon, \\nwho filled his glass frequently. He had lost the first game, and, from his remarks, \\nwas losing the second, when the door opened and David Grief entered. \\n \\n\"In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks,\" he remarked casually to the \\nassembled company, ere he gripped the manager\\'s hand. \"Hello, Mac! Say, my \\nskipper\\'s down in the whaleboat. He\\'s got a silk shirt, a tie, and tennis shoes, all \\ncomplete, but he wants you to send a pair of pants down. Mine are too small, but \\nyours will fit him. Hello, Eddy! How\\'s that ngari-ngari? You up, Jock? The miracle \\nhas happened. No one down with fever, and no one remarkably drunk.\" He \\nsighed, \"I suppose the night is young yet. Hello, Peter! Did you catch that big \\nsquall an hour after you left us? We had to let go the second anchor.\" \\n \\nWhile he was being introduced to Deacon, McMurtrey dispatched a house-boy \\nwith the pants, and when Captain Donovan came in it was as a white man \\nshould--at least in Goboto. \\n \\nDeacon lost the second game, and an outburst heralded the fact. Peter Gee \\ndevoted himself to lighting a cigarette and keeping quiet. \\n \\n\"What?--are you quitting because you\\'re ahead?\" Deacon demanded. \\n \\nGrief raised his eyebrows questioningly to McMurtrey, who frowned back his own \\ndisgust. \\n \\n\"It\\'s the rubber,\" Peter Gee answered. \\n \\n\"It takes three games to make a rubber. It\\'s my deal. Come on!\" \\n \\nPeter Gee acquiesced, and the third game was on. \\n \\n\"Young whelp--he needs a lacing,\" McMurtrey muttered to Grief. \"Come on, let us \\nquit, you chaps. I want to keep an eye on him. If he goes too far I\\'ll throw him out \\non the beach, company instructions or no.\" \\n \\n\"Who is he?\" Grief queried. \\n \\n\"A left-over from last steamer. Company\\'s orders to treat him nice. He\\'s looking to \\ninvest in a plantation. Has a ten-thousand-pound letter of credit with the \\ncompany. He\\'s got \\'all-white Australia\\' on the brain. Thinks because his skin is \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n99 \\nwhite and because his father was once Attorney-General of the Commonwealth \\nthat he can be a cur. That\\'s why he\\'s picking on Peter, and you know Peter\\'s the \\nlast man in the world to make trouble or incur trouble. Damn the company. I \\ndidn\\'t engage to wet-nurse its infants with bank accounts. Come on, fill your \\nglass, Grief. The man\\'s a blighter, a blithering blighter.\" \\n \\n\"Maybe he\\'s only young,\" Grief suggested. \\n \\n\"He can\\'t contain his drink--that\\'s clear.\" The manager glared his disgust and \\nwrath. \"If he raises a hand to Peter, so help me, I\\'ll give him a licking myself, the \\nlittle overgrown cad!\" \\n \\nThe pearl-buyer pulled the pegs out of the cribbage board on which he was \\nscoring and sat back. He had won the third game. He glanced across to Eddy \\nLittle, saying: \\n \\n\"I\\'m ready for the bridge, now.\" \\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t be a quitter,\" Deacon snarled. \\n \\n\"Oh, really, I\\'m tired of the game,\" Peter Gee assured him with his habitual \\nquietness. \\n \\n\"Come on and be game,\" Deacon bullied. \"One more. You can\\'t take my money \\nthat way. I\\'m out fifteen pounds. Double or quits.\" \\n \\nMcMurtrey was about to interpose, but Grief restrained him with his eyes. \\n \\n\"If it positively is the last, all right,\" said Peter Gee, gathering up the cards. \"It\\'s \\nmy deal, I believe. As I understand it, this final is for fifteen pounds. Either you \\nowe me thirty or we quit even?\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s it, chappie. Either we break even or I pay you thirty.\" \\n \\n\"Getting blooded, eh?\" Grief remarked, drawing up a chair. \\n \\nThe other men stood or sat around the table, and Deacon played again in bad \\nluck. That he was a good player was clear. The cards were merely running against \\nhim. That he could not take his ill luck with equanimity was equally clear. He \\nwas guilty of sharp, ugly curses, and he snapped and growled at the \\nimperturbable half-caste. In the end Peter Gee counted out, while Deacon had not \\neven made his fifty points. He glowered speechlessly at his opponent. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n100 \\n\"Looks like a lurch,\" said Grief. \\n \\n\"Which is double,\" said Peter Gee. \\n \\n\"There\\'s no need your telling me,\" Deacon snarled. \"I\\'ve studied arithmetic. I owe \\nyou forty-five pounds. There, take it!\" \\n \\nThe way in which he flung the nine five-pound notes on the table was an insult in \\nitself. Peter Gee was even quieter, and flew no signals of resentment. \\n \\n\"You\\'ve got fool\\'s luck, but you can\\'t play cards, I can tell you that much,\" Deacon \\nwent on. \"I could teach you cards.\" \\n \\nThe half-caste smiled and nodded acquiescence as he folded up the money. \\n \\n\"There\\'s a little game called casino--I wonder if you ever heard of it?--a child\\'s \\ngame.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ve seen it played,\" the half-caste murmured gently. \\n \\n\"What\\'s that?\" snapped Deacon. \"Maybe you think you can play it?\" \\n \\n\"Oh, no, not for a moment. I\\'m afraid I haven\\'t head enough for it.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s a bully game, casino,\" Grief broke in pleasantly. \"I like it very much.\" \\n \\nDeacon ignored him. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll play you ten quid a game--thirty-one points out,\" was the challenge to Peter \\nGee. \"And I\\'ll show you how little you know about cards. Come on! Where\\'s a full \\ndeck?\" \\n \\n\"No, thanks,\" the half-caste answered. \"They are waiting for me in order to make \\nup a bridge set.\" \\n \\n\"Yes, come on,\" Eddy Little begged eagerly. \"Come on, Peter, let\\'s get started.\" \\n \\n\"Afraid of a little game like casino,\" Deacon girded. \"Maybe the stakes are too \\nhigh. I\\'ll play you for pennies--or farthings, if you say so.\" \\n \\nThe man\\'s conduct was a hurt and an affront to all of them. McMurtrey could \\nstand it no longer. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n101 \\n\"Now hold on, Deacon. He says he doesn\\'t want to play. Let him alone.\" \\n \\nDeacon turned raging upon his host; but before he could blurt out his abuse, \\nGrief had stepped into the breach. \\n \\n\"I\\'d like to play casino with you,\" he said. \\n \\n\"What do you know about it?\" \\n \\n\"Not much, but I\\'m willing to learn.\" \\n \\n\"Well, I\\'m not teaching for pennies to-night.\" \\n \\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" Grief answered. \"I\\'ll play for almost any sum--within reason, \\nof course.\" \\n \\nDeacon proceeded to dispose of this intruder with one stroke. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll play you a hundred pounds a game, if that will do you any good.\" \\n \\nGrief beamed his delight. \"That will be all right, very right. Let us begin. Do you \\ncount sweeps?\" \\n \\nDeacon was taken aback. He had not expected a Goboton trader to be anything \\nbut crushed by such a proposition. \\n \\n\"Do you count sweeps?\" Grief repeated. \\n \\nAndrews had brought him a new deck, and he was throwing out the joker. \\n \\n\"Certainly not,\" Deacon answered. \"That\\'s a sissy game.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'m glad,\" Grief coincided. \"I don\\'t like sissy games either.\" \\n \\n\"You don\\'t, eh? Well, then, I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do. We\\'ll play for five hundred \\npounds a game.\" \\n \\nAgain Deacon was taken aback. \\n \\n\"I\\'m agreeable,\" Grief said, beginning to shuffle. \"Cards and spades go out first, of \\ncourse, and then big and little casino, and the aces in the bridge order of value. Is \\nthat right?\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n102 \\n\"You\\'re a lot of jokers down here,\" Deacon laughed, but his laughter was strained. \\n\"How do I know you\\'ve got the money?\" \\n \\n\"By the same token I know you\\'ve got it. Mac, how\\'s my credit with the company?\" \\n \\n\"For all you want,\" the manager answered. \\n \\n\"You personally guarantee that?\" Deacon demanded. \\n \\n\"I certainly do,\" McMurtrey said. \"Depend upon it, the company will honour his \\npaper up and past your letter of credit.\" \\n \\n\"Low deals,\" Grief said, placing the deck before Deacon on the table. \\n \\nThe latter hesitated in the midst of the cut and looked around with querulous \\nmisgiving at the faces of the others. The clerks and captains nodded. \\n \\n\"You\\'re all strangers to me,\" Deacon complained. \"How am I to know? Money on \\npaper isn\\'t always the real thing.\" \\n \\nThen it was that Peter Gee, drawing a wallet from his pocket and borrowing a \\nfountain pen from McMurtrey, went into action. \\n \\n\"I haven\\'t gone to buying yet,\" the half-caste explained, \"so the account is intact. \\nI\\'ll just indorse it over to you, Grief. It\\'s for fifteen thousand. There, look at it.\" \\n \\nDeacon intercepted the letter of credit as it was being passed across the table. He \\nread it slowly, then glanced up at McMurtrey. \\n \\n\"Is that right?\" \\n \\n\"Yes. It\\'s just the same as your own, and just as good. The company\\'s paper is \\nalways good.\" \\n \\nDeacon cut the cards, won the deal, and gave them a thorough shuffle. But his \\nluck was still against him, and he lost the game. \\n \\n\"Another game,\" he said. \"We didn\\'t say how many, and you can\\'t quit with me a \\nloser. I want action.\" \\n \\nGrief shuffled and passed the cards for the cut. \\n \\n\"Let\\'s play for a thousand,\" Deacon said, when he had lost the second game. And \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n103 \\nwhen the thousand had gone the way of the two five hundred bets he proposed to \\nplay for two thousand. \\n \\n\"That\\'s progression,\" McMurtrey warned, and was rewarded by a glare from \\nDeacon. But the manager was insistent. \"You don\\'t have to play progression, \\nGrief, unless you\\'re foolish.\" \\n \\n\"Who\\'s playing this game?\" Deacon flamed at his host; and then, to Grief: \"I\\'ve \\nlost two thousand to you. Will you play for two thousand?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded, the fourth game began, and Deacon won. The manifest unfairness \\nof such betting was known to all of them. Though he had lost three games out of \\nfour, Deacon had lost no money. By the child\\'s device of doubling his wager with \\neach loss, he was bound, with the first game he won, no matter how long delayed, \\nto be even again. \\n \\nHe now evinced an unspoken desire to stop, but Grief passed the deck to be cut. \\n \\n\"What?\" Deacon cried. \"You want more?\" \\n \\n\"Haven\\'t got anything yet,\" Grief murmured whimsically, as he began the deal. \\n\"For the usual five hundred, I suppose?\" \\n \\nThe shame of what he had done must have tingled in Deacon, for he answered, \\n\"No, we\\'ll play for a thousand. And say! Thirty-one points is too long. Why not \\ntwenty-one points out--if it isn\\'t too rapid for you?\" \\n \\n\"That will make it a nice, quick, little game,\" Grief agreed. \\n \\nThe former method of play was repeated. Deacon lost two games, doubled the \\nstake, and was again even. But Grief was patient, though the thing occurred \\nseveral times in the next hour\\'s play. Then happened what he was waiting for--a \\nlengthening in the series of losing games for Deacon. The latter doubled to four \\nthousand and lost, doubled to eight thousand and lost, and then proposed to \\ndouble to sixteen thousand. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"You can\\'t do that, you know. You\\'re only ten thousand \\ncredit with the company.\" \\n \\n\"You mean you won\\'t give me action?\" Deacon asked hoarsely. \"You mean that \\nwith eight thousand of my money you\\'re going to quit?\" \\n \\nGrief smiled and shook his head. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n104 \\n \\n\"It\\'s robbery, plain robbery,\" Deacon went on. \"You take my money and won\\'t give \\nme action.\" \\n \\n\"No, you\\'re wrong. I\\'m perfectly willing to give you what action you\\'ve got coming \\nto you. You\\'ve got two thousand pounds of action yet.\" \\n \\n\"Well, we\\'ll play it,\" Deacon took him up. \"You cut.\" \\n \\nThe game was played in silence, save for irritable remarks and curses from \\nDeacon. Silently the onlookers filled and sipped their long Scotch glasses. Grief \\ntook no notice of his opponent\\'s outbursts, but concentrated on the game. He was \\nreally playing cards, and there were fifty-two in the deck to be kept track of, and \\nof which he did keep track. Two thirds of the way through the last deal he threw \\ndown his hand. \\n \\n\"Cards put me out,\" he said. \"I have twenty-seven.\" \\n \\n\"If you\\'ve made a mistake,\" Deacon threatened, his face white and drawn. \\n \\n\"Then I shall have lost. Count them.\" \\n \\nGrief passed over his stack of takings, and Deacon, with trembling fingers, \\nverified the count. He half shoved his chair back from the table and emptied his \\nglass. He looked about him at unsympathetic faces. \\n \\n\"I fancy I\\'ll be catching the next steamer for Sydney,\" he said, and for the first \\ntime his speech was quiet and without bluster. \\n \\nAs Grief told them afterward: \"Had he whined or raised a roar I wouldn\\'t have \\ngiven him that last chance. As it was, he took his medicine like a man, and I had \\nto do it.\" \\n \\nDeacon glanced at his watch, simulated a weary yawn, and started to rise. \\n \\n\"Wait,\" Grief said. \"Do you want further action?\" \\n \\nThe other sank down in his chair, strove to speak, but could not, licked his dry \\nlips, and nodded his head. \\n \\n\"Captain Donovan here sails at daylight in the Gunga for Karo-Karo,\" Grief began \\nwith seeming irrelevance. \"Karo-Karo is a ring of sand in the sea, with a few \\nthousand cocoa-nut trees. Pandanus grows there, but they can\\'t grow sweet \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n105 \\npotatoes nor taro. There aremabout eight hundred natives, a king and two prime \\nministers, and the last three named are the only ones who wear any clothes. It\\'s a \\nsort of God-forsaken little hole, and once a year I send a schooner up from \\nGoboto. The drinking water is brackish, but old Tom Butler has survived on it for \\na dozen years. He\\'s the only white man there, and he has a boat\\'s crew of five \\nSanta Cruz boys who would run away or kill him if they could. That is why they \\nwere sent there. They can\\'t run away. He is always supplied with the hard cases \\nfrom the plantations. There are no missionaries. Two native Samoan teachers \\nwere clubbed to death on the beach when they landed several years ago. \\n \\n\"Naturally, you are wondering what it is all about. But have patience. As I have \\nsaid, Captain Donovan sails on the annual trip to Karo-Karo at daylight to-\\nmorrow. Tom Butler is old, and getting quite helpless. I\\'ve tried to retire him to \\nAustralia, but he says he wants to remain and die on Karo-Karo, and he will in \\nthe next year or so. He\\'s a queer old codger. Now the time is due for me to send \\nsome white man up to take the work off his hands. I wonder how you\\'d like the \\njob. You\\'d have to stay two years. \\n \\n\"Hold on! I\\'ve not finished. You\\'ve talked frequently of action this evening. There\\'s \\nno action in betting away what you\\'ve never sweated for. The money you\\'ve lost to \\nme was left you by your father or some other relative who did the sweating. But \\ntwo years of work as trader on Karo-Karo would mean something. I\\'ll bet the ten \\nthousand I\\'ve won from you against two years of your time. If you win, the \\nmoney\\'s yours. If you lose, you take the job at Karo-Karo and sail at daylight. \\nNow that\\'s what might be called real action. Will you play?\" \\n \\nDeacon could not speak. His throat lumped and he nodded his head as he \\nreached for the cards. \\n \\n\"One thing more,\" Grief said. \"I can do even better. If you lose, two years of your \\ntime are mine--naturally without wages. Nevertheless, I\\'ll pay you wages. If your \\nwork is satisfactory, if you observe all instructions and rules, I\\'ll pay you five \\nthousand pounds a year for two years. The money will be deposited with the \\ncompany, to be paid to you, with interest, when the time expires. Is that all \\nright?\" \\n \\n\"Too much so,\" Deacon stammered. \"You are unfair to yourself. A trader only gets \\nten or fifteen pounds a month.\" \\n \\n\"Put it down to action, then,\" Grief said, with an air of dismissal. \"And before we \\nbegin, I\\'ll jot down several of the rules. These you will repeat aloud every morning \\nduring the two years--if you lose. They are for the good of your soul. When you \\nhave repeated them aloud seven hundred and thirty Karo-Karo mornings I am \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n106 \\nconfident they will be in your memory to stay. Lend me your pen, Mac. Now, let\\'s \\nsee----\" \\n \\nHe wrote steadily and rapidly for some minutes, then proceeded to read the \\nmatter aloud: \\n \\n\"I must always remember that one man is as good as another, save and except \\nwhen he thinks he is better. \\n \\n\"No matter how drunk I am I must not fail to be a gentleman. A gentleman is a \\nman who is gentle. Note: It would be better not to get drunk. \\n \\n\"When I play a man\\'s game with men, I must play like a man. \\n \\n\"A good curse, rightly used and rarely, is an efficient thing. Too many curses spoil \\nthe cursing. Note: A curse cannot change a card seguence nor cause the wind to \\nblow. \\n \\n\"There is no license for a man to be less than a man. Ten thousand pounds \\ncannot purchase such a license.\" \\n \\nAt the beginning of the reading Deacon\\'s face had gone white with anger. Then \\nhad arisen, from neck to forehead, a slow and terrible flush that deepened to the \\nend of the reading. \\n \\n\"There, that will be all,\" Grief said, as he folded the paper and tossed it to the \\ncentre of the table. \"Are you still ready to play the game?\" \\n \\n\"I deserve it,\" Deacon muttered brokenly. \"I\\'ve been an ass. Mr. Gee, before I \\nknow whether I win or lose, I want to apologize. Maybe it was the whiskey, I don\\'t \\nknow, but I\\'m an ass, a cad, a bounder--everything that\\'s rotten.\" \\n \\nHe held out his hand, and the half-caste took it beamingly. \\n \\n\"I say, Grief,\" he blurted out, \"the boy\\'s all right. Call the whole thing off, and let\\'s \\nforget it in a final nightcap.\" \\n \\nGrief showed signs of debating, but Deacon cried: \\n \\n\"No; I won\\'t permit it. I\\'m not a quitter. If it\\'s Karo-Karo, it\\'s Karo-Karo. There\\'s \\nnothing more to it.\" \\n \\n\"Right,\" said Grief, as he began the shuffle. \"If he\\'s the right stuff to go to Karo-\\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n107 \\nKaro, Karo-Karo won\\'t do him any harm.\" \\n \\nThe game was close and hard. Three times they divided the deck between them \\nand \"cards\" was not scored. At the beginning of the fifth and last deal, Deacon \\nneeded three points to go out, and Grief needed four. \"Cards\" alone would put \\nDeacon out, and he played for \"cards\". He no longer muttered or cursed, and \\nplayed his best game of the evening. Incidentally he gathered in the two black \\naces and the ace of hearts. \\n \\n\"I suppose you can name the four cards I hold,\" he challenged, as the last of the \\ndeal was exhausted and he picked up his hand. \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"Then name them.\" \\n \\n\"The knave of spades, the deuce of spades, the tray of hearts, and the ace of \\ndiamonds,\" Grief answered. \\n \\nThose behind Deacon and looking at his hand made no sign. Yet the naming had \\nbeen correct. \\n \\n\"I fancy you play casino better than I,\" Deacon acknowledged. \"I can name only \\nthree of yours, a knave, an ace, and big casino.\" \\n \\n\"Wrong. There aren\\'t five aces in the deck. You\\'ve taken in three and you hold the \\nfourth in your hand now.\" \\n \\n\"By Jove, you\\'re right,\" Deacon admitted. \"I did scoop in three. Anyway, I\\'ll make \\n\\'cards\\' on you. That\\'s all I need.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ll let you save little casino----\" Grief paused to calculate. \"Yes, and the ace as \\nwell, and still I\\'ll make \\'cards\\' and go out with big casino. Play.\" \\n \\n\"No \\'cards\\' and I win!\" Deacon exulted as the last of the hand was played. \"I go \\nout on little casino and the four aces. \\'Big casino\\' and \\'spades\\' only bring you to \\ntwenty.\" \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"Some mistake, I\\'m afraid.\" \\n \\n\"No,\" Deacon declared positively. \"I counted every card I took in. That\\'s the one \\nthing I was correct on. I\\'ve twenty-six, and you\\'ve twenty-six.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n108 \\n\"Count again,\" Grief said. \\n \\nCarefully and slowly, with trembling fingers, Deacon counted the cards he had \\ntaken. There were twenty-five. He reached over to the corner of the table, took up \\nthe rules Grief had written, folded them, and put them in his pocket. Then he \\nemptied his glass, and stood up. Captain Donovan looked at his watch, yawned, \\nand also arose. \\n \\n\"Going aboard, Captain?\" Deacon asked. \\n \\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. \"What time shall I send the whaleboat for you?\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ll go with you now. We\\'ll pick up my luggage from the Billy as we go by, I was \\nsailing on her for Babo in the morning.\" \\n \\nDeacon shook hands all around, after receiving a final pledge of good luck on \\nKaro-Karo. \\n \\n\"Does Tom Butler play cards?\" he asked Grief. \\n \\n\"Solitaire,\" was the answer. \\n \\n\"Then I\\'ll teach him double solitaire.\" Deacon turned toward the door, where \\nCaptain Donovan waited, and added with a sigh, \"And I fancy he\\'ll skin me, too, if \\nhe plays like the rest of you island men.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n109 \\n \\nChapter Seven--THE FEATHERS OF THE SUN \\n \\n I \\n \\nIt was the island of Fitu-Iva--the last independent Polynesian stronghold in the \\nSouth Seas. Three factors conduced to Fitu-Iva\\'s independence. The first and \\nsecond were its isolation and the warlikeness of its population. But these would \\nnot have saved it in the end had it not been for the fact that Japan, France, Great \\nBritain, Germany, and the United States discovered its desirableness \\nsimultaneously. It was like gamins scrambling for a penny. They got in one \\nanother\\'s way. The war vessels of the five Powers cluttered Fitu-Iva\\'s one small \\nharbour. There were rumours of war and threats of war. Over its morning toast \\nall the world read columns about Fitu-Iva. As a Yankee blue jacket epitomized it \\nat the time, they all got their feet in the trough at once. \\n \\nSo it was that Fitu-Iva escaped even a joint protectorate, and King Tulifau, \\notherwise Tui Tulifau, continued to dispense the high justice and the low in the \\nframe-house palace built for him by a Sydney trader out of California redwood. \\nNot only was Tui Tulifau every inch a king, but he was every second a king. When \\nhe had ruled fifty-eight years and five months, he was only fifty-eight years and \\nthree months old. That is to say, he had ruled over five million seconds more than \\nhe had breathed, having been crowned two months before he was born. \\n \\nHe was a kingly king, a royal figure of a man, standing six feet and a half, and, \\nwithout being excessively fat, weighing three hundred and twenty pounds. But \\nthis was not unusual for Polynesian \"chief stock.\" Sepeli, his queen, was six feet \\nthree inches and weighed two hundred and sixty, while her brother, Uiliami, who \\ncommanded the army in the intervals of resignation from the premiership, topped \\nher by an inch and notched her an even half-hundredweight. Tui Tulifau was a \\nmerry soul, a great feaster and drinker. So were all his people merry souls, save \\nin anger, when, on occasion, they could be guilty even of throwing dead pigs at \\nthose who made them wroth. Nevertheless, on occasion, they could fight like \\nMaoris, as piratical sandalwood traders and Blackbirders in the old days learned \\nto their cost. \\n \\nII \\n \\nGrief\\'s schooner, the Cantani, had passed the Pillar Rocks at the entrance two \\nhours before and crept up the harbour to the whispering flutters of a breeze that \\ncould not make up its mind to blow. It was a cool, starlight evening, and they \\nlolled about the poop waiting till their snail\\'s pace would bring them to the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n110 \\nanchorage. Willie Smee, the supercargo, emerged from the cabin, conspicuous in \\nhis shore clothes. The mate glanced at his shirt, of the finest and whitest silk, \\nand giggled significantly. \\n \\n\"Dance, to-night, I suppose?\" Grief observed. \\n \\n\"No,\" said the mate. \"It\\'s Taitua. Willie\\'s stuck on her.\" \\n \\n\"Catch me,\" the supercargo disclaimed. \\n \\n\"Then she\\'s stuck on you, and it\\'s all the same,\" the mate went on. \"You won\\'t be \\nashore half an hour before you\\'ll have a flower behind your ear, a wreath on your \\nhead, and your arm around Taitua.\" \\n \\n\"Simple jealousy,\" Willie Smee sniffed. \"You\\'d like to have her yourself, only you \\ncan\\'t.\" \\n \\n\"I can\\'t find shirts like that, that\\'s why. I\\'ll bet you half a crown you won\\'t sail \\nfrom Fitu-Iva with that shirt.\" \\n \\n\"And if Taitua doesn\\'t get it, it\\'s an even break Tui Tulifau does,\" Grief warned. \\n\"Better not let him spot that shirt, or it\\'s all day with it.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s right,\" Captain Boig agreed, turning his head from watching the house \\nlights on the shore. \"Last voyage he fined one of my Kanakas out of a fancy belt \\nand sheath-knife.\" He turned to the mate. \"You can let go any time, Mr. Marsh. \\nDon\\'t give too much slack. There\\'s no sign of wind, and in the morning we may \\nshift opposite the copra-sheds.\" \\n \\nA minute later the anchor rumbled down. The whaleboat, already hoisted out, lay \\nalongside, and the shore-going party dropped into it. Save for the Kanakas, who \\nwere all bent for shore, only Grief and the supercargo were in the boat. At the \\nhead of the little coral-stone pier Willie Smee, with an apologetic gurgle, separated \\nfrom his employer and disappeared down an avenue of palms. Grief turned in the \\nopposite direction past the front of the old mission church. Here, among the \\ngraves on the beach, lightly clad in ahu\\'s and lava-lavas, flower-crowned and \\ngarlanded, with great phosphorescent hibiscus blossoms in their hair, youths and \\nmaidens were dancing. Farther on, Grief passed the long, grass-built himine \\nhouse, where a few score of the elders sat in long rows chanting the old hymns \\ntaught them by forgotten missionaries. He passed also the palace of Tui Tulifau, \\nwhere, by the lights and sounds, he knew the customary revelry was going on. \\nFor of the happy South Sea isles, Fitu-Iva was the happiest. They feasted and \\nfrolicked at births and deaths, and the dead and the unborn were likewise \\n', \"www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n111 \\nfeasted. \\n \\nGrief held steadily along the Broom Road, which curved and twisted through a \\nlush growth of flowers and fern-like algarobas. The warm air was rich with \\nperfume, and overhead, outlined against the stars, were fruit-burdened mangoes, \\nstately avocado trees, and slender-tufted palms. Every here and there were grass \\nhouses. Voices and laughter rippled through the darkness. Out on the water \\nflickering lights and soft-voiced choruses marked the fishers returning from the \\nreef. \\n \\nAt last Grief stepped aside from the road, stumbling over a pig that grunted \\nindignantly. Looking through an open door, he saw a stout and elderly native \\nsitting on a heap of mats a dozen deep. From time to time, automatically, he \\nbrushed his naked legs with a cocoa-nut-fibre fly-flicker. He wore glasses, and \\nwas reading methodically in what Grief knew to be an English Bible. For this was \\nIeremia, his trader, so named from the prophet Jeremiah. \\n \\nIeremia was lighter-skinned than the Fitu-Ivans, as was natural in a full-blooded \\nSamoan. Educated by the missionaries, as lay teacher he had served their cause \\nwell over in the cannibal atolls to the westward. As a reward, he had been sent to \\nthe paradise of Fitu-Iva, where all were or had been good converts, to gather in \\nthe backsliders. Unfortunately, Ieremia had become too well educated. A stray \\nvolume of Darwin, a nagging wife, and a pretty Fitu-Ivan widow had driven him \\ninto the ranks of the backsliders. It was not a case of apostasy. The effect of \\nDarwin had been one of intellectual fatigue. What was the use of trying to \\nunderstand this vastly complicated and enigmatical world, especially when one \\nwas married to a nagging woman? As Ieremia slackened in his labours, the \\nmission board threatened louder and louder to send him back to the atolls, while \\nhis wife's tongue grew correspondingly sharper. Tui Tulifau was a sympathetic \\nmonarch, whose queen, on occasions when he was particularly drunk, was \\nknown to beat him. For political reasons--the queen belonging to as royal stock \\nas himself and her brother commanding the army--Tui Tulifau could not divorce \\nher, but he could and did divorce Ieremia, who promptly took up with commercial \\nlife and the lady of his choice. As an independent trader he had failed, chiefly \\nbecause of the disastrous patronage of Tui Tulifau. To refuse credit to that merry \\nmonarch was to invite confiscation; to grant him credit was certain bankruptcy. \\nAfter a year's idleness on the beach, leremia had become David Grief's trader, and \\nfor a dozen years his service had been honourable and efficient, for Grief had \\nproven the first man who successfully refused credit to the king or who collected \\nwhen it had been accorded. \\n \\nIeremia looked gravely over the rims of his glasses when his employer entered, \\ngravely marked the place in the Bible and set it aside, and gravely shook hands. \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n112 \\n \\n\"I am glad you came in person,\" he said. \\n \\n\"How else could I come?\" Grief laughed. \\n \\nBut Ieremia had no sense of humour, and he ignored the remark. \\n \\n\"The commercial situation on the island is damn bad,\" he said with great \\nsolemnity and an unctuous mouthing of the many-syllabled words. \"My ledger \\naccount is shocking.\" \\n \\n\"Trade bad?\" \\n \\n\"On the contrary. It has been excellent. The shelves are empty, exceedingly \\nempty. But----\" His eyes glistened proudly. \"But there are many goods remaining \\nin the storehouse; I have kept it carefully locked.\" \\n \\n\"Been allowing Tui Tulifau too much credit?\" \\n \\n\"On the contrary. There has been no credit at all. And every old account has been \\nsettled up.\" \\n \\n\"I don\\'t follow you, Ieremia,\" Grief confessed. \"What\\'s the joke?--shelves empty, no \\ncredit, old accounts all square, storehouse carefully locked--what\\'s the answer?\" \\n \\nIeremia did not reply immediately. Reaching under the rear corner of the mats, he \\ndrew forth a large cash-box. Grief noted and wondered that it was not locked. The \\nSamoan had always been fastidiously cautious in guarding cash. The box seemed \\nfilled with paper money. He skinned off the top note and passed it over. \\n \\n\"There is the answer.\" \\n \\nGrief glanced at a fairly well executed banknote. \"The First Royal Bank of Fitu-Iva \\nwill pay to bearer on demand one pound sterling,\" he read. In the centre was the \\nsmudged likeness of a native face. At the bottom was the signature of Tui Tulifau, \\nand the signature of Fulualea, with the printed information appended, \\n\"Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" \\n \\n\"Who the deuce is Fulualea?\" Grief demanded. \"It\\'s Fijian, isn\\'t it?--meaning the \\nfeathers of the sun?\" \\n \\n\"Just so. It means the feathers of the sun. Thus does this base interloper caption \\nhimself. He has come up from Fiji to turn Fitu-Iva upside down--that is, \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n113 \\ncommercially.\" \\n \\n\"Some one of those smart Levuka boys, I suppose?\" \\n \\nIeremia shook his head sadly. \"No, this low fellow is a white man and a \\nscoundrel. He has taken a noble and high-sounding Fijian name and dragged it \\nin the dirt to suit his nefarious purposes. He has made Tui Tulifau drunk. He has \\nmade him very drunk. He has kept him very drunk all the time. In return, he has \\nbeen made Chancellor of the Exchequer and other things. He has issued this \\nfalse paper and compelled the people to receive it. He has levied a store tax, a \\ncopra tax, and a tobacco tax. There are harbour dues and regulations, and other \\ntaxes. But the people are not taxed--only the traders. When the copra tax was \\nlevied, I lowered the purchasing price accordingly. Then the people began to \\ngrumble, and Feathers of the Sun passed a new law, setting the old price back \\nand forbidding any man to lower it. Me he fined two pounds and five pigs, it being \\nwell known that I possessed five pigs. You will find them entered in the ledger. \\nHawkins, who is trader for the Fulcrum Company, was fined first pigs, then gin, \\nand, because he continued to make loud conversation, the army came and \\nburned his store. When I declined to sell, this Feathers of the Sun fined me once \\nmore and promised to burn the store if again I offended. So I sold all that was on \\nthe shelves, and there is the box full of worthless paper. I shall be chagrined if \\nyou pay me my salary in paper, but it would be just, no more than just. Now, \\nwhat is to be done?\" \\n \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders. \"I must first see this Feathers of the Sun and size \\nup the situation.\" \\n \\n\"Then you must see him soon,\" Ieremia advised. \"Else he will have an \\naccumulation of many fines against you. Thus does he absorb all the coin of the \\nrealm. He has it all now, save what has been buried in the ground.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nOn his way back along the Broom Road, under the lighted lamps that marked the \\nentrance to the palace grounds, Grief encountered a short, rotund gentleman, in \\nunstarched ducks, smooth-shaven and of florid complexion, who was just \\nemerging. Something about his tentative, saturated gait was familiar. Grief knew \\nit on the instant. On the beaches of a dozen South Sea ports had he seen it \\nbefore. \\n \\n\"Of all men, Cornelius Deasy!\" he cried. \\n \\n\"If it ain\\'t Grief himself, the old devil,\" was the return greeting, as they shook \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n114 \\nhands. \\n \\n\"If you\\'ll come on board I\\'ve some choice smoky Irish,\" Grief invited. \\n \\nCornelius threw back his shoulders and stiffened. \\n \\n\"Nothing doin\\', Mr. Grief. \\'Tis Fulualea I am now. No blarneyin\\' of old times for \\nme. Also, and by the leave of his gracious Majesty King Tulifau, \\'tis Chancellor of \\nthe Exchequer I am, an\\' Chief Justice I am, save in moments of royal sport when \\nthe king himself chooses to toy with the wheels of justice.\" \\n \\nGrief whistled his amazement. \"So you\\'re Feathers of the Sun!\" \\n \\n\"I prefer the native idiom,\" was the correction. \"Fulualea, an\\' it please you. Not \\nforgettin\\' old times, Mr. Grief, it sorrows the heart of me to break you the news. \\nYou\\'ll have to pay your legitimate import duties same as any other trader with \\nmind intent on robbin\\' the gentle Polynesian savage on coral isles implanted. ----\\nWhere was I? Ah! I remember. You\\'ve violated the regulations. With malice intent \\nhave you entered the port of Fitu-Iva after sunset without sidelights burnin\\'. \\nDon\\'t interrupt. With my own eyes did I see you. For which offence are you fined \\nthe sum of five pounds. Have you any gin? \\'Tis a serious offence. Not lightly are \\nthe lives of the mariners of our commodious port to be risked for the savin\\' of a \\npenny\\'orth of oil. Did I ask: have you any gin? Tis the harbour master that asks.\" \\n \\n\"You\\'ve taken a lot on your shoulders,\" Grief grinned. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis the white man\\'s burden. These rapscallion traders have been puttin\\' it all \\nover poor Tui Tulif, the best-hearted old monarch that ever sat a South Sea \\nthrone an\\' mopped grog-root from the imperial calabash. \\'Tis I, Cornelius--\\nFulualea, rather--that am here to see justice done. Much as I dislike the doin\\' of \\nit, as harbour master \\'tis my duty to find you guilty of breach of quarantine.\" \\n \\n\"Quarantine?\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis the rulin\\' of the port doctor. No intercourse with the shore till the ship is \\npassed. What dire calamity to the confidin\\' native if chicken pox or whoopin\\' \\ncough was aboard of you! Who is there to protect the gentle, confidin\\' Polynesian? \\nI, Fulualea, the Feathers of the Sun, on my high mission.\" \\n \\n\"Who in hell is the port doctor?\" Grief queried. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis me, Fulualea. Your offence is serious. Consider yourself fined five cases of \\nfirst-quality Holland gin.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n115 \\n \\nGrief laughed heartily. \"We\\'ll compromise, Cornelius. Come aboard and have a \\ndrink.\" \\n \\nThe Feathers of the Sun waved the proffer aside grandly. \"\\'Tis bribery. I\\'ll have \\nnone of it--me faithful to my salt. And wherefore did you not present your ship\\'s \\npapers? As chief of the custom house you are fined five pounds and two more \\ncases of gin.\" \\n \\n\"Look here, Cornelius. A joke\\'s a joke, but this one has gone far enough. This is \\nnot Levuka. I\\'ve half a mind to pull your nose for you. You can\\'t buck me.\" \\n \\nThe Feathers of the Sun retreated unsteadily and in alarm. \\n \\n\"Lay no violence on me,\" he threatened. \"You\\'re right. This is not Levuka. And by \\nthe same token, with Tui Tulifau and the royal army behind me, buck you is just \\nthe thing I can and will. You\\'ll pay them fines promptly, or I\\'ll confiscate your \\nvessel. You\\'re not the first. What does that Chink pearl-buyer, Peter Gee, do but \\nslip into harbour, violatin\\' all regulations an\\' makin\\' rough house for the matter \\nof a few paltry fines. No; he wouldn\\'t pay \\'em, and he\\'s on the beach now thinkin\\' \\nit over.\" \\n \\n\"You don\\'t mean to say----\" \\n \\n\"Sure an\\' I do. In the high exercise of office I seized his schooner. A fifth of the \\nloyal army is now in charge on board of her. She\\'ll be sold this day week. Some \\nten tons of shell in the hold, and I\\'m wonderin\\' if I can trade it to you for gin. I \\ncan promise you a rare bargain. How much gin did you say you had?\" \\n \\n\"Still more gin, eh?\" \\n \\n\"An\\' why not? \\'Tis a royal souse is Tui Tulifau. Sure it keeps my wits workin\\' \\novertime to supply him, he\\'s that amazin\\' liberal with it. The whole gang of \\nhanger-on chiefs is perpetually loaded to the guards. It\\'s disgraceful. Are you \\ngoin\\' to pay them fines, Mr. Grief, or is it to harsher measures I\\'ll be forced?\" \\n \\nGrief turned impatiently on his heel. \\n \\n\"Cornelius, you\\'re drunk. Think it over and come to your senses. The old \\nrollicking South Sea days are gone. You can\\'t play tricks like that now.\" \\n \\n\"If you think you\\'re goin\\' on board, Mr. Grief, I\\'ll save you the trouble. I know \\nyour kind, I foresaw your stiff-necked stubbornness. An\\' it\\'s forestalled you are. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n116 \\n\\'Tis on the beach you\\'ll find your crew. The vessel\\'s seized.\" \\n \\nGrief turned back on him in the half-belief still that he was joking. Fulualea again \\nretreated in alarm. The form of a large man loomed beside him in the darkness. \\n \\n\"Is it you, Uiliami?\" Fulualea crooned. \"Here is another sea pirate. Stand by me \\nwith the strength of thy arm, O Herculean brother.\" \\n \\n\"Greeting, Uiliami,\" Grief said. \"Since when has Fitu-Iva come to be run by a \\nLevuka beachcomber? He says my schooner has been seized. Is it true?\" \\n \\n\"It is true,\" Uiliami boomed from his deep chest. \"Have you any more silk shirts \\nlike Willie Smee\\'s? Tui Tulifau would like such a shirt. He has heard of it.\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis all the same,\" Fulualea interrupted. \"Shirts or schooners, the king shall have \\nthem.\" \\n \\n\"Rather high-handed, Cornelius,\" Grief murmured. \"It\\'s rank piracy. You seized \\nmy vessel without giving me a chance.\" \\n \\n\"A chance is it? As we stood here, not five minutes gone, didn\\'t you refuse to pay \\nyour fines?\" \\n \\n\"But she was already seized.\" \\n \\n\"Sure, an\\' why not? Didn\\'t I know you\\'d refuse? \\'Tis all fair, an\\' no injustice done-\\n-Justice, the bright, particular star at whose shining altar Cornelius Deasy--or \\nFulualea, \\'tis the same thing--ever worships. Get thee gone, Mr. Trader, or I\\'ll set \\nthe palace guards on you. Uiliami, \\'tis a desperate character, this trader man. \\nCall the guards.\" \\n \\nUiliami blew the whistle suspended on his broad bare chest by a cord of cocoanut \\nsennit. Grief reached out an angry hand for Cornelius, who titubated into safety \\nbehind Uiliami\\'s massive bulk. A dozen strapping Polynesians, not one under six \\nfeet, ran down the palace walk and ranged behind their commander. \\n \\n\"Get thee gone, Mr. Trader,\" Cornelius ordered. \"The interview is terminated. We\\'ll \\ntry your several cases in the mornin\\'. Appear promptly at the palace at ten o\\'clock \\nto answer to the followin\\' charges, to wit: breach of the peace; seditious and \\ntreasonable utterance; violent assault on the chief magistrate with intent to cut, \\nwound, maim, an\\' bruise; breach of quarantine; violation of harbour regulations; \\nand gross breakage of custom house rules. In the mornin\\', fellow, in the mornin\\', \\njustice shall be done while the breadfruit falls. And the Lord have mercy on your \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n117 \\nsoul.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nBefore the hour set for the trial Grief, accompanied by Peter Gee, won access to \\nTui Tulifau. The king, surrounded by half a dozen chiefs, lay on mats under the \\nshade of the avocados in the palace compound. Early as was the hour, palace \\nmaids were industriously serving squarefaces of gin. The king was glad to see his \\nold friend Davida, and regretful that he had run foul of the new regulations. \\nBeyond that he steadfastly avoided discussion of the matter in hand. All protests \\nof the expropriated traders were washed away in proffers of gin. \"Have a drink,\" \\nwas his invariable reply, though once he unbosomed himself enough to say that \\nFeathers of the Sun was a wonderful man. Never had palace affairs been so \\nprosperous. Never had there been so much money in the treasury, nor so much \\ngin in circulation. \"Well pleased am I with Fulualea,\" he concluded. \"Have a \\ndrink.\" \\n \\n\"We\\'ve got to get out of this pronto,\" Grief whispered to Peter Gee a few minutes \\nlater, \"or we\\'ll be a pair of boiled owls. Also, I am to be tried for arson, or heresy, \\nor leprosy, or something, in a few minutes, and I must control my wits.\" \\n \\nAs they withdrew from the royal presence, Grief caught a glimpse of Sepeli, the \\nqueen. She was peering out at her royal spouse and his fellow tipplers, and the \\nfrown on her face gave Grief his cue. Whatever was to be accomplished must be \\nthrough her. \\n \\nIn another shady corner of the big compound Cornelius was holding court. He \\nhad been at it early, for when Grief arrived the case of Willie Smee was being \\nsettled. The entire royal army, save that portion in charge of the seized vessels, \\nwas in attendance. \\n \\n\"Let the defendant stand up,\" said Cornelius, \"and receive the just and merciful \\nsentence of the Court for licentious and disgraceful conduct unbecomin\\' a \\nsupercargo. The defendant says he has no money. Very well. The Court regrets it \\nhas no calaboose. In lieu thereof, and in view of the impoverished condition of the \\ndefendant, the Court fines said defendant one white silk shirt of the same kind, \\nmake and quality at present worn by defendant.\" \\n \\nCornelius nodded to several of the soldiers, who led the supercargo away behind \\nan avocado tree. A minute later he emerged, minus the garment in question, and \\nsat down beside Grief. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n118 \\n\"What have you been up to?\" Grief asked. \\n \\n\"Blessed if I know. What crimes have you committed?\" \\n \\n\"Next case,\" said Cornelius in his most extra-legal tones. \"David Grief, defendant, \\nstand up. The Court has considered the evidence in the case, or cases, and \\nrenders the following judgment, to wit:--Shut up!\" he thundered at Grief, who had \\nattempted to interrupt. \"I tell you the evidence has been considered, deeply \\nconsidered. It is no wish of the Court to lay additional hardship on the defendant, \\nand the Court takes this opportunity to warn the defendant that he is liable for \\ncontempt. For open and wanton violation of harbour rules and regulations, \\nbreach of quarantine, and disregard of shipping laws, his schooner, the Cantani, \\nis hereby declared confiscated to the Government of Fitu-Iva, to be sold at public \\nauction, ten days from date, with all appurtenances, fittings, and cargo thereunto \\npertaining. For the personal crimes of the defendant, consisting of violent and \\nturbulent conduct and notorious disregard of the laws of the realm, he is fined in \\nthe sum of one hundred pounds sterling and fifteen cases of gin. I will not ask \\nyou if you have anything to say. But will you pay? That is the question.\" \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"In the meantime,\" Cornelius went on, \"consider yourself a prisoner at large. \\nThere is no calaboose in which to confine you. And finally, it has come to the \\nknowledge of the Court, that at an early hour of this morning, the defendant did \\nwilfully and deliberately send Kanakas in his employ out on the reef to catch fish \\nfor breakfast. This is distinctly an infringement of the rights of the fisherfolk of \\nFitu-Iva. Home industries must be protected. This conduct of the defendant is \\nseverely reprehended by the Court, and on any repetition of the offence the \\noffender and offenders, all and sundry, shall be immediately put to hard labour \\non the improvement of the Broom Road. The court is dismissed.\" \\n \\nAs they left the compound, Peter Gee nudged Grief to look where Tui Tulifau \\nreclined on the mats. The supercargo\\'s shirt, stretched and bulged, already \\nencased the royal fat. \\n \\nIV \\n \\n\"The thing is clear,\" said Peter Gee, at a conference in Ieremia\\'s house. \"Deasy \\nhas about gathered in all the coin. In the meantime he keeps the king going on \\nthe gin he\\'s captured, on our vessels. As soon as he can maneuver it he\\'ll take the \\ncash and skin out on your craft or mine.\" \\n \\n\"He is a low fellow,\" Ieremia declared, pausing in the polishing of his spectacles. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n119 \\n\"He is a scoundrel and a blackguard. He should be struck by a dead pig, by a \\nparticularly dead pig.\" \\n \\n\"The very thing,\" said Grief. \"He shall be struck by a dead pig. Ieremia, I should \\nnot be surprised if you were the man to strike him with the dead pig. Be sure and \\nselect a particularly dead one. Tui Tulifau is down at the boat house broaching a \\ncase of my Scotch. I\\'m going up to the palace to work kitchen politics with the \\nqueen. In the meantime you get a few things on your shelves from the store-room. \\nI\\'ll lend you some, Hawkins. And you, Peter, see the German store. Start in all of \\nyou, selling for paper. Remember, I\\'ll back the losses. If I\\'m not mistaken, in three \\ndays we\\'ll have a national council or a revolution. You, Ieremia, start messengers \\naround the island to the fishers and farmers, everywhere, even to the mountain \\ngoat-hunters. Tell them to assemble at the palace three days from now.\" \\n \\n\"But the soldiers,\" Ieremia objected. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll take care of them. They haven\\'t been paid for two months. Besides, Uiliami is \\nthe queen\\'s brother. Don\\'t have too much on your shelves at a time. As soon as \\nthe soldiers show up with paper, stop selling.\" \\n \\n\"Then will they burn the stores,\" said Ieremia. \\n \\n\"Let them. King Tulifau will pay for it if they do.\" \\n \\n\"Will he pay for my shirt?\" Willie Smee demanded. \\n \\n\"That is purely a personal and private matter between you and Tui Tulifau,\" Grief \\nanswered. \\n \\n\"It\\'s beginning to split up the back,\" the supercargo lamented. \"I noticed that \\nmuch this morning when he hadn\\'t had it on ten minutes. It cost me thirty \\nshillings and I only wore it once.\" \\n \\n\"Where shall I get a dead pig?\" Ieremia asked. \\n \\n\"Kill one, of course,\" said Grief. \"Kill a small one.\" \\n \\n\"A small one is worth ten shillings.\" \\n \\n\"Then enter it in your ledger under operating expenses.\" Grief paused a moment. \\n\"If you want it particularly dead, it would be well to kill it at once.\" \\n \\nV \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n120 \\n \\n\"You have spoken well, Davida,\" said Queen Sepeli. \"This Fulualea has brought a \\nmadness with him, and Tui Tulifau is drowned in gin. If he does not grant the big \\ncouncil, I shall give him a beating. He is easy to beat when he is in drink.\" \\n \\nShe doubled up her fist, and such were her Amazonian proportions and the \\ndetermination in her face that Grief knew the council would be called. So akin \\nwas the Fitu-Ivan tongue to the Samoan that he spoke it like a native. \\n \\n\"And you, Uiliami,\" he said, \"have pointed out that the soldiers have demanded \\ncoin and refused the paper Fulualea has offered them. Tell them to take the paper \\nand see that they be paid to-morrow.\" \\n \\n\"Why trouble?\" Uiliami objected. \"The king remains happily drunk. There is much \\nmoney in the treasury. And I am content. In my house are two cases of gin and \\nmuch goods from Hawkins\\'s store.\" \\n \\n\"Excellent pig, O my brother!\" Sepeli erupted. \"Has not Davida spoken? Have you \\nno ears? When the gin and the goods in your house are gone, and no more \\ntraders come with gin and goods, and Feathers of the Sun has run away to \\nLevuka with all the cash money of Fitu-Iva, what then will you do? Cash money is \\nsilver and gold, but paper is only paper. I tell you the people are grumbling. There \\nis no fish in the palace. Yams and sweet potatoes seem to have fled from the soil, \\nfor they come not. The mountain dwellers have sent no wild goat in a week. \\nThough Feathers of the Sun compels the traders to buy copra at the old price, the \\npeople sell not, for they will have none of the paper money. Only to-day have I \\nsent messengers to twenty houses. There are no eggs. Has Feathers of the Sun \\nput a blight upon the hens? I do not know. All I know is that there are no eggs. \\nWell it is that those who drink much eat little, else would there be a palace \\nfamine. Tell your soldiers to receive their pay. Let it be in his paper money.\" \\n \\n\"And remember,\" Grief warned, \"though there be selling in the stores, when the \\nsoldiers come with their paper it will be refused. And in three days will be the \\ncouncil, and Feathers of the Sun will be as dead as a dead pig.\" \\n \\nVI \\n \\nThe day of the council found the population of the island crowded into the \\ncapital. By canoe and whaleboat, on foot and donkey-back, the five thousand \\ninhabitants of Fitu-Iva had trooped in. The three intervening days had had their \\nshare of excitement. At first there had been much selling from the sparse shelves \\nof the traders. But when the soldiers appeared, their patronage was declined and \\nthey were told to go to Fulualea for coin. \"Says it not so on the face of the paper,\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n121 \\nthe traders demanded, \"that for the asking the coin will be given in exchange?\" \\n \\nOnly the strong authority of Uiliami had prevented the burning of the traders\\' \\nhouses. As it was, one of Grief\\'s copra-sheds went up in smoke and was duly \\ncharged by Ieremia to the king\\'s account. Ieremia himself had been abused and \\nmocked, and his spectacles broken. The skin was off Willie Smee\\'s knuckles. This \\nhad been caused by three boisterous soldiers who violently struck their jaws \\nthereon in quick succession. Captain Boig was similarly injured. Peter Gee had \\ncome off undamaged, because it chanced that it was bread-baskets and not jaws \\nthat struck him on the fists. \\n \\nTui Tulifau, with Sepeli at his side and surrounded by his convivial chiefs, sat at \\nthe head of the council in the big compound. His right eye and jaw were swollen \\nas if he too had engaged in assaulting somebody\\'s fist. It was palace gossip that \\nmorning that Sepeli had administered a conjugal beating. At any rate, her spouse \\nwas sober, and his fat bulged spiritlessly through the rips in Willie Smee\\'s silk \\nshirt. His thirst was prodigious, and he was continually served with young \\ndrinking nuts. Outside the compound, held back by the army, was the mass of \\nthe common people. Only the lesser chiefs, village maids, village beaux, and \\ntalking men with their staffs of office were permitted inside. Cornelius Deasy, as \\nbefitted a high and favoured official, sat near to the right hand of the king. On the \\nleft of the queen, opposite Cornelius and surrounded by the white traders he was \\nto represent, sat Ieremia. Bereft of his spectacles, he peered short-sightedly \\nacross at the Chancellor of the Exchequer. \\n \\nIn turn, the talking man of the windward coast, the talking man of the leeward \\ncoast, and the talking man of the mountain villages, each backed by his group of \\nlesser talking men and chiefs, arose and made oration. What they said was much \\nthe same. They grumbled about the paper money. Affairs were not prosperous. No \\nmore copra was being smoked. The people were suspicious. To such a pass had \\nthings come that all people wanted to pay their debts and no one wanted to be \\npaid. Creditors made a practice of running away from debtors. The money was \\ncheap. Prices were going up and commodities were getting scarce. It cost three \\ntimes the ordinary price to buy a fowl, and then it was tough and like to die of old \\nage if not immediately sold. The outlook was gloomy. There were signs and \\nomens. There was a plague of rats in some districts. The crops were bad. The \\ncustard apples were small. The best-bearing avocado on the windward coast had \\nmysteriously shed all its leaves. The taste had gone from the mangoes. The \\nplantains were eaten by a worm. The fish had forsaken the ocean and vast \\nnumbers of tiger-sharks appeared. The wild goats had fled to inaccessible \\nsummits. The poi in the poi-pits had turned bitter. There were rumblings in the \\nmountains, night-walking of spirits; a woman of Punta-Puna had been struck \\nspeechless, and a five-legged she-goat had been born in the village of Eiho. And \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n122 \\nthat all was due to the strange money of Fulualea was the firm conviction of the \\nelders in the village councils assembled. \\n \\nUiliami spoke for the army. His men were discontented and mutinous. Though by \\nroyal decree the traders were bidden accept the money, yet did they refuse it. He \\nwould not say, but it looked as if the strange money of Fulualea had something to \\ndo with it. \\n \\nIeremia, as talking man of the traders, next spoke. When he arose, it was \\nnoticeable that he stood with legs spraddled over a large grass basket. He dwelt \\nupon the cloth of the traders, its variety and beauty and durability, which so \\nexceeded the Fitu-Ivan wet-pounded tapa, fragile and coarse. No one wore tapa \\nany more. Yet all had worn tapa, and nothing but tapa, before the traders came. \\nThere was the mosquito-netting, sold for a song, that the cleverest Fitu-Ivan net-\\nweaver could not duplicate in a thousand years. He enlarged on the incomparable \\nvirtues of rifles, axes, and steel fishhooks, down through needles, thread and \\ncotton fish-lines to white flour and kerosene oil. \\n \\nHe expounded at length, with firstlies and secondlies and all minor subdivisions \\nof argument, on organization, and order, and civilization. He contended that the \\ntrader was the bearer of civilization, and that the trader must be protected in his \\ntrade else he would not come. Over to the westward were islands which would not \\nprotect the traders. What was the result? The traders would not come, and the \\npeople were like wild animals. They wore no clothes, no silk shirts (here he peered \\nand blinked significantly at the king), and they ate one another. \\n \\nThe queer paper of the Feathers of the Sun was not money. The traders knew \\nwhat money was, and they would not receive it. If Fitu-Iva persisted in trying to \\nmake them receive it they would go away and never come back. And then the \\nFitu-Ivans, who had forgotten how to make tapa, would run around naked and \\neat one another. \\n \\nMuch more he said, talking a solid hour, and always coming back to what their \\ndire condition would be when the traders came no more. \"And in that day,\" he \\nperorated, \"how will the Fitu-Ivan be known in the great world? Kai-kanak* will \\nmen call him. \\'Kiakanak! Kai-kanak!\" \\n \\n     * Man-eater. \\n \\nTui Tulifau spoke briefly. The case had been presented, he said, for the people, \\nthe army, and the traders. It was now time for Feathers of the Sun to present his \\nside. It could not be denied that he had wrought wonders with his financial \\nsystem. \"Many times has he explained to me the working of his system,\" Tui Tulif \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n123 \\nau concluded. \"It is very simple. And now he will explain it to you.\" \\n \\nIt was a conspiracy of the white traders, Cornelius contended. Ieremia was right \\nso far as concerned the manifold blessings of white flour and kerosene oil. Fitu-\\nIva did not want to become kai-kanak. Fitu-Iva wanted civilization; it wanted \\nmore and more civilization. Now that was the very point, and they must follow \\nhim closely. Paper money was an earmark of higher civilization. That was why he, \\nthe Feathers of the Sun, had introduced it. And that was why the traders opposed \\nit. They did not want to see Fitu-Iva civilized. Why did they come across the far \\nocean stretches with their goods to Fitu-Iva? He, the Feathers of the Sun, would \\ntell them why, to their faces, in grand council assembled. In their own countries \\nmen were too civilized to let the traders make the immense profits that they made \\nout of the Fitu-Ivans. If the Fitu-Ivans became properly civilized, the trade of the \\ntraders would be gone. In that day every Fitu-Ivan could become a trader if he \\npleased. \\n \\nThat was why the white traders fought the system of paper money, that he, the \\nFeathers of the Sun, had brought. Why was he called the Feathers of the Sun? \\nBecause he was the Light-Bringer from the World Beyond the Sky. The paper \\nmoney was the light. The robbing white traders could not flourish in the light. \\nTherefore they fought the light. \\n \\nHe would prove it to the good people of Fitu-Iva, and he would prove it out of the \\nmouths of his enemies. It was a well-known fact that all highly civilized countries \\nhad paper-money systems. He would ask Ieremia if this was not so. \\n \\nIeremia did not answer. \\n \\n\"You see,\" Cornelius went on, \"he makes no answer. He cannot deny what is true. \\nEngland, France, Germany, America, all the great Papalangi countries, have the \\npaper-money system. It works. From century to century it works. I challenge you, \\nIeremia, as an honest man, as one who was once a zealous worker in the Lord\\'s \\nvineyard, I challenge you to deny that in the great Papalangi countries the system \\nworks.\" \\n \\nIeremia could not deny, and his fingers played nervously with the fastening of the \\nbasket on his knees. \\n \\n\"You see, it is as I have said,\" Cornelius continued. \"Ieremia agrees that it is so. \\nTherefore, I ask you, all good people of Fitu-Iva, if a system is good for the \\nPapalangi countries, why is it not good for Fitu-Iva?\" \\n \\n\"It is not the same!\" Ieremia cried. \"The paper of the Feathers of the Sun is \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n124 \\ndifferent from the paper of the great countries.\" \\n \\nThat Cornelius had been prepared for this was evident. He held up a Fitu-Ivan \\nnote that was recognized by all. \\n \\n\"What is that?\" he demanded. \\n \\n\"Paper, mere paper,\" was Ieremia\\'s reply. \\n \\n\"And that?\" \\n \\nThis time Cornelius held up a Bank of England note. \\n \\n\"It is the paper money of the English,\" he explained to the Council, at the same \\ntime extending it for Ieremia to examine. \"Is it not true, Ieremia, that it is paper \\nmoney of the English?\" \\n \\nIeremia nodded reluctantly. \\n \\n\"You have said that the paper money of Fitu-Iva was paper, now how about this \\nof the English? What is it?.... You must answer like a true man... All wait for your \\nanswer, Ieremia.\" \\n \\n\"It is--it is----\" the puzzled Ieremia began, then spluttered helplessly, the fallacy \\nbeyond his penetration. \\n \\n\"Paper, mere paper,\" Cornelius concluded for him, imitating his halting utterance. \\n \\nConviction sat on the faces of all. The king clapped his hands admiringly and \\nmurmured, \"It is most clear, very clear.\" \\n \\n\"You see, he himself acknowledges it.\" Assured triumph was in Deasy\\'s voice and \\nbearing. \"He knows of no difference. There is no difference. \\'Tis the very image of \\nmoney. \\'Tis money itself.\" \\n \\nIn the meantime Grief was whispering in Ieremia\\'s ear, who nodded and began to \\nspeak. \\n \\n\"But it is well known to all the Papalangi that the English Government will pay \\ncoin money for the paper.\" \\n \\nDeasy\\'s victory was now absolute. He held aloft a Fitu-Ivan note. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n125 \\n\"Is it not so written on this paper as well?\" \\n \\nAgain Grief whispered. \\n \\n\"That Fitu-Iva will pay coin money?\" asked Ieremia \\n \\n\"It is so written.\" \\n \\nA third time Grief prompted. \\n \\n\"On demand?\" asked Ieremia. \\n \\n\"On demand,\" Cornelius assured him. \\n \\n\"Then I demand coin money now,\" said Ieremia, drawing a small package of notes \\nfrom the pouch at his girdle. \\n \\nCornelius scanned the package with a quick, estimating eye. \\n \\n\"Very well,\" he agreed. \"I shall give you the coin money now. How much?\" \\n \\n\"And we will see the system work,\" the king proclaimed, partaking in his \\nChancellor\\'s triumph. \\n \\n\"You have heard!--He will give coin money now!\" Ieremia cried in a loud voice to \\nthe assemblage. \\n \\nAt the same time he plunged both hands in the basket and drew forth many \\npackages of Fitu-Ivan notes. It was noticed that a peculiar odour was adrift about \\nthe council. \\n \\n\"I have here,\" Ieremia announced, \"one thousand and twenty-eight pounds twelve \\nshillings and sixpence. Here is a sack to put the coin money in.\" \\n \\nCornelius recoiled. He had not expected such a sum, and everywhere about the \\ncouncil his uneasy eyes showed him chiefs and talking men drawing out bundles \\nof notes. The army, its two months\\' pay in its hands, pressed forward to the edge \\nof the council, while behind it the populace, with more money, invaded the \\ncompound. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis a run on the bank you\\'ve precipitated,\" he said reproachfully to Grief. \\n \\n\"Here is the sack to put the coin money in,\" Ieremia urged. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n126 \\n \\n\"It must be postponed,\" Cornelius said desperately, \"\\'Tis not in banking hours.\" \\n \\nIeremia flourished a package of money. \"Nothing of banking hours is written here. \\nIt says on demand, and I now demand.\" \\n \\n\"Let them come to-morrow, O Tui Tulifau,\" Cornelius appealed to the king. \"They \\nshall be paid to-morrow.\" \\n \\nTui Tulifau hesitated, but his spouse glared at him, her brawny arm tensing as \\nthe fist doubled into a redoubtable knot, Tui Tulifau tried to look away, but failed. \\nHe cleared his throat nervously. \\n \\n\"We will see the system work,\" he decreed. \"The people have come far.\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis good money you\\'re asking me to pay out,\" Deasy muttered in a low voice to \\nthe king. \\n \\nSepeli caught what he said, and grunted so savagely as to startle the king, who \\ninvoluntarily shrank away from her. \\n \\n\"Forget not the pig,\" Grief whispered to Ieremia, who immediately stood up. \\n \\nWith a sweeping gesture he stilled the babel of voices that was beginning to rise. \\n \\n\"It was an ancient and honourable custom of Fitu-Iva,\" he said, \"that when a man \\nwas proved a notorious evildoer his joints were broken with a club and he was \\nstaked out at low water to be fed upon alive by the sharks. Unfortunately, that \\nday is past. Nevertheless another ancient and honourable custom remains with \\nus. You all know what it is. When a man is a proven thief and liar he shall be \\nstruck with a dead pig.\" \\n \\nHis right hand went into the basket, and, despite the lack of his spectacles, the \\ndead pig that came into view landed accurately on Deasy\\'s neck. With such force \\nwas it thrown that the Chancellor, in his sitting position, toppled over sidewise. \\nBefore he could recover, Sepeli, with an agility unexpected of a woman who \\nweighed two hundred and sixty pounds, had sprung across to him. One hand \\nclutched his shirt collar, the other hand brandished the pig, and amid the vast \\nuproar of a delighted kingdom she royally swatted him. \\n \\nThere remained nothing for Tui Tulifau but to put a good face on his favourite\\'s \\ndisgrace, and his mountainous fat lay back on the mats and shook in a gale of \\nGargantuan laughter. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n127 \\n \\nWhen Sepeli dropped both pig and Chancellor, a talking man from the windward \\ncoast picked up the carcass. Cornelius was on his feet and running, when the pig \\ncaught him on the legs and tripped him. The people and the army, with shouts \\nand laughter, joined in the sport. \\n \\nTwist and dodge as he would, everywhere the ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer was \\nmet or overtaken by the flying pig. He scuttled like a frightened rabbit in and out \\namong the avocados and the palms. No hand was laid upon him, and his \\ntormentors made way before him, but ever they pursued, and ever the pig flew as \\nfast as hands could pick it up. \\n \\nAs the chase died away down the Broom Road, Grief led the traders to the royal \\ntreasury, and the day was well over ere the last Fitu-Ivan bank note had been \\nredeemed with coin. \\n \\nVII \\n \\nThrough the mellow cool of twilight a man paddled out from a clump of jungle to \\nthe Cantani. It was a leaky and abandoned dugout, and he paddled slowly, \\ndesisting from time to time in order to bale.

He was bedraggled \\nand filthy, and seemed half-dazed. \\n \\n\"Could I speak a word with you, Mr. Grief?\" he asked sadly and humbly. \\n \\n\"Sit to leeward and farther away,\" Grief answered. \"A little farther away. That\\'s \\nbetter.\" \\n \\nCornelius sat down on the rail and held his head in both his hands. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis right,\" he said. \"I\\'m as fragrant as a recent battlefield. My head aches to \\nburstin\\'. My neck is fair broken. The teeth are loose in my jaws. There\\'s nests of \\nhornets buzzin\\' in my ears. My medulla oblongata is dislocated. I\\'ve been through \\nearthquake and pestilence, and the heavens have rained pigs.\" He paused with a \\nsigh that ended in a groan. \"\\'Tis a vision of terrible death. One that the poets \\nnever dreamed. To be eaten by rats, or boiled in oil, or pulled apart by wild \\nhorses--that would be unpleasant. But to be beaten to death with a dead pig!\" He \\nshuddered at the awfulness of it. \"Sure it transcends the human imagination.\" \\n \\nCaptain Boig sniffed audibly, moved his canvas chair farther to windward, and \\nsat down again. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n128 \\n\"I hear you\\'re runnin\\' over to Yap, Mr. Grief,\" Cornelius went on. \"An\\' two things \\nI\\'m wantin\\' to beg of you: a passage an\\' the nip of the old smoky I refused the \\nnight you landed.\" \\n \\nGrief clapped his hands for the black steward and ordered soap and towels. \\n \\n\"Go for\\'ard, Cornelius, and take a scrub first,\" he said. \"The boy will bring you a \\npair of dungarees and a shirt. And by the way, before you go, how was it we \\nfound more coin in the treasury than paper you had issued?\" \\n \\n\"\\'Twas the stake of my own I\\'d brought with me for the adventure.\" \\n \\n\"We\\'ve decided to charge the demurrage and other expenses and loss to Tui \\nTulifau,\" Grief said. \"So the balance we found will be turned over to you.

The sum of ten shillings for that pig is \\nentered in the accounts.\" \\n \\nCornelius bowed his assent with a shudder. \\n \\n\"Sure it\\'s grateful I am it wasn\\'t a fifteen-shilling pig or a twenty-shilling one.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n129 \\n \\nChapter Eight--THE PEARLS OF PARLAY \\n \\n I \\n \\nThe Kanaka helmsman put the wheel down, and the Malahini slipped into the eye \\nof the wind and righted to an even keel. Her head-sails emptied, there was a rat-\\ntat of reef-points and quick shifting of boom-tackles, and she was heeled over and \\nfilled away on the other tack. Though it was early morning and the wind brisk, \\nthe five white men who lounged on the poop-deck were scantily clad. David Grief, \\nand his guest, Gregory Mulhall, an Englishman, were still in pajamas, their \\nnaked feet thrust into Chinese slippers. The captain and mate were in thin \\nundershirts and unstarched duck pants, while the supercargo still held in his \\nhands the undershirt he was reluctant to put on. The sweat stood out on his \\nforehead, and he seemed to thrust his bare chest thirstily into the wind that did \\nnot cool. \\n \\n\"Pretty muggy, for a breeze like this,\" he complained. \\n \\n\"And what\\'s it doing around in the west? That\\'s what I want to know,\" was Grief\\'s \\ncontribution to the general plaint. \\n \\n\"It won\\'t last, and it ain\\'t been there long,\" said Hermann, the Holland mate. \"She \\nis been chop around all night--five minutes here, ten minutes there, one hour \\nsomewhere other quarter.\" \\n \\n\"Something makin \\', something makin \\',\" Captain Warfield croaked, spreading his \\nbushy beard with the fingers of both hands and shoving the thatch of his chin \\ninto the breeze in a vain search for coolness. \"Weather\\'s been crazy for a \\nfortnight. Haven\\'t had the proper trades in three weeks. Everything\\'s mixed up. \\nBarometer was pumping at sunset last night, and it\\'s pumping now, though the \\nweather sharps say it don\\'t mean anything. All the same, I\\'ve got a prejudice \\nagainst seeing it pump. Gets on my nerves, sort of, you know. She was pumping \\nthat way the time we lost the Lancaster. I was only an apprentice, but I can \\nremember that well enough. Brand new, four-masted steel ship; first voyage; \\nbroke the old man\\'s heart. He\\'d been forty years in the company. Just faded way \\nand died the next year.\" \\n \\nDespite the wind and the early hour, the heat was suffocating. The wind \\nwhispered coolness, but did not deliver coolness. It might have blown off the \\nSahara, save for the extreme humidity with which it was laden. There was no fog \\nnor mist, nor hint of fog or mist, yet the dimness of distance produced the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n130 \\nimpression. There were no defined clouds, yet so thickly were the heavens \\ncovered by a messy cloud-pall that the sun failed to shine through. \\n \\n\"Ready about!\" Captain Warfield ordered with slow sharpness. \\n \\nThe brown, breech-clouted Kanaka sailors moved languidly but quickly to head-\\nsheets and boom-tackles. \\n \\n\"Hard a-lee!\" \\n \\nThe helmsman ran the spokes over with no hint of gentling, and the Malahini \\ndarted prettily into the wind and about. \\n \\n\"Jove! she\\'s a witch!\" was Mulhall\\'s appreciation. \"I didn\\'t know you South Sea \\ntraders sailed yachts.\" \\n \\n\"She was a Gloucester fisherman originally,\" Grief explained, \"and the Gloucester \\nboats are all yachts when it comes to build, rig, and sailing.\" \\n \\n\"But you\\'re heading right in--why don\\'t you make it?\" came the Englishman\\'s \\ncriticism. \\n \\n\"Try it, Captain Warfield,\" Grief suggested. \"Show him what a lagoon entrance is \\non a strong ebb.\" \\n \\n\"Close-and-by!\" the captain ordered. \\n \\n\"Close-and-by,\" the Kanaka repeated, easing half a spoke. \\n \\nThe Malahini laid squarely into the narrow passage which was the lagoon \\nentrance of a large, long, and narrow oval of an atoll. The atoll was shaped as if \\nthree atolls, in the course of building, had collided and coalesced and failed to \\nrear the partition walls. Cocoanut palms grew in spots on the circle of sand, and \\nthere were many gaps where the sand was too low to the sea for cocoanuts, and \\nthrough which could be seen the protected lagoon where the water lay flat like the \\nruffled surface of a mirror. Many square miles of water were in the irregular \\nlagoon, all of which surged out on the ebb through the one narrow channel. So \\nnarrow was the channel, so large the outflow of water, that the passage was more \\nlike the rapids of a river than the mere tidal entrance to an atoll. The water boiled \\nand whirled and swirled and drove outward in a white foam of stiff, serrated \\nwaves. Each heave and blow on her bows of the upstanding waves of the current \\nswung the Malahini off the straight lead and wedged her as with wedges of steel \\ntoward the side of the passage. Part way in she was, when her closeness to the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n131 \\ncoral edge compelled her to go about. On the opposite tack, broadside to the \\ncurrent, she swept seaward with the current\\'s speed. \\n \\n\"Now\\'s the time for that new and expensive engine of yours,\" Grief jeered good-\\nnaturedly. \\n \\nThat the engine was a sore point with Captain Warfield was patent. He had \\nbegged and badgered for it, until in the end Grief had given his consent. \\n \\n\"It will pay for itself yet,\" the captain retorted, \"You wait and see. It beats \\ninsurance and you know the underwriters won\\'t stand for insurance in the \\nPaumotus.\" \\n \\nGrief pointed to a small cutter beating up astern of them on the same course. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll wager a five-franc piece the little Nuhiva beats us in.\" \\n \\n\"Sure,\" Captain Warfield agreed. \"She\\'s overpowered. We\\'re like a liner alongside \\nof her, and we\\'ve only got forty horsepower. She\\'s got ten horse, and she\\'s a little \\nskimming dish. She could skate across the froth of hell, but just the same she \\ncan\\'t buck this current. It\\'s running ten knots right now.\" \\n \\nAnd at the rate of ten knots, buffeted and jerkily rolled, the Malahini went out to \\nsea with the tide. \\n \\n\"She\\'ll slacken in half an hour--then we\\'ll make headway,\" Captain Warfield said, \\nwith an irritation explained by his next words. \"He has no right to call it Parlay. \\nIt\\'s down on the admiralty charts, and the French charts, too, as Hikihoho. \\nBougainville discovered it and named it from the natives.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s the name matter?\" the supercargo demanded, taking advantage of speech \\nto pause with arms shoved into the sleeves of the undershirt. \"There it is, right \\nunder our nose, and old Parlay is there with the pearls.\" \\n \\n\"Who see them pearl?\" Hermann queried, looking from one to another. \\n \\n\"It\\'s well known,\" was the supercargo\\'s reply. He turned to the steersman: \"Tai-\\nHotauri, what about old Parlay\\'s pearls?\" \\n \\nThe Kanaka, pleased and self-conscious, took and gave a spoke. \\n \\n\"My brother dive for Parlay three, four month, and he make much talk about \\npearl. Hikihoho very good place for pearl.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n132 \\n \\n\"And the pearl-buyers have never got him to part with a pearl,\" the captain broke \\nin. \\n \\n\"And they say he had a hatful for Armande when he sailed for Tahiti,\" the \\nsupercargo carried on the tale. \"That\\'s fifteen years ago, and he\\'s been adding to \\nit ever since--stored the shell as well. Everybody\\'s seen that--hundreds of tons of \\nit. They say the lagoon\\'s fished clean now. Maybe that\\'s why he\\'s announced the \\nauction.\" \\n \\n\"If he really sells, this will be the biggest year\\'s output of pearls in the Paumotus,\" \\nGrief said. \\n \\n\"I say, now, look here!\" Mulhall burst forth, harried by the humid heat as much \\nas the rest of them. \"What\\'s it all about? Who\\'s the old beachcomber anyway? \\nWhat are all these pearls? Why so secretious about it?\" \\n \\n\"Hikihoho belongs to old Parlay,\" the supercargo answered. \"He\\'s got a fortune in \\npearls, saved up for years and years, and he sent the word out weeks ago that \\nhe\\'d auction them off to the buyers to-morrow. See those schooners\\' masts \\nsticking up inside the lagoon?\" \\n \\n\"Eight, so I see,\" said Hermann. \\n \\n\"What are they doing in a dinky atoll like this?\" the supercargo went on. \"There \\nisn\\'t a schooner-load of copra a year in the place. They\\'ve come for the auction. \\nThat\\'s why we\\'re here. That\\'s why the little Nuhiva\\'s bumping along astern there, \\nthough what she can buy is beyond me. Narii Herring--he\\'s an English Jew half-\\ncaste--owns and runs her, and his only assets are his nerve, his debts, and his \\nwhiskey bills. He\\'s a genius in such things. He owes so much that there isn\\'t a \\nmerchant in Papeete who isn\\'t interested in his welfare. They go out of their way \\nto throw work in his way. They\\'ve got to, and a dandy stunt it is for Narii. Now I \\nowe nobody. What\\'s the result? If I fell down in a fit on the beach they\\'d let me lie \\nthere and die. They wouldn\\'t lose anything. But Narii Herring?--what wouldn\\'t \\nthey do if he fell in a fit? Their best wouldn\\'t be too good for him. They\\'ve got too \\nmuch money tied up in him to let him lie. They\\'d take him into their homes and \\nhand-nurse him like a brother. Let me tell you, honesty in paying bills ain\\'t what \\nit\\'s cracked up to be.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s this Narii chap got to do with it?\" was the Englishman\\'s short-tempered \\ndemand. And, turning to Grief, he said, \"What\\'s all this pearl nonsense? Begin at \\nthe beginning.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n133 \\n\"You\\'ll have to help me out,\" Grief warned the others, as he began. \"Old Parlay is \\na character. From what I\\'ve seen of him I believe he\\'s partly and mildly insane. \\nAnyway, here\\'s the story: Parlay\\'s a full-blooded Frenchman. He told me once that \\nhe came from Paris. His accent is the true Parisian. He arrived down here in the \\nold days. Went to trading and all the rest. That\\'s how he got in on Hikihoho. \\nCame in trading when trading was the real thing. About a hundred miserable \\nPaumotans lived on the island. He married the queen--native fashion. When she \\ndied, everything was his. Measles came through, and there weren\\'t more than a \\ndozen survivors. He fed them, and worked them, and was king. Now before the \\nqueen died she gave birth to a girl. That\\'s Armande. When she was three he sent \\nher to the convent at Papeete. When she was seven or eight he sent her to France. \\nYou begin to glimpse the situation. The best and most aristocratic convent in \\nFrance was none too good for the only daughter of a Paumotan island king and \\ncapitalist, and you know the old country French draw no colour line. She was \\neducated like a princess, and she accepted herself in much the same way. Also, \\nshe thought she was all-white, and never dreamed of a bar sinister. \\n \\n\"Now comes the tragedy. The old man had always been cranky and erratic, and \\nhe\\'d played the despot on Hikihoho so long that he\\'d got the idea in his head that \\nthere was nothing wrong with the king--or the princess either. When Armande \\nwas eighteen he sent for her. He had slews and slathers of money, as Yankee Bill \\nwould say. He\\'d built the big house on Hikihoho, and a whacking fine bungalow \\nin Papeete. She was to arrive on the mail boat from New Zealand, and he sailed in \\nhis schooner to meet her at Papeete. And he might have carried the situation off, \\ndespite the hens and bull-beasts of Papeete, if it hadn\\'t been for the hurricane. \\nThat was the year, wasn\\'t it, when Manu-Huhi was swept and eleven hundred \\ndrowned?\" \\n \\nThe others nodded, and Captain Warfield said: \"I was in the Magpie that blow, \\nand we went ashore, all hands and the cook, Magpie and all, a quarter of a mile \\ninto the cocoanuts at the head of Taiohae Bay--and it a supposedly hurricane-\\nproof harbour.\" \\n \\n\"Well,\" Grief continued, \"old Parlay got caught in the same blow, and arrived in \\nPapeete with his hatful of pearls three weeks too late. He\\'d had to jack up his \\nschooner and build half a mile of ways before he could get her back into the sea. \\n \\n\"And in the meantime there was Armande at Papeete. Nobody called on her. She \\ndid, French fashion, make the initial calls on the Governor and the port doctor. \\nThey saw her, but neither of their hen-wives was at home to her nor returned the \\ncall. She was out of caste, without caste, though she had never dreamed it, and \\nthat was the gentle way they broke the information to her. There was a gay young \\nlieutenant on the French cruiser. He lost his heart to her, but not his head. You \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n134 \\ncan imagine the shock to this young woman, refined, beautiful, raised like an \\naristocrat, pampered with the best of old France that money could buy. And you \\ncan guess the end.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"There was a Japanese servant in \\nthe bungalow. He saw it. Said she did it with the proper spirit of the Samurai. \\nTook a stiletto--no thrust, no drive, no wild rush for annihilation--took the \\nstiletto, placed the point carefully against her heart, and with both hands, slowly \\nand steadily, pressed home. \\n \\n\"Old Parlay arrived after that with his pearls. There was one single one of them, \\nthey say, worth sixty thousand francs. Peter Gee saw it, and has told me he \\noffered that much for it. The old man went clean off for a while. They had him \\nstrait-jacketed in the Colonial Club two days----\" \\n \\n\"His wife\\'s uncle, an old Paumotan, cut him out of the jacket and turned him \\nloose,\" the supercargo corroborated. \\n \\n\"And then old Parlay proceeded to eat things up,\" Grief went on. \"Pumped three \\nbullets into the scalawag of a lieutenant----\" \\n \\n\"Who lay in sick bay for three months,\" Captain Warfield contributed. \\n \\n\"Flung a glass of wine in the Governor\\'s face; fought a duel with the port doctor; \\nbeat up his native servants; wrecked the hospital; broke two ribs and the \\ncollarbone of a man nurse, and escaped; and went down to his schooner, a gun in \\neach hand, daring the chief of police and all the gendarmes to arrest him, and \\nsailed for Hikihoho. And they say he\\'s never left the island since.\" \\n \\nThe supercargo nodded. \"That was fifteen years ago, and he\\'s never budged.\" \\n \\n\"And added to his pearls,\" said the captain. \"He\\'s a blithering old lunatic. Makes \\nmy flesh creep. He\\'s a regular Finn.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s that?\" Mulhall inquired. \\n \\n\"Bosses the weather--that\\'s what the natives believe, at any rate. Ask Tai-Hotauri \\nthere. Hey, Tai-Hotauri! what you think old Parlay do along weather?\" \\n \\n\"Just the same one big weather devil,\" came the Kanaka\\'s answer. \"I know. He \\nwant big blow, he make big blow. He want no wind, no wind come.\" \\n \\n\"A regular old Warlock,\" said Mulhall. \\n \\n\"No good luck them pearl,\" Tai-Hotauri blurted out, rolling his head ominously. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n135 \\n\"He say he sell. Plenty schooner come. Then he make big hurricane, everybody \\nfinish, you see. All native men say so.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s hurricane season now,\" Captain War-field laughed morosely. \"They\\'re not far \\nwrong. It\\'s making for something right now, and I\\'d feel better if the Malahini was \\na thousand miles away from here.\" \\n \\n\"He is a bit mad,\" Grief concluded. \"I\\'ve tried to get his point of view. It\\'s--well, it\\'s \\nmixed. For eighteen years he\\'d centred everything on Armande. Half the time he \\nbelieves she\\'s still alive, not yet come back from France. That\\'s one of the reasons \\nhe held on to the pearls. And all the time he hates white men. He never forgets \\nthey killed her, though a great deal of the time he forgets she\\'s dead. Hello! \\nWhere\\'s your wind?\" \\n \\nThe sails bellied emptily overhead, and Captain Warfield grunted his disgust. \\nIntolerable as the heat had been, in the absence of wind it was almost \\noverpowering. The sweat oozed out on all their faces, and now one, and again \\nanother, drew deep breaths, involuntarily questing for more air. \\n \\n\"Here she comes again--an eight point haul! Boom-tackles across! Jump!\" \\n \\nThe Kanakas sprang to the captain\\'s orders, and for five minutes the schooner \\nlaid directly into the passage and even gained on the current. Again the breeze fell \\nflat, then puffed from the old quarter, compelling a shift back of sheets and \\ntackles. \\n \\n\"Here comes the Nuhiva\" Grief said. \"She\\'s got her engine on. Look at her skim.\" \\n \\n\"All ready?\" the captain asked the engineer, a Portuguese half-caste, whose head \\nand shoulders protruded from the small hatch just for\\'ard of the cabin, and who \\nwiped the sweat from his face with a bunch of greasy waste. \\n \\n\"Sure,\" he replied. \\n \\n\"Then let her go.\" \\n \\nThe engineer disappeared into his den, and a moment later the exhaust muffler \\ncoughed and spluttered overside. But the schooner could not hold her lead. The \\nlittle cutter made three feet to her two and was quickly alongside and forging \\nahead. Only natives were on her deck, and the man steering waved his hand in \\nderisive greeting and farewell. \\n \\n\"That\\'s Narii Herring,\" Grief told Mulhall. \"The big fellow at the wheel--the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n136 \\nnerviest and most conscienceless scoundrel in the Paumotus.\" \\n \\nFive minutes later a cry of joy from their own Kanakas centred all eyes on the \\nNuhiva. Her engine had broken down and they were overtaking her. The \\nMalahini\\'s sailors sprang into the rigging and jeered as they went by; the little \\ncutter heeled over by the wind with a bone in her teeth, going backward on the \\ntide. \\n \\n\"Some engine that of ours,\" Grief approved, as the lagoon opened before them and \\nthe course was changed across it to the anchorage. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield was visibly cheered, though he merely grunted, \"It\\'ll pay for \\nitself, never fear.\" \\n \\nThe Malahini ran well into the centre of the little fleet ere she found swinging \\nroom to anchor. \\n \\n\"There\\'s Isaacs on the Dolly,\" Grief observed, with a hand wave of greeting. \"And \\nPeter Gee\\'s on the Roberta. Couldn\\'t keep him away from a pearl sale like this. \\nAnd there\\'s Francini on the Cactus. They\\'re all here, all the buyers. Old Parlay \\nwill surely get a price.\" \\n \\n\"They haven\\'t repaired the engine yet,\" Captain Warfield grumbled gleefully. \\n \\nHe was looking across the lagoon to where the Nuhiva\\'s sails showed through the \\nsparse cocoa-nuts. \\n \\nII \\n \\nThe house of Parlay was a big two-story frame affair, built of California lumber, \\nwith a galvanized iron roof. So disproportionate was it to the slender ring of the \\natoll that it showed out upon the sand-strip and above it like some monstrous \\nexcrescence. They of the Malahini paid the courtesy visit ashore immediately after \\nanchoring. Other captains and buyers were in the big room examining the pearls \\nthat were to be auctioned next day. Paumotan servants, natives of Hikihoho, and \\nrelatives of the owner, moved about dispensing whiskey and absinthe. And \\nthrough the curious company moved Parlay himself, cackling and sneering, the \\nwithered wreck of what had once been a tall and powerful man. His eyes were \\ndeep sunken and feverish, his cheeks fallen in and cavernous. The hair of his \\nhead seemed to have come out in patches, and his mustache and imperial had \\nshed in the same lopsided way. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n137 \\n\"Jove!\" Mulhall muttered under his breath. \"A long-legged Napoleon the Third, \\nbut burnt out, baked, and fire-crackled. And mangy! No wonder he crooks his \\nhead to one side. He\\'s got to keep the balance.\" \\n \\n\"Goin\\' to have a blow,\" was the old man\\'s greeting to Grief. \"You must think a lot \\nof pearls to come a day like this.\" \\n \\n\"They\\'re worth going to inferno for,\" Grief laughed genially back, running his eyes \\nover the surface of the table covered by the display. \\n \\n\"Other men have already made that journey for them,\" old Parlay cackled. \"See \\nthis one!\" He pointed to a large, perfect pearl the size of a small walnut that lay \\napart on a piece of chamois. \"They offered me sixty thousand francs for it in \\nTahiti. They\\'ll bid as much and more for it to-morrow, if they aren\\'t blown away. \\nWell, that pearl, it was found by my cousin, my cousin by marriage. He was a \\nnative, you see. Also, he was a thief. He hid it. It was mine. His cousin, who was \\nalso my cousin--we\\'re all related here--killed him for it and fled away in a cutter \\nto Noo-Nau. I pursued, but the chief of Noo-Nau had killed him for it before I got \\nthere. Oh, yes, there are many dead men represented on the table there. Have a \\ndrink, Captain. Your face is not familiar. You are new in the islands?\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s Captain Robinson of the Roberta,\" Grief said, introducing them. \\n \\nIn the meantime Mulhall had shaken hands with Peter Gee. \\n \\n\"I never fancied there were so many pearls in the world,\" Mulhall said. \\n \\n\"Nor have I ever seen so many together at one time,\" Peter Gee admitted. \\n \\n\"What ought they to be worth?\" \\n \\n\"Fifty or sixty thousand pounds--and that\\'s to us buyers. In Paris----\" He \\nshrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows at the incommunicableness of the \\nsum. \\n \\nMulhall wiped the sweat from his eyes. All were sweating profusely and breathing \\nhard. There was no ice in the drink that was served, and whiskey and absinthe \\nwent down lukewarm. \\n \\n\"Yes, yes,\" Parlay was cackling. \"Many dead men lie on the table there. I know \\nthose pearls, all of them. You see those three! Perfectly matched, aren\\'t they? A \\ndiver from Easter Island got them for me inside a week. Next week a shark got \\nhim; took his arm off and blood poison did the business. And that big baroque \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n138 \\nthere--nothing much--if I\\'m offered twenty francs for it to-morrow I\\'ll be in luck; it \\ncame out of twenty-two fathoms of water. The man was from Raratonga. He broke \\nall diving records. He got it out of twenty-two fathoms. I saw him. And he burst \\nhis lungs at the same time, or got the \\'bends,\\' for he died in two hours. He died \\nscreaming. They could hear him for miles. He was the most powerful native I ever \\nsaw. Half a dozen of my divers have died of the bends. And more men will die, \\nmore men will die.\" \\n \\n\"Oh, hush your croaking, Parlay,\" chided one of the captains. \"It ain\\'t going to \\nblow.\" \\n \\n\"If I was a strong man, I couldn\\'t get up hook and get out fast enough,\" the old \\nman retorted in the falsetto of age. \"Not if I was a strong man with the taste for \\nwine yet in my mouth. But not you. You\\'ll all stay, I wouldn\\'t advise you if I \\nthought you\\'d go, You can\\'t drive buzzards away from the carrion. Have another \\ndrink, my brave sailor-men. Well, well, what men will dare for a few little oyster \\ndrops! There they are, the beauties! Auction to-morrow, at ten sharp. Old Parlay\\'s \\nselling out, and the buzzards are gathering--old Parlay who was a stronger man \\nin his day than any of them and who will see most of them dead yet.\" \\n \\n\"If he isn\\'t a vile old beast!\" the supercargo of the Malahini whispered to Peter \\nGee. \\n \\n\"What if she does blow?\" said the captain of the Dolly. \"Hikihoho\\'s never been \\nswept.\" \\n \\n\"The more reason she will be, then,\" Captain Warfield answered back. \"I wouldn\\'t \\ntrust her.\" \\n \\n\"Who\\'s croaking now?\" Grief reproved. \\n \\n\"I\\'d hate to lose that new engine before it paid for itself,\" Captain Warfield replied \\ngloomily. \\n \\nParlay skipped with astonishing nimbleness across the crowded room to the \\nbarometer on the wall. \\n \\n\"Take a look, my brave sailormen!\" he cried exultantly. \\n \\nThe man nearest read the glass. The sobering effect showed plainly on his face. \\n \\n\"It\\'s dropped ten,\" was all he said, yet every face went anxious, and there was a \\nlook as if every man desired immediately to start for the door. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n139 \\n \\n\"Listen!\" Parlay commanded. \\n \\nIn the silence the outer surf seemed to have become unusually loud. There was a \\ngreat rumbling roar. \\n \\n\"A big sea is beginning to set,\" some one said; and there was a movement to the \\nwindows, where all gathered. \\n \\nThrough the sparse cocoanuts they gazed seaward. An orderly succession of huge \\nsmooth seas was rolling down upon the coral shore. For some minutes they gazed \\non the strange sight and talked in low voices, and in those few minutes it was \\nmanifest to all that the waves were increasing in size. It was uncanny, this rising \\nsea in a dead calm, and their voices unconsciously sank lower. Old Parlay \\nshocked them with his abrupt cackle. \\n \\n\"There is yet time to get away to sea, brave gentlemen. You can tow across the \\nlagoon with your whaleboats.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s all right, old man,\" said Darling, the mate of the Cactus, a stalwart youngster \\nof twenty-five. \"The blow\\'s to the southward and passing on. We\\'ll not get a whiff \\nof it.\" \\n \\nAn air of relief went through the room. Conversations were started, and the voices \\nbecame louder. Several of the buyers even went back to the table to continue the \\nexamination of the pearls. \\n \\nParlay\\'s shrill cackle rose higher. \\n \\n\"That\\'s right,\" he encouraged. \"If the world was coming to an end you\\'d go on \\nbuying.\" \\n \\n\"We\\'ll buy these to-morrow just the same,\" Isaacs assured him. \\n \\n\"Then you\\'ll be doing your buying in hell.\" \\n \\nThe chorus of incredulous laughter incensed the old man. He turned fiercely on \\nDarling. \\n \\n\"Since when have children like you come to the knowledge of storms? And who is \\nthe man who has plotted the hurricane-courses of the Paumotus? What books \\nwill you find it in? I sailed the Paumotus before the oldest of you drew breath. I \\nknow. To the eastward the paths of the hurricanes are on so wide a circle they \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n140 \\nmake a straight line. To the westward here they make a sharp curve. Remember \\nyour chart. How did it happen the hurricane of \\'91 swept Auri and Hiolau? The \\ncurve, my brave boy, the curve! In an hour, or two or three at most, will come the \\nwind. Listen to that!\" \\n \\nA vast rumbling crash shook the coral foundations of the atoll. The house \\nquivered to it. The native servants, with bottles of whiskey and absinthe in their \\nhands, shrank together as if for protection and stared with fear through the \\nwindows at the mighty wash of the wave lapping far up the beach to the corner of \\na copra-shed. \\n \\nParlay looked at the barometer, giggled, and leered around at his guests. Captain \\nWar-field strode across to see. \\n \\n\"29:75,\" he read. \"She\\'s gone down five more. By God! the old devil\\'s right. She\\'s \\na-coming, and it\\'s me, for one, for aboard.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s growing dark,\" Isaacs half whispered. \\n \\n\"Jove! it\\'s like a stage,\" Mulhall said to Grief, looking at his watch. \"Ten o\\'clock in \\nthe morning, and it\\'s like twilight. Down go the lights for the tragedy. Where\\'s the \\nslow music!\" \\n \\nIn answer, another rumbling crash shook the atoll and the house. Almost in a \\npanic the company started for the door. In the dim light their sweaty faces \\nappeared ghastly. Isaacs panted asthmatically in the suffocating heat. \\n \\n\"What\\'s your haste?\" Parlay chuckled and girded at his departing guests. \"A last \\ndrink, brave gentlemen.\" No one noticed him. As they took the shell-bordered \\npath to the beach he stuck his head out the door and called, \"Don\\'t forget, \\ngentlemen, at ten to-morrow old Parlay sells his pearls.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nOn the beach a curious scene took place. Whaleboat after whaleboat was being \\nhurriedly manned and shoved off. It had grown still darker. The stagnant calm \\ncontinued, and the sand shook under their feet with each buffet of the sea on the \\nouter shore. Narii Herring walked leisurely along the sand. He grinned at the very \\nevident haste of the captains and buyers. With him were three of his Kanakas, \\nand also Tai-Hotauri. \\n \\n\"Get into the boat and take an oar,\" Captain Warfield ordered the latter. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n141 \\nTai-Hotauri came over jauntily, while Narii Herring and his three Kanakas paused \\nand looked on from forty feet away. \\n \\n\"I work no more for you, skipper,\" Tai-Hotauri said insolently and loudly. But his \\nface belied his words, for he was guilty of a prodigious wink. \"Fire me, skipper,\" \\nhe huskily whispered, with a second significant wink. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield took the cue and proceeded to do some acting himself. He raised \\nhis fist and his voice. \\n \\n\"Get into that boat,\" he thundered, \"or I\\'ll knock seven bells out of you!\" \\n \\nThe Kanaka drew back truculently, and Grief stepped between to placate his \\ncaptain. \\n \\n\"I go to work on the Nuhiva,\" Tai-Hotauri said, rejoining the other group. \\n \\n\"Come back here!\" the captain threatened. \\n \\n\"He\\'s a free man, skipper,\" Narii Herring spoke up. \"He\\'s sailed with me in the \\npast, and he\\'s sailing again, that\\'s all.\" \\n \\n\"Come on, we must get on board,\" Grief urged. \"Look how dark it\\'s getting.\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield gave in, but as the boat shoved off he stood up in the \\nsternsheets and shook his fist ashore. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll settle with you yet, Narii,\" he cried. \"You\\'re the only skipper in the group that \\nsteals other men\\'s sailors,\" He sat down, and in lowered voice queried: \"Now \\nwhat\\'s Tai-Hotauri up to? He\\'s on to something, but what is it?\" \\n \\nIV \\n \\nAs the boat came alongside the Malahini, Hermann\\'s anxious face greeted them \\nover the rail. \\n \\n\"Bottom out fall from barometer,\" he announced. \"She\\'s goin\\' to blow. I got \\nstarboard anchor overhaul.\" \\n \\n\"Overhaul the big one, too,\" Captain Warfield ordered, taking charge. \"And here, \\nsome of you, hoist in this boat. Lower her down to the deck and lash her bottom \\nup.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n142 \\nMen were busy at work on the decks of all the schooners. There was a great \\nclanking of chains being overhauled, and now one craft, and now another, hove \\nin, veered, and dropped a second anchor. Like the Malahini, those that had third \\nanchors were preparing to drop them when the wind showed what quarter it was \\nto blow from. \\n \\nThe roar of the big surf continually grew though the lagoon lay in the mirror-like \\ncalm. \\n \\nThere was no sign of life where Parlay\\'s big house perched on the sand. Boat and \\ncopra-sheds and the sheds where the shell was stored were deserted. \\n \\n\"For two cents I\\'d up anchors and get out,\" Grief said. \"I\\'d do it anyway if it were \\nopen sea. But those chains of atolls to the north and east have us pocketed. \\nWe\\'ve a better chance right here. What do you think, Captain Warfield?\" \\n \\n\"I agree with you, though a lagoon is no mill-pond for riding it out. I wonder \\nwhere she\\'s going to start from? Hello! There goes one of Parlay\\'s copra-sheds.\" \\n \\nThey could see the grass-thatched shed lift and collapse, while a froth of foam \\ncleared the crest of the sand and ran down to the lagoon. \\n \\n\"Breached across!\" Mulhall exclaimed. \"That\\'s something for a starter. There she \\ncomes again!\" \\n \\nThe wreck of the shed was now flung up and left on the sand-crest, A third wave \\nbuffeted it into fragments which washed down the slope toward the lagoon. \\n \\n\"If she blow I would as be cooler yet,\" Hermann grunted. \"No longer can I breathe. \\nIt is damn hot. I am dry like a stove.\" \\n \\nHe chopped open a drinking cocoanut with his heavy sheath-knife and drained \\nthe contents. The rest of them followed his example, pausing once to watch one of \\nParlay\\'s shell sheds go down in ruin. The barometer now registered 29:50. \\n \\n\"Must be pretty close to the centre of the area of low pressure,\" Grief remarked \\ncheerfully. \"I was never through the eye of a hurricane before. It will be an \\nexperience for you, too, Mulhall. From the speed the barometer\\'s dropped, it\\'s \\ngoing to be a big one.\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield groaned, and all eyes drew to him. He was looking through the \\nglasses down the length of the lagoon to the southeast. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n143 \\n\"There she comes,\" he said quietly. \\n \\nThey did not need glasses to see. A flying film, strangely marked, seemed drawing \\nover the surface of the lagoon. Abreast of it, along the atoll, travelling with equal \\nspeed, was a stiff bending of the cocoanut palms and a blur of flying leaves. The \\nfront of the wind on the water was a solid, sharply defined strip of dark-coloured, \\nwind-vexed water. In advance of this strip, like skirmishers, were flashes of \\nwindflaws. Behind this strip, a quarter of a mile in width, was a strip of what \\nseemed glassy calm. Next came another dark strip of wind, and behind that the \\nlagoon was all crisping, boiling whiteness. \\n \\n\"What is that calm streak?\" Mulhall asked. \\n \\n\"Calm,\" Warfield answered. \\n \\n\"But it travels as fast as the wind,\" was the other\\'s objection. \\n \\n\"It has to, or it would be overtaken and it wouldn\\'t be any calm. It\\'s a double-\\nheader, I saw a big squall like that off Savaii once. A regular double-header. \\nSmash! it hit us, then it lulled to nothing, and smashed us a second time. Stand \\nby and hold on! Here she is on top of us. Look at the Roberta!\" \\n \\nThe Roberta, lying nearest to the wind at slack chains, was swept off broadside \\nlike a straw. Then her chains brought her up, bow on to the wind, with an \\nastonishing jerk. Schooner after schooner, the Malahini with them, was now \\nsweeping away with the first gust and fetching up on taut chains. Mulhall and \\nseveral of the Kanakas were taken off their feet when the Malahini jerked to her \\nanchors. \\n \\nAnd then there was no wind. The flying calm streak had reached them. Grief \\nlighted a match, and the unshielded flame burned without flickering in the still \\nair. A very dim twilight prevailed. The cloud-sky, lowering as it had been for \\nhours, seemed now to have descended quite down upon the sea. \\n \\nThe Roberta tightened to her chains when the second head of the hurricane hit, \\nas did schooner after schooner in swift succession. The sea, white with fury, \\nboiled in tiny, spitting wavelets. The deck of the Malahini vibrated under the \\nmen\\'s feet. The taut-stretched halyards beat a tattoo against the masts, and all \\nthe rigging, as if smote by some mighty hand, set up a wild thrumming. It was \\nimpossible to face the wind and breathe. Mulhall, crouching with the others \\nbehind the shelter of the cabin, discovered this, and his lungs were filled in an \\ninstant with so great a volume of driven air which he could not expel that he \\nnearly strangled ere he could turn his head away. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n144 \\n \\n\"It\\'s incredible,\" he gasped, but no one heard him. \\n \\nHermann and several Kanakas were crawling for\\'ard on hands and knees to let go \\nthe third anchor. Grief touched Captain Warfield and pointed to the Roberta. She \\nwas dragging down upon them. Warfield put his mouth to Grief\\'s ear and \\nshouted: \\n \\n\"We\\'re dragging, too!\" \\n \\nGrief sprang to the wheel and put it hard over, veering the Mahhini to port. The \\nthird anchor took hold, and the Roberta went by, stern-first, a dozen yards away. \\nThey waved their hands to Peter Gee and Captain Robinson, who, with a number \\nof sailors, were at work on the bow. \\n \\n\"He\\'s knocking out the shackles!\" Grief shouted. \"Going to chance the passage! \\nGot to! Anchors skating!\" \\n \\n\"We\\'re holding now!\" came the answering shout. \"There goes the Cactus down on \\nthe Misi. That settles them!\" \\n \\nThe Misi had been holding, but the added windage of the Cactus was too much, \\nand the entangled schooners slid away across the boiling white. Their men could \\nbe seen chopping and fighting to get them apart. The Roberta, cleared of her \\nanchors, with a patch of tarpaulin set for\\'ard, was heading for the passage at the \\nnorthwestern end of the lagoon. They saw her make it and drive out to sea. But \\nthe Misi and Cactus, unable to get clear of each other, went ashore on the atoll \\nhalf a mile from the passage. The wind merely increased on itself and continued \\nto increase. To face the full blast of it required all one\\'s strength, and several \\nminutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man to exhaustion. Hermann, with \\nhis Kanakas, plodded steadily, lashing and making secure, putting ever more \\ngaskets on the sails. The wind ripped and tore their thin undershirts from their \\nbacks. They moved slowly, as if their bodies weighed tons, never releasing a \\nhand-hold until another had been secured. Loose ends of rope stood out stiffly \\nhorizontal, and, when a whipping gave, the loose end frazzled and blew away. \\n \\nMulhall touched one and then another and pointed to the shore. The grass-sheds \\nhad disappeared, and Parlay\\'s house rocked drunkenly, Because the wind blew \\nlengthwise along the atoll, the house had been sheltered by the miles of cocoanut \\ntrees. But the big seas, breaking across from outside, were undermining it and \\nhammering it to pieces. Already tilted down the slope of sand, its end was \\nimminent. Here and there in the cocoanut trees people had lashed themselves. \\nThe trees did not sway or thresh about. Bent over rigidly from the wind, they \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n145 \\nremained in that position and vibrated monstrously. Underneath, across the \\nsand, surged the white spume of the breakers. A big sea was likewise making \\ndown the length of the lagoon. It had plenty of room to kick up in the ten-mile \\nstretch from the windward rim of the atoll, and all the schooners were bucking \\nand plunging into it. The Malahini had begun shoving her bow and fo\\'c\\'sle head \\nunder the bigger ones, and at times her waist was filled rail-high with water. \\n \\n\"Now\\'s the time for your engine!\" Grief bellowed; and Captain Warfield, crawling \\nover to where the engineer lay, shouted emphatic commands. \\n \\nUnder the engine, going full speed ahead, the Malahini behaved better. While she \\ncontinued to ship seas over her bow, she was not jerked down so fiercely by her \\nanchors. On the other hand, she was unable to get any slack in the chains. The \\nbest her forty horsepower could do was to ease the strain. \\n \\nStill the wind increased. The little Nuhiva, lying abreast of the Malahini and \\ncloser in to the beach, her engine still unrepaired and her captain ashore, was \\nhaving a bad time of it. She buried herself so frequently and so deeply that they \\nwondered each time if she could clear herself of the water. At three in the \\nafternoon buried by a second sea before she could free herself of the preceding \\none, she did not come up. \\n \\nMulhall looked at Grief. \\n \\n\"Burst in her hatches,\" was the bellowed answer. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield pointed to the Winifred, a little schooner plunging and burying \\noutside of them, and shouted in Grief\\'s ear. His voice came in patches of dim \\nwords, with intervals of silence when whisked away by the roaring wind. \\n \\n\"Rotten little tub... Anchors hold... But how she holds together... Old as the ark---\\n-\" \\n \\nAn hour later Hermann pointed to her. Her for\\'ard bitts, foremast, and most of \\nher bow were gone, having been jerked out of her by her anchors. She swung \\nbroadside, rolling in the trough and settling by the head, and in this plight was \\nswept away to leeward. \\n \\nFive vessels now remained, and of them the Malahini was the only one with an \\nengine. Fearing either the Nuhiva\\'s or the Winifdred\\'s fate, two of them followed \\nthe Roberta\\'s example, knocking out the chain-shackles and running for the \\npassage. The Dolly was the first, but her tarpaulin was carried away, and she \\nwent to destruction on the lee-rim of the atoll near the Misi and the Cactus. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n146 \\nUndeterred by this, the Moana let go and followed with the same result. \\n \\n\"Pretty good engine that, eh?\" Captain Warfield yelled to his owner. \\n \\nGrief put out his hand and shook. \"She\\'s paying for herself!\" he yelled back. \"The \\nwind\\'s shifting around to the southward, and we ought to lie easier!\" \\n \\nSlowly and steadily, but with ever-increasing velocity, the wind veered around to \\nthe south and the southwest, till the three schooners that were left pointed \\ndirectly in toward the beach. The wreck of Parlay\\'s house was picked up, hurled \\ninto the lagoon, and blown out upon them. Passing the Malahini, it crashed into \\nthe Papara, lying a quarter of a mile astern. There was wild work for\\'ard on her, \\nand in a quarter of an hour the house went clear, but it had taken the Papara\\'s \\nforemast and bowsprit with it. \\n \\nInshore, on their port bow, lay the Tahaa, slim and yacht-like, but excessively \\noversparred. Her anchors still held, but her captain, finding no abatement in the \\nwind, proceeded to reduce windage by chopping down his masts. \\n \\n\"Pretty good engine that,\" Grief congratulated his skipper, \"It will save our sticks \\nfor us yet.\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield shook his head dubiously. \\n \\nThe sea on the lagoon went swiftly down with the change of wind, but they were \\nbeginning to feel the heave and lift of the outer sea breaking across the atoll. \\nThere were not so many trees remaining. Some had been broken short off, others \\nuprooted. One tree they saw snap off halfway up, three persons clinging to it, and \\nwhirl away by the wind into the lagoon. Two detached themselves from it and \\nswam to the Tahaa. Not long after, just before darkness, they saw one jump \\noverboard from that schooner\\'s stern and strike out strongly for the Malahini \\nthrough the white, spitting wavelets. \\n \\n\"It\\'s Tai-Hotauri,\" was Grief\\'s judgment. \"Now we\\'ll have the news.\" \\n \\nThe Kanaka caught the bobstay, climbed over the bow, and crawled aft. Time was \\ngiven him to breathe, and then, behind the part shelter of the cabin, in broken \\nsnatches and largely by signs, he told his story. \\n \\n\"Narii... damn robber... He want steal... pearls... Kill Parlay... One man kill \\nParlay... No man know what man... Three Kanakas, Narii, me... Five beans... \\nhat... Narii say one bean black... Nobody know... Kill Parlay... Narii damn liar... \\nAll beans black... Five black... Copra-shed dark... Every man get black bean... Big \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n147 \\nwind come... No chance... Everybody get up tree... No good luck them pearls... I \\ntell you before... No good luck.\" \\n \\n\"Where\\'s Parlay?\" Grief shouted. \\n \\n\"Up tree... Three of his Kanakas same tree. Narii and one Kanaka\\'nother tree... \\nMy tree blow to hell, then I come on board.\" \\n \\n\"Where\\'s the pearls?\" \\n \\n\"Up tree along Parlay. Mebbe Narii get them pearl yet.\" \\n \\nIn the ear of one after another Grief passed on Tai-Hotauri\\'s story. Captain \\nWarfield was particularly incensed, and they could see him grinding his teeth. \\n \\nHermann went below and returned with a riding light, but the moment it was \\nlifted above the level of the cabin wall the wind blew it out. He had better success \\nwith the binnacle lamp, which was lighted only after many collective attempts. \\n \\n\"A fine night of wind!\" Grief yelled in Mulhall\\'s ear. \"And blowing harder all the \\ntime.\" \\n \\n\"How hard?\" \\n \\n\"A hundred miles an hour... two hundred... I don\\'t know... Harder than I\\'ve ever \\nseen it.\" \\n \\nThe lagoon grew more and more troubled by the sea that swept across the atoll. \\nHundreds of leagues of ocean was being backed up by the hurricane, which more \\nthan overcame the lowering effect of the ebb tide. Immediately the tide began to \\nrise the increase in the size of the seas was noticeable. Moon and wind were \\nheaping the South Pacific on Hikihoho atoll. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield returned from one of his periodical trips to the engine room with \\nthe word that the engineer lay in a faint. \\n \\n\"Can\\'t let that engine stop!\" he concluded helplessly. \\n \\n\"All right!\" Grief said, \"Bring him on deck. I\\'ll spell him.\" \\n \\nThe hatch to the engine room was battened down, access being gained through a \\nnarrow passage from the cabin. The heat and gas fumes were stifling. Grief took \\none hasty, comprehensive examination of the engine and the fittings of the tiny \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n148 \\nroom, then blew out the oil-lamp. After that he worked in darkness, save for the \\nglow from endless cigars which he went into the cabin to light. Even-tempered as \\nhe was, he soon began to give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a \\nmechanical monster that toiled, and sobbed, and slubbered in the shouting dark. \\nNaked to the waist, covered with grease and oil, bruised and skinned from being \\nknocked about by the plunging, jumping vessel, his head swimming from the \\nmixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe, he laboured on hour after \\nhour, in turns petting, blessing, nursing, and cursing the engine and all its parts. \\nThe ignition began to go bad. The feed grew worse. And worst of all, the cylinders \\nbegan to heat. In a consultation held in the cabin the half-caste engineer begged \\nand pleaded to stop the engine for half an hour in order to cool it and to attend to \\nthe water circulation. Captain Warfield was against any stopping. The half-caste \\nswore that the engine would ruin itself and stop anyway and for good. Grief, with \\nglaring eyes, greasy and battered, yelled and cursed them both down and issued \\ncommands. Mulhall, the supercargo, and Hermann were set to work in the cabin \\nat double-straining and triple-straining the gasoline. A hole was chopped through \\nthe engine room floor, and a Kanaka heaved bilge-water over the cylinders, while \\nGrief continued to souse running parts in oil. \\n \\n\"Didn\\'t know you were a gasoline expert,\" Captain Warfield admired when Grief \\ncame into the cabin to catch a breath of little less impure air. \\n \\n\"I bathe in gasoline,\" he grated savagely through his teeth. \"I eat it.\" \\n \\nWhat other uses he might have found for it were never given, for at that moment \\nall the men in the cabin, as well as the gasoline being strained, were smashed \\nforward against the bulkhead as the Malahini took an abrupt, deep dive. For the \\nspace of several minutes, unable to gain their feet, they rolled back and forth and \\npounded and hammered from wall to wall. The schooner, swept by three big seas, \\ncreaked and groaned and quivered, and from the weight of water on her decks \\nbehaved logily. Grief crept to the engine, while Captain Warfield waited his \\nchance to get through the companion-way and out on deck. \\n \\nIt was half an hour before he came back. \\n \\n\"Whaleboat\\'s gone!\" he reported. \"Galley\\'s gone! Everything gone except the deck \\nand hatches! And if that engine hadn\\'t been going we\\'d be gone! Keep up the good \\nwork!\" \\n \\nBy midnight the engineer\\'s lungs and head had been sufficiently cleared of gas \\nfumes to let him relieve Grief, who went on deck to get his own head and lungs \\nclear. He joined the others, who crouched behind the cabin, holding on with their \\nhands and made doubly secure by rope-lashings. It was a complicated huddle, for \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n149 \\nit was the only place of refuge for the Kanakas. Some of them had accepted the \\nskipper\\'s invitation into the cabin but had been driven out by the fumes. The \\nMalahini was being plunged down and swept frequently, and what they breathed \\nwas air and spray and water commingled. \\n \\n\"Making heavy weather of it, Mulhall!\" Grief shouted to his guest between \\nimmersions. \\n \\nMulhall, strangling and choking, could only nod. The scuppers could not carry off \\nthe burden of water on the schooner\\'s deck. She rolled it out and took it in over \\none rail and the other; and at times, nose thrown skyward, sitting down on her \\nheel, she avalanched it aft. It surged along the poop gangways, poured over the \\ntop of the cabin, submerging and bruising those that clung on, and went out over \\nthe stern-rail. \\n \\nMulhall saw him first, and drew Grief\\'s attention. It was Narii Herring, crouching \\nand holding on where the dim binnacle light shone upon him. He was quite \\nnaked, save for a belt and a bare-bladed knife thrust between it and the skin. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield untied his lashings and made his way over the bodies of the \\nothers. When his face became visible in the light from the binnacle it was working \\nwith anger. They could see him speak, but the wind tore the sound away. He \\nwould not put his lips to Narii\\'s ear. Instead, he pointed over the side. Narii \\nHerring understood. His white teeth showed in an amused and sneering smile, \\nand he stood up, a magnificent figure of a man. \\n \\n\"It\\'s murder!\" Mulhall yelled to Grief. \\n \\n\"He\\'d have murdered Old Parlay!\" Grief yelled back. \\n \\nFor the moment the poop was clear of water and the Malahini on an even keel. \\nNarii made a bravado attempt to walk to the rail, but was flung down by the \\nwind. Thereafter he crawled, disappearing in the darkness, though there was \\ncertitude in all of them that he had gone over the side. The Malahini dived deep, \\nand when they emerged from the flood that swept aft, Grief got Mulhall\\'s ear. \\n \\n\"Can\\'t lose him! He\\'s the Fish Man of Tahiti! He\\'ll cross the lagoon and land on \\nthe other rim of the atoll if there\\'s any atoll left!\" \\n \\nFive minutes afterward, in another submergence, a mess of bodies poured down \\non them over the top of the cabin. These they seized and held till the water \\ncleared, when they carried them below and learned their identity. Old Parlay lay \\noh his back on the floor, with closed eyes and without movement. The other two \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n150 \\nwere his Kanaka cousins. All three were naked and bloody. The arm of one \\nKanaka hung helpless and broken at his side. The other man bled freely from a \\nhideous scalp wound. \\n \\n\"Narii did that?\" Mulhall demanded. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"No; it\\'s from being smashed along the deck and over the \\nhouse!\" \\n \\nSomething suddenly ceased, leaving them in dizzying uncertainty. For the \\nmoment it was hard to realize there was no wind. With the absolute abruptness of \\na sword slash, the wind had been chopped off. The schooner rolled and plunged, \\nfetching up on her anchors with a crash which for the first time they could hear. \\nAlso, for the first time they could hear the water washing about on deck. The \\nengineer threw off the propeller and eased the engine down. \\n \\n\"We\\'re in the dead centre,\" Grief said. \"Now for the shift. It will come as hard as \\never.\" He looked at the barometer. \"29:32,\" he read. \\n \\nNot in a moment could he tone down the voice which for hours had battled \\nagainst the wind, and so loudly did he speak that in the quiet it hurt the others\\' \\nears. \\n \\n\"All his ribs are smashed,\" the supercargo said, feeling along Parlay\\'s side. \"He\\'s \\nstill breathing, but he\\'s a goner.\" \\n \\nOld Parlay groaned, moved one arm impotently, and opened his eyes. In them \\nwas the light of recognition. \\n \\n\"My brave gentlemen,\" he whispered haltingly. \"Don\\'t forget... the auction... at ten \\no\\'clock... in hell.\" \\n \\nHis eyes dropped shut and the lower jaw threatened to drop, but he mastered the \\nqualms of dissolution long enough to omit one final, loud, derisive cackle. \\n \\nAbove and below pandemonium broke out. \\n \\nThe old familiar roar of the wind was with them. The Malahini, caught broadside, \\nwas pressed down almost on her beam ends as she swung the arc compelled by \\nher anchors. They rounded her into the wind, where she jerked to an even keel. \\nThe propeller was thrown on, and the engine took up its work again. \\n \\n\"Northwest!\" Captain Warfield shouted to Grief when he came on deck. \"Hauled \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n151 \\neight points like a shot!\" \\n \\n\"Narii\\'ll never get across the lagoon now!\" Grief observed. \\n \\n\"Then he\\'ll blow back to our side, worse luck!\" \\n \\n \\n \\n V \\n \\nAfter the passing of the centre the barometer began to rise. Equally rapid was the \\nfall of the wind. When it was no more than a howling gale, the engine lifted up in \\nthe air, parted its bed-plates with a last convulsive effort of its forty horsepower, \\nand lay down on its side. A wash of water from the bilge sizzled over it and the \\nsteam arose in clouds. The engineer wailed his dismay, but Grief glanced over the \\nwreck affectionately and went into the cabin to swab the grease off his chest and \\narms with bunches of cotton waste. \\n \\nThe sun was up and the gentlest of summer breezes blowing when he came on \\ndeck, after sewing up the scalp of one Kanaka and setting the other\\'s arm. The \\nMalahini lay close in to the beach. For\\'ard, Hermann and the crew were heaving \\nin and straightening out the tangle of anchors. The Papara and the Tahaa were \\ngone, and Captain Warfield, through the glasses, was searching the opposite rim \\nof the atoll. \\n \\n\"Not a stick left of them,\" he said. \"That\\'s what comes of not having engines. They \\nmust have dragged across before the big shift came.\" \\n \\nAshore, where Parlay\\'s house had been, was no vestige of any house. For the \\nspace of three hundred yards, where the sea had breached, no tree or even stump \\nwas left. Here and there, farther along, stood an occasional palm, and there were \\nnumbers which had been snapped off above the ground. In the crown of one \\nsurviving palm Tai-Hotauri asserted he saw something move. There were no boats \\nleft to the Malahini, and they watched him swim ashore and climb the tree. \\n \\nWhen he came back, they helped over the rail a young native girl of Parley\\'s \\nhousehold. But first she passed up to them a battered basket. In it was a litter of \\nblind kittens--all dead save one, that feebly mewed and staggered on awkward \\nlegs. \\n \\n\"Hello!\" said Mulhall. \"Who\\'s that?\" \\n \\nAlong the beach they saw a man walking. He moved casually, as if out for a \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n152 \\nmorning stroll. Captain Warfield gritted his teeth. It was Narii Herring. \\n \\n\"Hello, skipper!\" Narii called, when he was abreast of them. \"Can I come aboard \\nand get some breakfast?\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield\\'s face and neck began to swell and turn purple. He tried to \\nspeak, but choked. \\n \\n\"For two cents--for two cents----\" was all he could manage to articulate. \\n \\nTHE END  \\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com \\n']\n",

From \\nthe latter came the low murmur of a lazy surf, but the sheltered stretch of water, \\nnot more than a hundred yards across to the white beach of pounded coral sand, \\nwas of glass-like smoothness. Narrow as was the passage, and anchored as she \\nwas in the shoalest place that gave room to swing, the Willi-Waw's chain rode up-\\nand-down a clean hundred feet. Its course could be traced over the bottom of \\nliving coral. Like some monstrous snake, the rusty chain's slack wandered over \\nthe ocean floor, crossing and recrossing itself several times and fetching up finally \\nat the idle anchor. Big rock-cod, dun and mottled, played warily in and out of the \\ncoral. Other fish, grotesque of form and colour, were brazenly indifferent, even \\nwhen a big fish-shark drifted sluggishly along and sent the rock-cod scuttling for \\ntheir favourite crevices. \\n \\nOn deck, for'ard, a dozen blacks pottered clumsily at scraping the teak rail. They \\nwere as inexpert at their work as so many monkeys. In fact they looked very \\nmuch like monkeys of some enlarged and prehistoric type. Their eyes had in them \\nthe querulous plaintiveness of the monkey, their faces were even less symmetrical \\nthan the monkey's, and, hairless of body, they were far more ungarmented than \\nany monkey, for clothes they had none. Decorated they were as no monkey ever \\nwas. In holes in their ears they carried short clay pipes, rings of turtle shell, huge \\nplugs of wood, rusty wire nails, and empty rifle cartridges. The calibre of a \\nWinchester rifle was the smallest hole an ear bore; some of the largest holes were \\ninches in diameter, and any single ear averaged from three to half a dozen holes. \\nSpikes and bodkins of polished bone or petrified shell were thrust through their \\nnoses. On the chest of one hung a white doorknob, on the chest of another the \\nhandle of a china cup, on the chest of a third the brass cogwheel of an alarm \\nclock. They chattered in queer, falsetto voices, and, combined, did no more work \\nthan a single white sailor. \\n \\nAft, under an awning, were two white men. Each was clad in a six-penny \\nundershirt and wrapped about the loins with a strip of cloth. Belted about the \\nmiddle of each was a revolver and tobacco pouch. The sweat stood out on their \\nskin in myriads of globules. Here and there the globules coalesced in tiny streams \\nthat dripped to the heated deck and almost immediately evaporated. The lean, \\ndark-eyed man wiped his fingers wet with a stinging stream from his forehead \\nand flung it from him with a weary curse. Wearily, and without hope, he gazed \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n4 \\nseaward across the outer-reef, and at the tops of the palms along the beach. \\n \\n\"Eight o\\'clock, an\\' hell don\\'t get hot till noon,\" he complained. \"Wisht to God for a \\nbreeze. Ain\\'t we never goin\\' to get away?\" \\n \\nThe other man, a slender German of five and twenty, with the massive forehead of \\na scholar and the tumble-home chin of a degenerate, did not trouble to reply. He \\nwas busy emptying powdered quinine into a cigarette paper. Rolling what was \\napproximately fifty grains of the drug into a tight wad, he tossed it into his mouth \\nand gulped it down without the aid of water. \\n \\n\"Wisht I had some whiskey,\" the first man panted, after a fifteen-minute interval \\nof silence. \\n \\nAnother equal period elapsed ere the German enounced, relevant of nothing: \\n \\n\"I\\'m rotten with fever. I\\'m going to quit you, Griffiths, when we get to Sydney. No \\nmore tropics for me. I ought to known better when I signed on with you.\" \\n \\n\"You ain\\'t been much of a mate,\" Griffiths replied, too hot himself to speak \\nheatedly. \"When the beach at Guvutu heard I\\'d shipped you, they all laughed. \\n\\'What? Jacobsen?\\' they said. \\'You can\\'t hide a square face of trade gin or \\nsulphuric acid that he won\\'t smell out!\\' You\\'ve certainly lived up to your \\nreputation. I ain\\'t had a drink for a fortnight, what of your snoopin\\' my supply.\" \\n \\n\"If the fever was as rotten in you as me, you\\'d understand,\" the mate whimpered. \\n \\n\"I ain\\'t kickin\\',\" Griffiths answered. \"I only wisht God\\'d send me a drink, or a \\nbreeze of wind, or something. I\\'m ripe for my next chill to-morrow.\" \\n \\nThe mate proffered him the quinine. Rolling a fifty-grain dose, he popped the wad \\ninto his mouth and swallowed it dry. \\n \\n\"God! God!\" he moaned. \"I dream of a land somewheres where they ain\\'t no \\nquinine. Damned stuff of hell! I\\'ve scoffed tons of it in my time.\" \\n \\nAgain he quested seaward for signs of wind. The usual trade-wind clouds were \\nabsent, and the sun, still low in its climb to meridian, turned all the sky to heated \\nbrass. One seemed to see as well as feel this heat, and Griffiths sought vain relief \\nby gazing shoreward. The white beach was a searing ache to his eyeballs. The \\npalm trees, absolutely still, outlined flatly against the unrefreshing green of the \\npacked jungle, seemed so much cardboard scenery. The little black boys, playing \\nnaked in the dazzle of sand and sun, were an affront and a hurt to the sun-sick \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n5 \\nman. He felt a sort of relief when one, running, tripped and fell on all-fours in the \\ntepid sea-water. \\n \\nAn exclamation from the blacks for\\'ard sent both men glancing seaward. Around \\nthe near point of land, a quarter of a mile away and skirting the reef, a long black \\ncanoe paddled into sight. \\n \\n\"Gooma boys from the next bight,\" was the mate\\'s verdict. \\n \\nOne of the blacks came aft, treading the hot deck with the unconcern of one \\nwhose bare feet felt no heat. This, too, was a hurt to Griffiths, and he closed his \\neyes. But the next moment they were open wide. \\n \\n\"White fella marster stop along Gooma boy,\" the black said. \\n \\nBoth men were on their feet and gazing at the canoe. Aft could be seen the \\nunmistakable sombrero of a white man. Quick alarm showed itself on the face of \\nthe mate. \\n \\n\"It\\'s Grief,\" he said. \\n \\nGriffiths satisfied himself by a long look, then ripped out a wrathful oath. \\n \\n\"What\\'s he doing up here?\" he demanded of the mate, of the aching sea and sky, \\nof the merciless blaze of sun, and of the whole superheated and implacable \\nuniverse with which his fate was entangled. \\n \\nThe mate began to chuckle. \\n \\n\"I told you you couldn\\'t get away with it,\" he said. \\n \\nBut Griffiths was not listening. \\n \\n\"With all his money, coming around like a rent collector,\" he chanted his outrage, \\nalmost in an ecstasy of anger. \"He\\'s loaded with money, he\\'s stuffed with money, \\nhe\\'s busting with money. I know for a fact he sold his Yringa plantations for three \\nhundred thousand pounds. Bell told me so himself last time we were drunk at \\nGuvutu. Worth millions and millions, and Shylocking me for what he wouldn\\'t \\nlight his pipe with.\" He whirled on the mate. \"Of course you told me so. Go on and \\nsay it, and keep on saying it. Now just what was it you did tell me so?\" \\n \\n\"I told you you didn\\'t know him, if you thought you could clear the Solomons \\nwithout paying him. That man Grief is a devil, but he\\'s straight. I know. I told you \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n6 \\nhe\\'d throw a thousand quid away for the fun of it, and for sixpence fight like a \\nshark for a rusty tin, I tell you I know. Didn\\'t he give his Balakula to the \\nQueensland Mission when they lost their Evening Star on San Cristobal?--and \\nthe Balakula worth three thousand pounds if she was worth a penny? And didn\\'t \\nhe beat up Strothers till he lay abed a fortnight, all because of a difference of two \\npound ten in the account, and because Strothers got fresh and tried to make the \\ngouge go through?\" \\n \\n\"God strike me blind!\" Griffiths cried in im-potency of rage. \\n \\nThe mate went on with his exposition. \\n \\n\"I tell you only a straight man can buck a straight man like him, and the man\\'s \\nnever hit the Solomons that could do it. Men like you and me can\\'t buck him. \\nWe\\'re too rotten, too rotten all the way through. You\\'ve got plenty more than \\ntwelve hundred quid below. Pay him, and get it over with.\" \\n \\nBut Griffiths gritted his teeth and drew his thin lips tightly across them. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll buck him,\" he muttered--more to himself and the brazen ball of sun than to \\nthe mate. He turned and half started to go below, then turned back again. \"Look \\nhere, Jacob-sen. He won\\'t be here for quarter of an hour. Are you with me? Will \\nyou stand by me?\" \\n \\n\"Of course I\\'ll stand by you. I\\'ve drunk all your whiskey, haven\\'t I? What are you \\ngoing to do?\" \\n \\n\"I\\'m not going to kill him if I can help it. But I\\'m not going to pay. Take that flat.\" \\n \\nJacobsen shrugged his shoulders in calm acquiescence to fate, and Griffiths \\nstepped to the companionway and went below. \\n \\nII \\n \\nJacobsen watched the canoe across the low reef as it came abreast and passed on \\nto the entrance of the passage. Griffiths, with ink-marks on right thumb and \\nforefinger, returned on deck Fifteen minutes later the canoe came alongside. The \\nman with the sombrero stood up. \\n \\n\"Hello, Griffiths!\" he said. \"Hello, Jacobsen!\" With his hand on the rail he turned \\nto his dusky crew. \"You fella boy stop along canoe altogether.\" \\n \\nAs he swung over the rail and stepped on deck a hint of catlike litheness showed \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n7 \\nin the apparently heavy body. Like the other two, he was scantily clad. The cheap \\nundershirt and white loin-cloth did not serve to hide the well put up body. Heavy \\nmuscled he was, but he was not lumped and hummocked by muscles. They were \\nsoftly rounded, and, when they did move, slid softly and silkily under the smooth, \\ntanned skin. Ardent suns had likewise tanned his face till it was swarthy as a \\nSpaniard\\'s. The yellow mustache appeared incongruous in the midst of such \\nswarthiness, while the clear blue of the eyes produced a feeling of shock on the \\nbeholder. It was difficult to realize that the skin of this man had once been fair. \\n \\n\"Where did you blow in from?\" Griffiths asked, as they shook hands. \"I thought \\nyou were over in the Santa Cruz.\" \\n \\n\"I was,\" the newcomer answered. \"But we made a quick passage. The Wonder\\'s \\njust around in the bight at Gooma, waiting for wind. Some of the bushmen \\nreported a ketch here, and I just dropped around to see. Well, how goes it?\" \\n \\n\"Nothing much. Copra sheds mostly empty, and not half a dozen tons of ivory \\nnuts. The women all got rotten with fever and quit, and the men can\\'t chase them \\nback into the swamps. They\\'re a sick crowd. I\\'d ask you to have a drink, but the \\nmate finished off my last bottle. I wisht to God for a breeze of wind.\" \\n \\nGrief, glancing with keen carelessness from one to the other, laughed. \\n \\n\"I\\'m glad the calm held,\" he said. \"It enabled me to get around to see you. My \\nsupercargo dug up that little note of yours, and I brought it along.\" \\n \\nThe mate edged politely away, leaving his skipper to face his trouble. \\n \\n\"I\\'m sorry, Grief, damned sorry,\" Griffiths said, \"but I ain\\'t got it. You\\'ll have to \\ngive me a little more time.\" \\n \\nGrief leaned up against the companionway, surprise and pain depicted on his \\nface. \\n \\n\"It does beat hell,\" he communed, \"how men learn to lie in the Solomons. The \\ntruth\\'s not in them. Now take Captain Jensen. I\\'d sworn by his truthfulness. \\nWhy, he told me only five days ago--do you want to know what he told me?\" \\n \\nGriffiths licked his lips. \\n \\n\"Go on.\" \\n \\n\"Why, he told me that you\\'d sold out--sold out everything, cleaned up, and was \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n8 \\npulling out for the New Hebrides.\" \\n \\n\"He\\'s a damned liar!\" Griffiths cried hotly. \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"I should say so. He even had the nerve to tell me that he\\'d bought two of your \\nstations from you--Mauri and Kahula. Said he paid you seventeen hundred gold \\nsovereigns, lock, stock and barrel, good will, trade-goods, credit, and copra.\" \\n \\nGriffiths\\'s eyes narrowed and glinted. The action was involuntary, and Grief noted \\nit with a lazy sweep of his eyes. \\n \\n\"And Parsons, your trader at Hickimavi, told me that the Fulcrum Company had \\nbought that station from you. Now what did he want to lie for?\" \\n \\nGriffiths, overwrought by sun and sickness, exploded. All his bitterness of spirit \\nrose up in his face and twisted his mouth into a snarl. \\n \\n\"Look here, Grief, what\\'s the good of playing with me that way? You know, and I \\nknow you know. Let it go at that. I have sold out, and I am getting away. And \\nwhat are you going to do about it?\" \\n \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders, and no hint of resolve shadowed itself in his own \\nface. His expression was as of one in a quandary. \\n \\n\"There\\'s no law here,\" Griffiths pressed home his advantage. \"Tulagi is a hundred \\nand fifty miles away. I\\'ve got my clearance papers, and I\\'m on my own boat. \\nThere\\'s nothing to stop me from sailing. You\\'ve got no right to stop me just \\nbecause I owe you a little money. And by God! you can\\'t stop me. Put that in your \\npipe.\" \\n \\nThe look of pained surprise on Grief\\'s face deepened. \\n \\n\"You mean you\\'re going to cheat me out of that twelve hundred, Griffiths?\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s just about the size of it, old man. And calling hard names won\\'t help any. \\nThere\\'s the wind coming. You\\'d better get overside before I pull out, or I\\'ll tow \\nyour canoe under.\" \\n \\n\"Really, Griffiths, you sound almost right. I can\\'t stop you.\" Grief fumbled in the \\npouch that hung on his revolver-belt and pulled out a crumpled official-looking \\npaper. \"But maybe this will stop you. And it\\'s something for your pipe. Smoke \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n9 \\nup.\" \\n \\n\"What is it?\" \\n \\n\"An admiralty warrant. Running to the New Hebrides won\\'t save you. It can be \\nserved anywhere.\" \\n \\nGriffiths hesitated and swallowed, when he had finished glancing at the \\ndocument. With knit brows he pondered this new phase of the situation. Then, \\nabruptly, as he looked up, his face relaxed into all frankness. \\n \\n\"You were cleverer than I thought, old man,\" he said. \"You\\'ve got me hip and \\nthigh. I ought to have known better than to try and beat you. Jacobsen told me I \\ncouldn\\'t, and I wouldn\\'t listen to him. But he was right, and so are you. I\\'ve got \\nthe money below. Come on down and we\\'ll settle.\" \\n \\nHe started to go down, then stepped aside to let his visitor precede him, at the \\nsame time glancing seaward to where the dark flaw of wind was quickening the \\nwater. \\n \\n\"Heave short,\" he told the mate. \"Get up sail and stand ready to break out.\" \\n \\nAs Grief sat down on the edge of the mate\\'s bunk, close against and facing the \\ntiny table, he noticed the butt of a revolver just projecting from under the pillow. \\nOn the table, which hung on hinges from the for\\'ard bulkhead, were pen and ink, \\nalso a battered log-book. \\n \\n\"Oh, I don\\'t mind being caught in a dirty trick,\" Griffiths was saying defiantly. \\n\"I\\'ve been in the tropics too long. I\\'m a sick man, a damn sick man. And the \\nwhiskey, and the sun, and the fever have made me sick in morals, too. Nothing\\'s \\ntoo mean and low for me now, and I can understand why the niggers eat each \\nother, and take heads, and such things. I could do it myself. So I call trying to do \\nyou out of that small account a pretty mild trick. Wisht I could offer you a drink.\" \\n \\nGrief made no reply, and the other busied himself in attempting to unlock a large \\nand much-dented cash-box. From on deck came falsetto cries and the creak and \\nrattle of blocks as the black crew swung up mainsail and driver. Grief watched a \\nlarge cockroach crawling over the greasy paintwork. Griffiths, with an oath of \\nirritation, carried the cash-box to the companion-steps for better light. Here, on \\nhis feet, and bending over the box, his back to his visitor, his hands shot out to \\nthe rifle that stood beside the steps, and at the same moment he whirled about. \\n \\n\"Now don\\'t you move a muscle,\" he commanded. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n10 \\n \\nGrief smiled, elevated his eyebrows quizzically, and obeyed. His left hand rested \\non the bunk beside him; his right hand lay on the table. \\n \\nHis revolver hung on his right hip in plain sight. But in his mind was recollection \\nof the other revolver under the pillow. \\n \\n\"Huh!\" Griffiths sneered. \"You\\'ve got everybody in the Solomons hypnotized, but \\nlet me tell you you ain\\'t got me. Now I\\'m going to throw you off my vessel, along \\nwith your admiralty warrant, but first you\\'ve got to do something. Lift up that log-\\nbook.\" \\n \\nThe other glanced curiously at the log-book, but did not move. \\n \\n\"I tell you I\\'m a sick man, Grief; and I\\'d as soon shoot you as smash a cockroach. \\nLift up that log-book, I say.\" \\n \\nSick he did look, his lean face working nervously with the rage that possessed \\nhim. Grief lifted the book and set it aside. Beneath lay a written sheet of tablet \\npaper. \\n \\n\"Read it,\" Griffiths commanded. \"Read it aloud.\" \\n \\nGrief obeyed; but while he read, the fingers of his left hand began an infinitely \\nslow and patient crawl toward the butt of the weapon under the pillow. \\n \\n\"On board the ketch Willi-Waw, Bombi Bight, Island of Anna, Solomon Islands,\" \\nhe read. \"Know all men by these presents that I do hereby sign off and release in \\nfull, for due value received, all debts whatsoever owing to me by Harrison J. \\nGriffiths, who has this day paid to me twelve hundred pounds sterling.\" \\n \\n\"With that receipt in my hands,\" Griffiths grinned, \"your admiralty warrant\\'s not \\nworth the paper it\\'s written on. Sign it.\" \\n \\n\"It won\\'t do any good, Griffiths,\" Grief said. \"A document signed under \\ncompulsion won\\'t hold before the law.\" \\n \\n\"In that case, what objection have you to signing it then?\" \\n \\n\"Oh, none at all, only that I might save you heaps of trouble by not signing it.\" \\n \\nGrief\\'s fingers had gained the revolver, and, while he talked, with his right hand \\nhe played with the pen and with his left began slowly and imperceptibly drawing \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n11 \\nthe weapon to his side. As his hand finally closed upon it, second finger on trigger \\nand forefinger laid past the cylinder and along the barrel, he wondered what luck \\nhe would have at left-handed snap-shooting. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t consider me,\" Griffiths gibed. \"And just remember Jacobsen will testify that \\nhe saw me pay the money over. Now sign, sign in full, at the bottom, David Grief, \\nand date it.\" \\n \\nFrom on deck came the jar of sheet-blocks and the rat-tat-tat of the reef-points \\nagainst the canvas. In the cabin they could feel the Willi-Waw heel, swing into the \\nwind, and right. David Grief still hesitated. From for\\'ard came the jerking rattle of \\nheadsail halyards through the sheaves. The little vessel heeled, and through the \\ncabin walls came the gurgle and wash of water. \\n \\n\"Get a move on!\" Griffiths cried. \"The anchor\\'s out.\" \\n \\nThe muzzle of the rifle, four feet away, was bearing directly on him, when Grief \\nresolved to act. The rifle wavered as Griffiths kept his balance in the uncertain \\npuffs of the first of the wind. Grief took advantage of the wavering, made as if to \\nsign the paper, and at the same instant, like a cat, exploded into swift and \\nintricate action. As he ducked low and leaped forward with his body, his left hand \\nflashed from under the screen of the table, and so accurately-timed was the \\nsingle stiff pull on the self-cocking trigger that the cartridge discharged as the \\nmuzzle came forward. Not a whit behind was Griffiths. The muzzle of his weapon \\ndropped to meet the ducking body, and, shot at snap direction, rifle and revolver \\nwent off simultaneously. \\n \\nGrief felt the sting and sear of a bullet across the skin of his shoulder, and knew \\nthat his own shot had missed. His forward rush carried him to Griffiths before \\nanother shot could be fired, both of whose arms, still holding the rifle, he locked \\nwith a low tackle about the body. He shoved the revolver muzzle, still in his left \\nhand, deep into the other\\'s abdomen. Under the press of his anger and the sting \\nof his abraded skin, Grief\\'s finger was lifting the hammer, when the wave of anger \\npassed and he recollected himself. Down the companion-way came indignant \\ncries from the Gooma boys in his canoe. \\n \\nEverything was happening in seconds. There was apparently no pause in his \\nactions as he gathered Griffiths in his arms and carried him up the steep steps in \\na sweeping rush. Out into the blinding glare of sunshine he came. A black stood \\ngrinning at the wheel, and the Willi-Waw, heeled over from the wind, was foaming \\nalong. Rapidly dropping astern was his Gooma canoe. Grief turned his head. \\nFrom amidships, revolver in hand, the mate was springing toward him. With two \\njumps, still holding the helpless Griffiths, Grief leaped to the rail and overboard. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n12 \\n \\nBoth men were grappled together as they went down; but Grief, with a quick \\nupdraw of his knees to the other\\'s chest, broke the grip and forced him down. \\nWith both feet on Griffiths\\'s shoulder, he forced him still deeper, at the same time \\ndriving himself to the surface. Scarcely had his head broken into the sunshine \\nwhen two splashes of water, in quick succession and within a foot of his face, \\nadvertised that Jacobsen knew how to handle a revolver. There was a chance for \\nno third shot, for Grief, filling his lungs with air, sank down. Under water he \\nstruck out, nor did he come up till he saw the canoe and the bubbling paddles \\noverhead. As he climbed aboard, the Wlli-Waw went into the wind to come about. \\n \\n\"Washee-washee!\" Grief cried to his boys. \"You fella make-um beach quick fella \\ntime!\" \\n \\nIn all shamelessness, he turned his back on the battle and ran for cover. The \\nWilli-Waw, compelled to deaden way in order to pick up its captain, gave Grief his \\nchance for a lead. The canoe struck the beach full-tilt, with every paddle driving, \\nand they leaped out and ran across the sand for the trees. But before they gained \\nthe shelter, three times the sand kicked into puffs ahead of them. Then they dove \\ninto the green safety of the jungle. \\n \\nGrief watched the Willi-Waw haul up close, go out the passage, then slack its \\nsheets as it headed south with the wind abeam. As it went out of sight past the \\npoint he could see the topsail being broken out. One of the Gooma boys, a black, \\nnearly fifty years of age, hideously marred and scarred by skin diseases and old \\nwounds, looked up into his face and grinned. \\n \\n\"My word,\" the boy commented, \"that fella skipper too much cross along you.\" \\n \\nGrief laughed, and led the way back across the sand to the canoe. \\n \\nIII \\n \\nHow many millions David Grief was worth no man in the Solomons knew, for his \\nholdings and ventures were everywhere in the great South Pacific. From Samoa to \\nNew Guinea and even to the north of the Line his plantations were scattered. He \\npossessed pearling concessions in the Paumotus. Though his name did not \\nappear, he was in truth the German company that traded in the French \\nMarquesas. His trading stations were in strings in all the groups, and his vessels \\nthat operated them were many. He owned atolls so remote and tiny that his \\nsmallest schooners and ketches visited the solitary agents but once a year. \\n \\nIn Sydney, on Castlereagh Street, his offices occupied three floors. But he was \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n13 \\nrarely in those offices. He preferred always to be on the go amongst the islands, \\nnosing out new investments, inspecting and shaking up old ones, and rubbing \\nshoulders with fun and adventure in a thousand strange guises. He bought the \\nwreck of the great steamship Gavonne for a song, and in salving it achieved the \\nimpossible and cleaned up a quarter of a million. In the Louisiades he planted the \\nfirst commercial rubber, and in Bora-Bora he ripped out the South Sea cotton \\nand put the jolly islanders at the work of planting cacao. It was he who took the \\ndeserted island of Lallu-Ka, colonized it with Polynesians from the Ontong-Java \\nAtoll, and planted four thousand acres to cocoanuts. And it was he who \\nreconciled the warring chief-stocks of Tahiti and swung the great deal of the \\nphosphate island of Hikihu. \\n \\nHis own vessels recruited his contract labour. They brought Santa Cruz boys to \\nthe New Hebrides, New Hebrides boys to the Banks, and the head-hunting \\ncannibals of Malaita to the plantations of New Georgia. From Tonga to the \\nGilberts and on to the far Louisiades his recruiters combed the islands for labour. \\nHis keels plowed all ocean stretches. He owned three steamers on regular island \\nruns, though he rarely elected to travel in them, preferring the wilder and more \\nprimitive way of wind and sail. \\n \\nAt least forty years of age, he looked no more than thirty. Yet beachcombers \\nremembered his advent among the islands a score of years before, at which time \\nthe yellow mustache was already budding silkily on his lip. Unlike other white \\nmen in the tropics, he was there because he liked it. His protective skin \\npigmentation was excellent. He had been born to the sun. One he was in ten \\nthousand in the matter of sun-resistance. The invisible and high-velocity light \\nwaves failed to bore into him. Other white men were pervious. The sun drove \\nthrough their skins, ripping and smashing tissues and nerves, till they became \\nsick in mind and body, tossed most of the Decalogue overboard, descended to \\nbeastliness, drank themselves into quick graves, or survived so savagely that war \\nvessels were sometimes sent to curb their license. \\n \\nBut David Grief was a true son of the sun, and he flourished in all its ways. He \\nmerely became browner with the passing of the years, though in the brown was \\nthe hint of golden tint that glows in the skin of the Polynesian. Yet his blue eyes \\nretained their blue, his mustache its yellow, and the lines of his face were those \\nwhich had persisted through the centuries in his English race. English he was in \\nblood, yet those that thought they knew contended he was at least American \\nborn. Unlike them, he had not come out to the South Seas seeking hearth and \\nsaddle of his own. In fact, he had brought hearth and saddle with him. His \\nadvent had been in the Paumotus. He arrived on board a tiny schooner yacht, \\nmaster and owner, a youth questing romance and adventure along the sun-\\nwashed path of the tropics. He also arrived in a hurricane, the giant waves of \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n14 \\nwhich deposited him and yacht and all in the thick of a cocoanut grove three \\nhundred yards beyond the surf. Six months later he was rescued by a pearling \\ncutter. But the sun had got into his blood. At Tahiti, instead of taking a steamer \\nhome, he bought a schooner, outfitted her with trade-goods and divers, and went \\nfor a cruise through the Dangerous Archipelago. \\n \\nAs the golden tint burned into his face it poured molten out of the ends of his \\nfingers. His was the golden touch, but he played the game, not for the gold, but \\nfor the game\\'s sake. It was a man\\'s game, the rough contacts and fierce give and \\ntake of the adventurers of his own blood and of half the bloods of Europe and the \\nrest of the world, and it was a good game; but over and beyond was his love of all \\nthe other things that go to make up a South Seas rover\\'s life--the smell of the \\nreef; the infinite exquisiteness of the shoals of living coral in the mirror-surfaced \\nlagoons; the crashing sunrises of raw colours spread with lawless cunning; the \\npalm-tufted islets set in turquoise deeps; the tonic wine of the trade-winds; the \\nheave and send of the orderly, crested seas; the moving deck beneath his feet, the \\nstraining canvas overhead; the flower-garlanded, golden-glowing men and maids \\nof Polynesia, half-children and half-gods; and even the howling savages of \\nMelanesia, head-hunters and man-eaters, half-devil and all beast. \\n \\nAnd so, favoured child of the sun, out of munificence of energy and sheer joy of \\nliving, he, the man of many millions, forbore on his far way to play the game with \\nHarrison J. Griffiths for a paltry sum. It was his whim, his desire, his expression \\nof self and of the sun-warmth that poured through him. It was fun, a joke, a \\nproblem, a bit of play on which life was lightly hazarded for the joy of the playing. \\n \\nIV \\n \\nThe early morning found the Wonder laying close-hauled along the coast of \\nGuadalcanal She moved lazily through the water under the dying breath of the \\nland breeze. To the east, heavy masses of clouds promised a renewal of the \\nsoutheast trades, accompanied by sharp puffs and rain squalls. Ahead, laying \\nalong the coast on the same course as the Wonder, and being slowly overtaken, \\nwas a small ketch. It was not the Willi-Waw, however, and Captain Ward, on the \\nWonder, putting down his glasses, named it the Kauri. \\n \\nGrief, just on deck from below, sighed regretfully. \\n \\n\"If it had only been the Willi-Waw\" he said. \\n \\n\"You do hate to be beaten,\" Denby, the supercargo, remarked sympathetically. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n15 \\n\"I certainly do.\" Grief paused and laughed with genuine mirth. \"It\\'s my firm \\nconviction that Griffiths is a rogue, and that he treated me quite scurvily \\nyesterday. \\'Sign,\\' he says, \\'sign in full, at the bottom, and date it,\\' And Jacobsen, \\nthe little rat, stood in with him. It was rank piracy, the days of Bully Hayes all \\nover again.\" \\n \\n\"If you weren\\'t my employer, Mr. Grief, I\\'d like to give you a piece of my mind,\" \\nCaptain Ward broke in. \\n \\n\"Go on and spit it out,\" Grief encouraged. \\n \\n\"Well, then--\" The captain hesitated and cleared his throat. \"With all the money \\nyou\\'ve got, only a fool would take the risk you did with those two curs. What do \\nyou do it for?\" \\n \\n\"Honestly, I don\\'t know, Captain. I just want to, I suppose. And can you give any \\nbetter reason for anything you do?\" \\n \\n\"You\\'ll get your bally head shot off some fine day,\" Captain Ward growled in \\nanswer, as he stepped to the binnacle and took the bearing of a peak which had \\njust thrust its head through the clouds that covered Guadalcanar. \\n \\nThe land breeze strengthened in a last effort, and the Wonder, slipping swiftly \\nthrough the water, ranged alongside the Kauri and began to go by. Greetings flew \\nback and forth, then David Grief called out: \\n \\n\"Seen anything of the Willi-Waw?\" \\n \\nThe captain, slouch-hatted and barelegged, with a rolling twist hitched the faded \\nblue lava-lava tighter around his waist and spat tobacco juice overside. \\n \\n\"Sure,\" he answered. \"Griffiths lay at Savo last night, taking on pigs and yams \\nand filling his water-tanks. Looked like he was going for a long cruise, but he said \\nno. Why? Did you want to see him?\" \\n \\n\"Yes; but if you see him first don\\'t tell him you\\'ve seen me.\" \\n \\nThe captain nodded and considered, and walked for\\'ard on his own deck to keep \\nabreast of the faster vessel. \\n \\n\"Say!\" he called. \"Jacobsen told me they were coming down this afternoon to \\nGabera. Said they were going to lay there to-night and take on sweet potatoes.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n16 \\n\"Gabera has the only leading lights in the Solomons,\" Grief said, when his \\nschooner had drawn well ahead. \"Is that right, Captain Ward?\" \\n \\nThe captain nodded. \\n \\n\"And the little bight just around the point on this side, it\\'s a rotten anchorage, \\nisn\\'t it?\" \\n \\n\"No anchorage. All coral patches and shoals, and a bad surf. That\\'s where the \\nMolly went to pieces three years ago.\" \\n \\nGrief stared straight before him with lustreless eyes for a full minute, as if \\nsummoning some vision to his inner sight. Then the corners of his eyes wrinkled \\nand the ends of his yellow mustache lifted in a smile. \\n \\n\"We\\'ll anchor at Gabera,\" he said. \"And run in close to the little bight this side. I \\nwant you to drop me in a whaleboat as you go by. Also, give me six boys, and \\nserve out rifles. I\\'ll be back on board before morning.\" \\n \\nThe captain\\'s face took on an expression of suspicion, which swiftly slid into one \\nof reproach. \\n \\n\"Oh, just a little fun, skipper,\" Grief protested with the apologetic air of a \\nschoolboy caught in mischief by an elder. \\n \\nCaptain Ward grunted, but Denby was all alertness. \\n \\n\"I\\'d like to go along, Mr. Grief,\" he said. \\n \\nGrief nodded consent. \\n \\n\"Bring some axes and bush-knives,\" he said. \"And, oh, by the way, a couple of \\nbright lanterns. See they\\'ve got oil in them.\" \\n \\nV \\n \\nAn hour before sunset the Wonder tore by the little bight. The wind had \\nfreshened, and a lively sea was beginning to make. The shoals toward the beach \\nwere already white with the churn of water, while those farther out as yet showed \\nno more sign than of discoloured water. As the schooner went into the wind and \\nbacked her jib and staysail the whaleboat was swung out. Into it leaped six \\nbreech-clouted Santa Cruz boys, each armed with a rifle. Denby, carrying the \\nlanterns, dropped into the stern-sheets. Grief, following, paused on the rail. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n17 \\n \\n\"Pray for a dark night, skipper,\" he pleaded. \\n \\n\"You\\'ll get it,\" Captain Ward answered. \"There\\'s no moon anyway, and there won\\'t \\nbe any sky. She\\'ll be a bit squally, too.\" \\n \\nThe forecast sent a radiance into Grief\\'s face, making more pronounced the \\ngolden tint of his sunburn. He leaped down beside the supercargo. \\n \\n\"Cast off!\" Captain Ward ordered. \"Draw the headsails! Put your wheel over! \\nThere! Steady! Take that course!\" \\n \\nThe Wonder filled away and ran on around the point for Gabera, while the \\nwhaleboat, pulling six oars and steered by Grief, headed for the beach. With \\nsuperb boatmanship he threaded the narrow, tortuous channel which no craft \\nlarger than a whaleboat could negotiate, until the shoals and patches showed \\nseaward and they grounded on the quiet, rippling beach. \\n \\nThe next hour was filled with work. Moving about among the wild cocoanuts and \\njungle brush, Grief selected the trees. \\n \\n\"Chop this fella tree; chop that fella tree,\" he told his blacks. \"No chop that other \\nfella,\" he said, with a shake of head. \\n \\nIn the end, a wedge-shaped segment of jungle was cleared. Near to the beach \\nremained one long palm. At the apex of the wedge stood another. Darkness was \\nfalling as the lanterns were lighted, carried up the two trees, and made fast. \\n \\n\"That outer lantern is too high.\" David Grief studied it critically. \"Put it down \\nabout ten feet, Denby.\" \\n \\nVI \\n \\nThe Willi-Waw was tearing through the water with a bone in her teeth, for the \\nbreath of the passing squall was still strong. The blacks were swinging up the big \\nmainsail, which had been lowered on the run when the puff was at its height. \\nJacobsen, superintending the operation, ordered them to throw the halyards \\ndown on deck and stand by, then went for\\'ard on the lee-bow and joined Griffiths. \\nBoth men stared with wide-strained eyes at the blank wall of darkness through \\nwhich they were flying, their ears tense for the sound of surf on the invisible \\nshore. It was by this sound that they were for the moment steering. \\n \\nThe wind fell lighter, the scud of clouds thinned and broke, and in the dim \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n18 \\nglimmer of starlight loomed the jungle-clad coast. Ahead, and well on the lee-bow, \\nappeared a jagged rock-point. Both men strained to it. \\n \\n\"Amboy Point,\" Griffiths announced. \"Plenty of water close up. Take the wheel, \\nJacobsen, till we set a course. Get a move on!\" \\n \\nRunning aft, barefooted and barelegged, the rainwater dripping from his scant \\nclothing, the mate displaced the black at the wheel. \\n \\n\"How\\'s she heading?\" Griffiths called. \\n \\n\"South-a-half-west!\" \\n \\n\"Let her come up south-by-west! Got it?\" \\n \\n\"Right on it!\" \\n \\nGriffiths considered the changed relation of Amboy Point to the Willi-Waw\\'s \\ncourse. \\n \\n\"And a-half-west!\" he cried. \\n \\n\"And a-half-west!\" came the answer. \"Right on it!\" \\n \\n\"Steady! That\\'ll do!\" \\n \\n\"Steady she is!\" Jacobsen turned the wheel over to the savage. \"You steer good \\nfella, savve?\" he warned. \"No good fella, I knock your damn black head off.\" \\n \\nAgain he went for\\'ard and joined the other, and again the cloud-scud thickened, \\nthe star-glimmer vanished, and the wind rose and screamed in another squall. \\n \\n\"Watch that mainsail!\" Griffiths yelled in the mate\\'s ear, at the same time \\nstudying the ketch\\'s behaviour. \\n \\nOver she pressed, and lee-rail under, while he measured the weight of the wind \\nand quested its easement. The tepid sea-water, with here and there tiny globules \\nof phosphorescence, washed about his ankles and knees. The wind screamed a \\nhigher note, and every shroud and stay sharply chorused an answer as the Willi-\\nWaw pressed farther over and down. \\n \\n\"Down mainsail!\" Griffiths yelled, springing to the peak-halyards, thrusting away \\nthe black who held on, and casting off the turn. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n19 \\n \\nJacobsen, at the throat-halyards, was performing the like office. The big sail \\nrattled down, and the blacks, with shouts and yells, threw themselves on the \\nbattling canvas. The mate, finding one skulking in the darkness, flung his \\nbunched knuckles into the creature\\'s face and drove him to his work. \\n \\nThe squall held at its high pitch, and under her small canvas the Willi-Waw still \\nfoamed along. Again the two men stood for\\'ard and vainly watched in the \\nhorizontal drive of rain. \\n \\n\"We\\'re all right,\" Griffiths said. \"This rain won\\'t last. We can hold this course till \\nwe pick up the lights. Anchor in thirteen fathoms. You\\'d better overhaul forty-five \\non a night like this. After that get the gaskets on the mainsail. We won\\'t need it.\" \\n \\nHalf an hour afterward his weary eyes were rewarded by a glimpse of two lights. \\n \\n\"There they are, Jacobsen. I\\'ll take the wheel. Run down the fore-staysail and \\nstand by to let go. Make the niggers jump.\" \\n \\nAft, the spokes of the wheel in his hands, Griffiths held the course till the two \\nlights came in line, when he abruptly altered and headed directly in for them. He \\nheard the tumble and roar of the surf, but decided it was farther away--as it \\nshould be, at Gabera. \\n \\nHe heard the frightened cry of the mate, and was grinding the wheel down with \\nall his might, when the Willi-Waw struck. At the same instant her mainmast \\ncrashed over the bow. Five wild minutes followed. All hands held on while the \\nhull upheaved and smashed down on the brittle coral and the warm seas swept \\nover them. Grinding and crunching, the Willi-Waw worked itself clear over the \\nshoal patch and came solidly to rest in the comparatively smooth and shallow \\nchannel beyond. \\n \\nGriffiths sat down on the edge of the cabin, head bowed on chest, in silent wrath \\nand bitterness. Once he lifted his face to glare at the two white lights, one above \\nthe other and perfectly in line. \\n \\n\"There they are,\" he said. \"And this isn\\'t Gabera. Then what the hell is it?\" \\n \\nThough the surf still roared and across the shoal flung its spray and upper wash \\nover them, the wind died down and the stars came out. Shoreward came the \\nsound of oars. \\n \\n\"What have you had?--an earthquake?\" Griffiths called out. \"The bottom\\'s all \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n20 \\nchanged. I\\'ve anchored here a hundred times in thirteen fathoms. Is that you, \\nWilson?\" \\n \\nA whaleboat came alongside, and a man climbed over the rail. In the faint light \\nGriffiths found an automatic Colt\\'s thrust into his face, and, looking up, saw \\nDavid Grief. \\n \\n\"No, you never anchored here before,\" Grief laughed. \"Gabera\\'s just around the \\npoint, where I\\'ll be as soon as I\\'ve collected that little sum of twelve hundred \\npounds. We won\\'t bother for the receipt. I\\'ve your note here, and I\\'ll just return \\nit.\" \\n \\n\"You did this!\" Griffiths cried, springing to his feet in a sudden gust of rage. \"You \\nfaked those leading lights! You\\'ve wrecked me, and by--\" \\n \\n\"Steady! Steady!\" Grief\\'s voice was cool and menacing. \"I\\'ll trouble you for that \\ntwelve hundred, please.\" \\n \\nTo Griffiths, a vast impotence seemed to descend upon him. He was overwhelmed \\nby a profound disgust--disgust for the sunlands and the sun-sickness, for the \\nfutility of all his endeavour, for this blue-eyed, golden-tinted, superior man who \\ndefeated him on all his ways. \\n \\n\"Jacobsen,\" he said, \"will you open the cash-box and pay this--this bloodsucker--\\ntwelve hundred pounds?\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n21 \\n \\nChapter Two--THE PROUD GOAT OF ALOYSIUS PANKBURN \\n \\n I \\n \\nQuick eye that he had for the promise of adventure, prepared always for the \\nunexpected to leap out at him from behind the nearest cocoanut tree, \\nnevertheless David Grief received no warning when he laid eyes on Aloysius \\nPankburn. It was on the little steamer Berthe. Leaving his schooner to follow, \\nGrief had taken passage for the short run across from Raiatea to Papeete. When \\nhe first saw Aloysius Pankburn, that somewhat fuddled gentleman was drinking a \\nlonely cocktail at the tiny bar between decks next to the barber shop. And when \\nGrief left the barber\\'s hands half an hour later Aloysius Pankburn was still \\nhanging over the bar still drinking by himself. \\n \\nNow it is not good for man to drink alone, and Grief threw sharp scrutiny into his \\npass-ing glance. He saw a well-built young man of thirty, well-featured, well-\\ndressed, and evidently, in the world\\'s catalogue, a gentleman. But in the faint \\nhint of slovenliness, in the shaking, eager hand that spilled the liquor, and in the \\nnervous, vacillating eyes, Grief read the unmistakable marks of the chronic \\nalcoholic. \\n \\nAfter dinner he chanced upon Pankburn again. This time it was on deck, and the \\nyoung man, clinging to the rail and peering into the distance at the dim forms of \\na man and woman in two steamer chairs drawn closely together, was crying, \\ndrunkenly. Grief noted that the man\\'s arm was around the woman\\'s waist. \\nAloysius Pankburn looked on and cried. \\n \\n\"Nothing to weep about,\" Grief said genially. \\n \\nPankburn looked at him, and gushed tears of profound self-pity. \\n \\n\"It\\'s hard,\" he sobbed. \"Hard. Hard. That man\\'s my business manager. I employ \\nhim. I pay him a good screw. And that\\'s how he earns it.\" \\n \\n\"In that case, why don\\'t you put a stop to it?\" Grief advised. \\n \\n\"I can\\'t. She\\'d shut off my whiskey. She\\'s my trained nurse.\" \\n \\n\"Fire her, then, and drink your head off.\" \\n \\n\"I can\\'t. He\\'s got all my money. If I did, he wouldn\\'t give me sixpence to buy a \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n22 \\ndrink with.\" \\n \\nThis woful possibility brought a fresh wash of tears. Grief was interested. Of all \\nunique situations he could never have imagined such a one as this. \\n \\n\"They were engaged to take care of me,\" Pankburn was blubbering, \"to keep me \\naway from the drink. And that\\'s the way they do it, lollygagging all about the ship \\nand letting me drink myself to death. It isn\\'t right, I tell you. It isn\\'t right. They \\nwere sent along with me for the express purpose of not letting me drink, and they \\nlet me drink to swinishness as long as I leave them alone. If I complain they \\nthreaten not to let me have another drop. What can a poor devil do? My death will \\nbe on their heads, that\\'s all. Come on down and join me.\" \\n \\nHe released his clutch on the rail, and would have fallen had Grief not caught his \\narm. He seemed to undergo a transformation, to stiffen physically, to thrust his \\nchin forward aggressively, and to glint harshly in his eyes. \\n \\n\"I won\\'t let them kill me. And they\\'ll be sorry. I\\'ve offered them fifty thousand--\\nlater on, of course. They laughed. They don\\'t know. But I know.\" He fumbled in \\nhis coat pocket and drew forth an object that flashed in the faint light. \"They \\ndon\\'t know the meaning of that. But I do.\" He looked at Grief with abrupt \\nsuspicion. \"What do you make out of it, eh? What do you make out of it?\" \\n \\nDavid Grief caught a swift vision of an alcoholic degenerate putting a very loving \\nyoung couple to death with a copper spike, for a copper spike was what he held in \\nhis hand, an evident old-fashioned ship-fastening. \\n \\n\"My mother thinks I\\'m up here to get cured of the booze habit. She doesn\\'t know. \\nI bribed the doctor to prescribe a voyage. When we get to Papeete my manager is \\ngoing to charter a schooner and away we\\'ll sail. But they don\\'t dream. They think \\nit\\'s the booze. I know. I only know. Good night, sir. I\\'m going to bed--unless--er--\\nyou\\'ll join me in a night cap. One last drink, you know.\" \\n \\nII \\n \\nIn the week that followed at Papeete Grief caught numerous and bizarre glimpses \\nof Aloysius Pankburn. So did everybody else in the little island capital; for neither \\nthe beach nor Lavina\\'s boarding house had been so scandalized in years. In \\nmidday, bareheaded, clad only in swimming trunks, Aloysius Pankburn ran down \\nthe main street from Lavina\\'s to the water front. He put on the gloves with a \\nfireman from the Berthe in a scheduled four-round bout at the Folies Bergères, \\nand was knocked out in the second round. He tried insanely to drown himself in \\na two-foot pool of water, dived drunkenly and splendidly from fifty feet up in the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n23 \\nrigging of the Mariposa lying at the wharf, and chartered the cutter Toerau at \\nmore than her purchase price and was only saved by his manager\\'s refusal \\nfinancially to ratify the agreement. He bought out the old blind leper at the \\nmarket, and sold breadfruit, plantains, and sweet potatoes at such cut-rates that \\nthe gendarmes were called out to break the rush of bargain-hunting natives. For \\nthat matter, three times the gendarmes arrested him for riotous behaviour, and \\nthree times his manager ceased from love-making long enough to pay the fines \\nimposed by a needy colonial administration. \\n \\nThen the Mariposa sailed for San Francisco, and in the bridal suite were the \\nmanager and the trained nurse, fresh-married. Before departing, the manager \\nhad thoughtfully bestowed eight five-pound banknotes on Aloysius, with the \\nforeseen result that Aloysius awoke several days later to find himself broke and \\nperilously near to delirium tremens. Lavina, famed for her good heart even among \\nthe driftage of South Pacific rogues and scamps, nursed him around and never let \\nit filter into his returning intelligence that there was neither manager nor money \\nto pay his board. \\n \\nIt was several evenings after this that David Grief, lounging under the after deck \\nawning of the Kittiwake and idly scanning the meagre columns of the Papeete \\nAvant-Coureur, sat suddenly up and almost rubbed his eyes. It was unbelievable, \\nbut there it was. The old South Seas Romance was not dead. He read: \\n \\n     WANTED--To exchange a half interest in buried treasure,      worth five million \\nfrancs, for transportation for one to an      unknown island in the Pacific and \\nfacilities for carrying      away the loot.   Ask for FOLLY, at Lavina\\'s. \\n \\nGrief looked at his watch. It was early yet, only eight o\\'clock. \\n \\n\"Mr. Carlsen,\" he called in the direction of a glowing pipe. \"Get the crew for the \\nwhale-boat. I\\'m going ashore.\" \\n \\nThe husky voice of the Norwegian mate was raised for\\'ard, and half a dozen \\nstrapping Rapa Islanders ceased their singing and manned the boat. \\n \\n\"I came to see Folly, Mr. Folly, I imagine,\" David Grief told Lavina. \\n \\nHe noted the quick interest in her eyes as she turned her head and flung a \\ncommand in native across two open rooms to the outstanding kitchen. A few \\nminutes later a barefooted native girl padded in and shook her head. \\n \\nLavina\\'s disappointment was evident. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n24 \\n\"You\\'re stopping aboard the Kittiwake, aren\\'t you?\" she said. \"I\\'ll tell him you \\ncalled.\" \\n \\n\"Then it is a he?\" Grief queried. \\n \\nLavina nodded. \\n \\n\"I hope you can do something for him, Captain Grief. I\\'m only a good-natured \\nwoman. I don\\'t know. But he\\'s a likable man, and he may be telling the truth; I \\ndon\\'t know. You\\'ll know. You\\'re not a soft-hearted fool like me. Can\\'t I mix you a \\ncocktail?\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nBack on board his schooner and dozing in a deck chair under a three-months-old \\nmagazine, David Grief was aroused by a sobbing, slubbering noise from overside. \\nHe opened his eyes. From the Chilian cruiser, a quarter of a mile away, came the \\nstroke of eight bells. It was midnight. From overside came a splash and another \\nslubbering noise. To him it seemed half amphibian, half the sounds of a man \\ncrying to himself and querulously chanting his sorrows to the general universe. \\n \\nA jump took David Grief to the low rail. Beneath, centred about the slubbering \\nnoise, was an area of agitated phosphorescence. Leaning over, he locked his hand \\nunder the armpit of a man, and, with pull and heave and quick-changing grips, \\nhe drew on deck the naked form of Aloysius Pankburn. \\n \\n\"I didn\\'t have a sou-markee,\" he complained. \"I had to swim it, and I couldn\\'t find \\nyour gangway. It was very miserable. Pardon me. If you have a towel to put about \\nmy middle, and a good stiff drink, I\\'ll be more myself. I\\'m Mr. Folly, and you\\'re \\nthe Captain Grief, I presume, who called on me when I was out. No, I\\'m not \\ndrunk. Nor am I cold. This isn\\'t shivering. Lavina allowed me only two drinks to-\\nday. I\\'m on the edge of the horrors, that\\'s all, and I was beginning to see things \\nwhen I couldn\\'t find the gangway. If you\\'ll take me below I\\'ll be very grateful. You \\nare the only one that answered my advertisement.\" \\n \\nHe was shaking pitiably in the warm night, and down in the cabin, before he got \\nhis towel, Grief saw to it that a half-tumbler of whiskey was in his hand. \\n \\n\"Now fire ahead,\" Grief said, when he had got his guest into a shirt and a pair of \\nduck trousers. \"What\\'s this advertisement of yours? I\\'m listening.\" \\n \\nPankburn looked at the whiskey bottle, but Grief shook his head. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n25 \\n\"All right, Captain, though I tell you on whatever is left of my honour that I am \\nnot drunk--not in the least. Also, what I shall tell you is true, and I shall tell it \\nbriefly, for it is clear to me that you are a man of affairs and action. Likewise, \\nyour chemistry is good. To you alcohol has never been a million maggots gnawing \\nat every cell of you. You\\'ve never been to hell. I am there now. I am scorching. \\nNow listen. \\n \\n\"My mother is alive. She is English. I was born in Australia. I was educated at \\nYork and Yale. I am a master of arts, a doctor of philosophy, and I am no good. \\nFurthermore, I am an alcoholic. I have been an athlete. I used to swan-dive a \\nhundred and ten feet in the clear. I hold several amateur records. I am a fish. I \\nlearned the crawl-stroke from the first of the Cavilles. I have done thirty miles in \\na rough sea. I have another record. I have punished more whiskey than any man \\nof my years. I will steal sixpence from you for the price of a drink. Finally, I will \\ntell you the truth. \\n \\n\"My father was an American--an Annapolis man. He was a midshipman in the \\nWar of the Rebellion. In \\'66 he was a lieutenant on the Suwanee. Her captain was \\nPaul Shirley. In \\'66 the Suwanee coaled at an island in the Pacific which I do not \\ncare to mention, under a protectorate which did not exist then and which shall be \\nnameless. Ashore, behind the bar of a public house, my father saw three copper \\nspikes--ship\\'s spikes.\" \\n \\nDavid Grief smiled quietly. \\n \\n\"And now I can tell you the name of the coaling station and of the protectorate \\nthat came afterward,\" he said. \\n \\n\"And of the three spikes?\" Pankburn asked with equal quietness. \"Go ahead, for \\nthey are in my possession now.\" \\n \\n\"Certainly. They were behind German Oscar\\'s bar at Peenoo-Peenee. Johnny \\nBlack brought them there from off his schooner the night he died. He was just \\nback from a long cruise to the westward, fishing beche-de-mer and sandalwood \\ntrading. All the beach knows the tale.\" \\n \\nPankburn shook his head. \\n \\n\"Go on,\" he urged. \\n \\n\"It was before my time, of course,\" Grief explained. \"I only tell what I\\'ve heard. \\nNext came the Ecuadoran cruiser, of all directions, in from the westward, and \\nbound home. Her officers recognized the spikes. Johnny Black was dead. They \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n26 \\ngot hold of his mate and logbook. Away to the westward went she. Six months \\nafter, again bound home, she dropped in at Peenoo-Peenee. She had failed, and \\nthe tale leaked out.\" \\n \\n\"When the revolutionists were marching on Guayaquil,\" Pankburn took it up, \"the \\nfederal officers, believing a defence of the city hopeless, salted down the \\ngovernment treasure chest, something like a million dollars gold, but all in \\nEnglish coinage, and put it on board the American schooner Flirt. They were \\ngoing to run at daylight. The American captain skinned out in the middle of the \\nnight. Go on.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s an old story,\" Grief resumed. \"There was no other vessel in the harbour. The \\nfederal leaders couldn\\'t run. They put their backs to the wall and held the city. \\nRohjas Salced, making a forced march from Quito, raised the siege. The \\nrevolution was broken, and the one ancient steamer that constituted the \\nEcuadoran navy was sent in pursuit of the Flirt. They caught her, between the \\nBanks Group and the New Hebrides, hove to and flying distress signals. The \\ncaptain had died the day before--blackwater fever.\" \\n \\n\"And the mate?\" Pankburn challenged. \\n \\n\"The mate had been killed a week earlier by the natives on one of the Banks, \\nwhen they sent a boat in for water. There were no navigators left. The men were \\nput to the torture. It was beyond international law. They wanted to confess, but \\ncouldn\\'t. They told of the three spikes in the trees on the beach, but where the \\nisland was they did not know. To the westward, far to the westward, was all they \\nknew. The tale now goes two ways. One is that they all died under the torture. \\nThe other is that the survivors were swung at the yardarm. At any rate, the \\nEcuadoran cruiser went home without the treasure. Johnny Black brought the \\nthree spikes to Peenoo-Peenee, and left them at German Oscar\\'s, but how and \\nwhere he found them he never told.\" \\n \\nPankburn looked hard at the whiskey bottle. \\n \\n\"Just two fingers,\" he whimpered. \\n \\nGrief considered, and poured a meagre drink. Pankburn\\'s eyes sparkled, and he \\ntook new lease of life. \\n \\n\"And this is where I come in with the missing details,\" he said. \"Johnny Black did \\ntell. He told my father. Wrote him from Levuka, before he came on to die at \\nPeenoo-Peenee. My father had saved his life one rough-house night in Valparaiso. \\nA Chink pearler, out of Thursday Island, prospecting for new grounds to the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n27 \\nnorth of New Guinea, traded for the three spikes with a nigger. Johnny Black \\nbought them for copper weight. He didn\\'t dream any more than the Chink, but \\ncoming back he stopped for hawksbill turtle at the very beach where you say the \\nmate of the Flirt was killed. Only he wasn\\'t killed. The Banks Islanders held him \\nprisoner, and he was dying of necrosis of the jawbone, caused by an arrow wound \\nin the fight on the beach. Before he died he told the yarn to Johnny Black. \\nJohnny Black wrote my father from Levuka. He was at the end of his rope--\\ncancer. My father, ten years afterward, when captain of the Perry, got the spikes \\nfrom German Oscar. And from my father, last will and testament, you know, \\ncame the spikes and the data. I have the island, the latitude and longitude of the \\nbeach where the three spikes were nailed in the trees. The spikes are up at \\nLavina\\'s now. The latitude and longitude are in my head. Now what do you \\nthink?\" \\n \\n\"Fishy,\" was Grief\\'s instant judgment. \"Why didn\\'t your father go and get it \\nhimself?\" \\n \\n\"Didn\\'t need it. An uncle died and left him a fortune. He retired from the navy, \\nran foul of an epidemic of trained nurses in Boston, and my mother got a divorce. \\nAlso, she fell heir to an income of something like thirty thousand dollars, and \\nwent to live in New Zealand. I was divided between them, half-time New Zealand, \\nhalf-time United States, until my father\\'s death last year. Now my mother has me \\naltogether. He left me his money--oh, a couple of millions--but my mother has \\nhad guardians appointed on account of the drink. I\\'m worth all kinds of money, \\nbut I can\\'t touch a penny save what is doled out to me. But the old man, who had \\ngot the tip on my drinking, left me the three spikes and the data thereunto \\npertaining. Did it through his lawyers, unknown to my mother; said it beat life \\ninsurance, and that if I had the backbone to go and get it I could drink my back \\nteeth awash until I died. Millions in the hands of my guardians, slathers of \\nshekels of my mother\\'s that\\'ll be mine if she beats me to the crematory, another \\nmillion waiting to be dug up, and in the meantime I\\'m cadging on Lavina for two \\ndrinks a day. It\\'s hell, isn\\'t it?--when you consider my thirst.\" \\n \\n\"Where\\'s the island?\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s a long way from here.\" \\n \\n\"Name it.\" \\n \\n\"Not on your life, Captain Grief. You\\'re making an easy half-million out of this. \\nYou will sail under my directions, and when we\\'re well to sea and on our way I\\'ll \\ntell you and not before.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n28 \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders, dismissing the subject. \\n \\n\"When I\\'ve given you another drink I\\'ll send the boat ashore with you,\" he said. \\n \\nPankburn was taken aback. For at least five minutes he debated with himself, \\nthen licked his lips and surrendered. \\n \\n\"If you promise to go, I\\'ll tell you now.\" \\n \\n\"Of course I\\'m willing to go. That\\'s why I asked you. Name the island.\" \\n \\nPankburn looked at the bottle. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll take that drink now, Captain.\" \\n \\n\"No you won\\'t. That drink was for you if you went ashore. If you are going to tell \\nme the island, you must do it in your sober senses.\" \\n \\n\"Francis Island, if you will have it. Bougainville named it Barbour Island.\" \\n \\n\"Off there all by its lonely in the Little Coral Sea,\" Grief said. \"I know it. Lies \\nbetween New Ireland and New Guinea. A rotten hole now, though it was all right \\nwhen the Flirt drove in the spikes and the Chink pearler traded for them. The \\nsteamship Castor, recruiting labour for the Upolu plantations, was cut off there \\nwith all hands two years ago. I knew her captain well. The Germans sent a \\ncruiser, shelled the bush, burned half a dozen villages, killed a couple of niggers \\nand a lot of pigs, and--and that was all. The niggers always were bad there, but \\nthey turned really bad forty years ago. That was when they cut off a whaler. Let \\nme see? What was her name?\" \\n \\nHe stepped to the bookshelf, drew out the bulky \"South Pacific Directory,\" and \\nran through its pages. \\n \\n\"Yes. Here it is. Francis, or Barbour,\" he skimmed. \"Natives warlike and \\ntreacherous--Melanesian--cannibals. Whaleship Western cut off--that was her \\nname. Shoals--points--anchorages--ah, Redscar, Owen Bay, Likikili Bay, that\\'s \\nmore like it; deep indentation, mangrove swamps, good holding in nine fathoms \\nwhen white scar in bluff bears west-southwest.\" Grief looked up. \"That\\'s your \\nbeach, Pankburn, I\\'ll swear.\" \\n \\n\"Will you go?\" the other demanded eagerly. \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n29 \\n \\n\"It sounds good to me. Now if the story had been of a hundred millions, or some \\nsuch crazy sum, I wouldn\\'t look at it for a moment. We\\'ll sail to-morrow, but \\nunder one consideration. You are to be absolutely under my orders.\" \\n \\nHis visitor nodded emphatically and joyously. \\n \\n\"And that means no drink.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s pretty hard,\" Pankburn whined. \\n \\n\"It\\'s my terms.

You\\'ll stand regular watches and everything, \\nthough you eat and sleep aft with us.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s a go.\" Pankburn put out his hand to ratify the agreement. \"If it doesn\\'t kill \\nme,\" he added. \\n \\nDavid Grief poured a generous three-fingers into the tumbler and extended it. \\n \\n\"Then here\\'s your last drink. Take it.\" \\n \\nPankburn\\'s hand went halfway out. With a sudden spasm of resolution, he \\nhesitated, threw back his shoulders, and straightened up his head. \\n \\n\"I guess I won\\'t,\" he began, then, feebly surrendering to the gnaw of desire, he \\nreached hastily for the glass, as if in fear that it would be withdrawn.  \\nIV \\n \\nIt is a long traverse from Papeete in the Societies to the Little Coral Sea--from 100 \\nwest longitude to 150 east longitude--as the crow flies the equivalent to a voyage \\nacross the Atlantic. But the Kittiwake did not go as the crow flies. David Grief\\'s \\nnumerous interests diverted her course many times. He stopped to take a look-in \\nat uninhabited Rose Island with an eye to colonizing and planting cocoa-nuts. \\nNext, he paid his respects to Tui Manua, of Eastern Samoa, and opened an \\nintrigue for a share of the trade monopoly of that dying king\\'s three islands. From \\nApia he carried several relief agents and a load of trade goods to the Gilberts. He \\npeeped in at Ontong-Java Atoll, inspected his plantations on Ysabel, and \\npurchased lands from the salt-water chiefs of northwestern Malaita. And all along \\nthis devious way he made a man of Aloysius Pankburn. \\n \\nThat thirster, though he lived aft, was compelled to do the work of a common \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n30 \\nsailor. And not only did he take his wheel and lookout, and heave on sheets and \\ntackles, but the dirtiest and most arduous tasks were appointed him. Swung aloft \\nin a bosun\\'s chair, he scraped the masts and slushed down. Holystoning the deck \\nor scrubbing it with fresh limes made his back ache and developed the wasted, \\nflabby muscles. When the Kittiwake lay at anchor and her copper bottom was \\nscrubbed with cocoa-nut husks by the native crew, who dived and did it under \\nwater, Pankburn was sent down on his shift and as many times as any on the \\nshift. \\n \\n\"Look at yourself,\" Grief said. \"You are twice the man you were when you came on \\nboard. You haven\\'t had one drink, you didn\\'t die, and the poison is pretty well \\nworked out of you. It\\'s the work. It beats trained nurses and business managers. \\nHere, if you\\'re thirsty. Clap your lips to this.\" \\n \\nWith several deft strokes of his heavy-backed sheath-knife, Grief clipped a \\ntriangular piece of shell from the end of a husked drinking-cocoa-nut. The thin, \\ncool liquid, slightly milky and effervescent, bubbled to the brim. With a bow, \\nPankburn took the natural cup, threw his head back, and held it back till the \\nshell was empty. He drank many of these nuts each day. The black steward, a \\nNew Hebrides boy sixty years of age, and his assistant, a Lark Islander of eleven, \\nsaw to it that he was continually supplied. \\n \\nPankburn did not object to the hard work. He devoured work, never shirking and \\nalways beating the native sailors in jumping to obey a command. But his \\nsufferings during the period of driving the alcohol out of his system were truly \\nheroic. Even when the last shred of the poison was exuded, the desire, as an \\nobsession, remained in his head. So it was, when, on his honour, he went ashore \\nat Apia, that he attempted to put the public houses out of business by drinking \\nup their stocks in trade. And so it was, at two in the morning, that David Grief \\nfound him in front of the Tivoli, out of which he had been disorderly thrown by \\nCharley Roberts. Aloysius, as of old, was chanting his sorrows to the stars. Also, \\nand more concretely, he was punctuating the rhythm with cobbles of coral stone, \\nwhich he flung with amazing accuracy through Charley Roberts\\'s windows. \\n \\nDavid Grief took him away, but not till next morning did he take him in hand. It \\nwas on the deck of the Kittiwake, and there was nothing kindergarten about it. \\nGrief struck him, with bare knuckles, punched him and punished him--gave him \\nthe worst thrashing he had ever received. \\n \\n\"For the good of your soul, Pankburn,\" was the way he emphasized his blows. \\n\"For the good of your mother. For the progeny that will come after. For the good of \\nthe world, and the universe, and the whole race of man yet to be. And now, to \\nhammer the lesson home, we\\'ll do it all over again. That, for the good of your \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n31 \\nsoul; and that, for your mother\\'s sake; and that, for the little children, \\nundreamed of and unborn, whose mother you\\'ll love for their sakes, and for love\\'s \\nsake, in the lease of manhood that will be yours when I am done with you. Come \\non and take your medicine. I\\'m not done with you yet. I\\'ve only begun. There are \\nmany other reasons which I shall now proceed to expound.\" The brown sailors \\nand the black stewards and cook looked on and grinned. Far from them was the \\nquestioning of any of the mysterious and incomprehensible ways of white men. As \\nfor Carlsen, the mate, he was grimly in accord with the treatment his employer \\nwas administering; while Albright, the supercargo, merely played with his \\nmustache and smiled. They were men of the sea. They lived life in the rough. And \\nalcohol, in themselves as well as in other men, was a problem they had learned to \\nhandle in ways not taught in doctors\\' schools. \\n \\n\"Boy! A bucket of fresh water and a towel,\" Grief ordered, when he had finished. \\n\"Two buckets and two towels,\" he added, as he surveyed his own hands. \\n \\n\"You\\'re a pretty one,\" he said to Pankburn. \"You\\'ve spoiled everything. I had the \\npoison completely out of you. And now you are fairly reeking with it. We\\'ve got to \\nbegin all over again. Mr. Albright! You know that pile of old chain on the beach at \\nthe boat-landing. Find the owner, buy it, and fetch it on board. There must be a \\nhundred and fifty fathoms of it. Pankburn! To-morrow morning you start in \\npounding the rust off of it. When you\\'ve done that, you\\'ll sandpaper it. Then you\\'ll \\npaint it. And nothing else will you do till that chain is as smooth as new.\" \\n \\nAloysius Pankburn shook his head. \\n \\n\"I quit. Francis Island can go to hell for all of me. I\\'m done with your slave-\\ndriving. Kindly put me ashore at once. I\\'m a white man. You can\\'t treat me this \\nway.\" \\n \\n\"Mr. Carlsen, you will see that Mr. Pankburn remains on board.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ll have you broken for this!\" Aloysius screamed. \"You can\\'t stop me.\" \\n \\n\"I can give you another licking,\" Grief answered. \"And let me tell you one thing, \\nyou besotted whelp, I\\'ll keep on licking you as long as my knuckles hold out or \\nuntil you yearn to hammer chain rust. I\\'ve taken you in hand, and I\\'m going to \\nmake a man out of you if I have to kill you to do it. Now go below and change \\nyour clothes. Be ready to turn to with a hammer this afternoon. Mr. Albright, get \\nthat chain aboard pronto. Mr. Carlsen, send the boats ashore after it. Also, keep \\nyour eye on Pankburn. If he shows signs of keeling over or going into the shakes, \\ngive him a nip--a small one. He may need it after last night.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n32 \\nV \\n \\nFor the rest of the time the Kittiwake lay in Apia Aloysius Pankburn pounded \\nchain rust. Ten hours a day he pounded. And on the long stretch across to the \\nGilberts he still pounded. \\n \\nThen came the sandpapering. One hundred and fifty fathoms is nine hundred \\nfeet, and every link of all that length was smoothed and polished as no link ever \\nwas before. And when the last link had received its second coat of black paint, he \\ndeclared himself. \\n \\n\"Come on with more dirty work,\" he told Grief. \"I\\'ll overhaul the other chains if \\nyou say so. And you needn\\'t worry about me any more. I\\'m not going to take \\nanother drop. I\\'m going to train up. You got my proud goat when you beat me, \\nbut let me tell you, you only got it temporarily. Train! I\\'m going to train till I\\'m as \\nhard all the way through, and clean all the way through, as that chain is. And \\nsome day, Mister David Grief, somewhere, somehow, I\\'m going to be in such \\nshape that I\\'ll lick you as you licked me. I\\'m going to pulp your face till your own \\nniggers won\\'t know you.\" \\n \\nGrief was jubilant. \\n \\n\"Now you\\'re talking like a man,\" he cried. \"The only way you\\'ll ever lick me is to \\nbecome a man. And then, maybe--\" \\n \\nHe paused in the hope that the other would catch the suggestion. Aloysius groped \\nfor it, and, abruptly, something akin to illumination shone in his eyes. \\n \\n\"And then I won\\'t want to, you mean?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"And that\\'s the curse of it,\" Aloysius lamented. \"I really believe I won\\'t want to. I \\nsee the point. But I\\'m going to go right on and shape myself up just the same.\" \\n \\nThe warm, sunburn glow in Grief\\'s face seemed to grow warmer. His hand went \\nout. \\n \\n\"Pankburn, I love you right now for that.\" \\n \\nAloysius grasped the hand, and shook his head in sad sincerity. \\n \\n\"Grief,\" he mourned, \"you\\'ve got my goat, you\\'ve got my proud goat, and you\\'ve \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n33 \\ngot it permanently, I\\'m afraid.\" \\n \\nVI \\n \\nOn a sultry tropic day, when the last flicker of the far southeast trade was fading \\nout and the seasonal change for the northwest monsoon was coming on, the \\nKittiwake lifted above the sea-rim the jungle-clad coast of Francis Island. \\n \\nGrief, with compass bearings and binoculars, identified the volcano that marked \\nRedscar, ran past Owen Bay, and lost the last of the breeze at the entrance to \\nLikikili Bay. With the two whaleboats out and towing, and with Carl-sen heaving \\nthe lead, the Kittiwake sluggishly entered a deep and narrow indentation. There \\nwere no beaches. The mangroves began at the water\\'s edge, and behind them rose \\nsteep jungle, broken here and there by jagged peaks of rock. At the end of a mile, \\nwhen the white scar on the bluff bore west-southwest, the lead vindicated the \\n\"Directory,\" and the anchor rumbled down in nine fathoms. \\n \\nFor the rest of that day and until the afternoon of the day following they remained \\non the Kittiwake and waited. No canoes appeared. There were no signs of human \\nlife. Save for the occasional splash of a fish or the screaming of cockatoos, there \\nseemed no other life. Once, however, a huge butterfly, twelve inches from tip to \\ntip, fluttered high over their mastheads and drifted across to the opposing jungle. \\n \\n\"There\\'s no use in sending a boat in to be cut up,\" Grief said. \\n \\nPankburn was incredulous, and volunteered to go in alone, to swim it if he \\ncouldn\\'t borrow the dingey. \\n \\n\"They haven\\'t forgotten the German cruiser,\" Grief explained. \"And I\\'ll wager that \\nbush is alive with men right now. What do you think, Mr. Carlsen?\" \\n \\nThat veteran adventurer of the islands was emphatic in his agreement. \\n \\nIn the late afternoon of the second day Grief ordered a whaleboat into the water. \\nHe took his place in the bow, a live cigarette in his mouth and a short-fused stick \\nof dynamite in his hand, for he was bent on shooting a mess of fish. Along the \\nthwarts half a dozen Winchesters were placed. Albright, who took the steering-\\nsweep, had a Mauser within reach of hand. They pulled in and along the green \\nwall of vegetation. At times they rested on the oars in the midst of a profound \\nsilence. \\n \\n\"Two to one the bush is swarming with them--in quids,\" Albright whispered. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n34 \\nPankburn listened a moment longer and took the bet. Five minutes later they \\nsighted a school of mullet. The brown rowers held their oars. Grief touched the \\nshort fuse to his cigarette and threw the stick. So short was the fuse that the \\nstick exploded in the instant after it struck the water. And in that same instant \\nthe bush exploded into life. There were wild yells of defiance, and black and \\nnaked bodies leaped forward like apes through the mangroves. \\n \\nIn the whaleboat every rifle was lifted. Then came the wait. A hundred blacks, \\nsome few armed with ancient Sniders, but the greater portion armed with \\ntomahawks, fire-hardened spears, and bone-tipped arrows, clustered on the roots \\nthat rose out of the bay. No word was spoken. Each party watched the other \\nacross twenty feet of water. An old, one-eyed black, with a bristly face, rested a \\nSnider on his hip, the muzzle directed at Albright, who, in turn, covered him back \\nwith the Mauser. A couple of minutes of this tableau endured. The stricken fish \\nrose to the surface or struggled half-stunned in the clear depths. \\n \\n\"It\\'s all right, boys,\" Grief said quietly. \"Put down your guns and over the side \\nwith you. Mr. Albright, toss the tobacco to that one-eyed brute.\" \\n \\nWhile the Rapa men dived for the fish, Albright threw a bundle of trade tobacco \\nashore. The one-eyed man nodded his head and writhed his features in an \\nattempt at amiability. Weapons were lowered, bows unbent, and arrows put back \\nin their quivers. \\n \\n\"They know tobacco,\" Grief announced, as they rowed back aboard. \"We\\'ll have \\nvisitors. You\\'ll break out a case of tobacco, Mr. Albright, and a few trade-knives. \\nThere\\'s a canoe now.\" \\n \\nOld One-Eye, as befitted a chief and leader, paddled out alone, facing peril for the \\nrest of the tribe. As Carlsen leaned over the rail to help the visitor up, he turned \\nhis head and remarked casually: \\n \\n\"They\\'ve dug up the money, Mr. Grief. The old beggar\\'s loaded with it.\" \\n \\nOne-Eye floundered down on deck, grinning appeasingly and failing to hide the \\nfear he had overcome but which still possessed him. He was lame of one leg, and \\nthis was accounted for by a terrible scar, inches deep, which ran down the thigh \\nfrom hip to knee. No clothes he wore whatever, not even a string, but his nose, \\nperforated in a dozen places and each perforation the setting for a carved spine of \\nbone, bristled like a porcupine. Around his neck and hanging down on his dirty \\nchest was a string of gold sovereigns. His ears were hung with silver half-crowns, \\nand from the cartilage separating his nostrils depended a big English penny, \\ntarnished and green, but unmistakable. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n35 \\n \\n\"Hold on, Grief,\" Pankburn said, with perfectly assumed carelessness. \"You say \\nthey know only beads and tobacco. Very well. You follow my lead. They\\'ve found \\nthe treasure, and we\\'ve got to trade them out of it. Get the whole crew aside and \\nlecture them that they are to be interested only in the pennies. Savve? Gold coins \\nmust be beneath contempt, and silver coins merely tolerated. Pennies are to be \\nthe only desirable things.\" \\n \\nPankburn took charge of the trading. For the penny in One-Eye\\'s nose he gave \\nten sticks of tobacco. Since each stick cost David Grief a cent, the bargain was \\nmanifestly unfair. But for the half-crowns Pankburn gave only one stick each. \\nThe string of sovereigns he refused to consider. The more he refused, the more \\nOne-Eye insisted on a trade. At last, with an appearance of irritation and anger, \\nand as a palpable concession, Pankburn gave two sticks for the string, which was \\ncomposed of ten sovereigns. \\n \\n\"I take my hat off to you,\" Grief said to Pankburn that night at dinner. \"The \\nsituation is patent. You\\'ve reversed the scale of value. They\\'ll figure the pennies \\nas priceless possessions and the sovereigns as beneath price. Result: they\\'ll hang \\non to the pennies and force us to trade for sovereigns. Pankburn, I drink your \\nhealth! Boy!--another cup of tea for Mr. Pankburn.\" \\n \\nVII \\n \\nFollowed a golden week. From dawn till dark a row of canoes rested on their \\npaddles two hundred feet away. This was the deadline. Rapa sailors, armed with \\nrifles, maintained it. But one canoe at a time was permitted alongside, and but \\none black at a time was permitted to come over the rail. Here, under the awning, \\nrelieving one another in hourly shifts, the four white men carried on the trade. \\nThe rate of exchange was that established by Pankburn with One-Eye. Five \\nsovereigns fetched a stick of tobacco; a hundred sovereigns, twenty sticks. Thus, \\na crafty-eyed cannibal would deposit on the table a thousand dollars in gold, and \\ngo back over the rail, hugely-satisfied, with forty cents\\' worth of tobacco in his \\nhand. \\n \\n\"Hope we\\'ve got enough tobacco to hold out,\" Carlsen muttered dubiously, as \\nanother case was sawed in half. \\n \\nAlbright laughed. \\n \\n\"We\\'ve got fifty cases below,\" he said, \"and as I figure it, three cases buy a \\nhundred thousand dollars. There was only a million dollars buried, so thirty \\ncases ought to get it. Though, of course, we\\'ve got to allow a margin for the silver \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n36 \\nand the pennies. That Ecuadoran bunch must have salted down all the coin in \\nsight.\" \\n \\nVery few pennies and shillings appeared, though Pankburn continually and \\nanxiously inquired for them. Pennies were the one thing he seemed to desire, and \\nhe made his eyes flash covetously whenever one was produced. True to his \\ntheory, the savages concluded that the gold, being of slight value, must be \\ndisposed of first. A penny, worth fifty times as much as a sovereign, was \\nsomething to retain and treasure. Doubtless, in their jungle-lairs, the wise old \\ngray-beards put their heads together and agreed to raise the price on pennies \\nwhen the worthless gold was all worked off. Who could tell? Mayhap the strange \\nwhite men could be made to give even twenty sticks for a priceless copper. \\n \\nBy the end of the week the trade went slack. There was only the slightest dribble \\nof gold. An occasional penny was reluctantly disposed of for ten sticks, while \\nseveral thousand dollars in silver came in. \\n \\nOn the morning of the eighth day no trading was done. The gray-beards had \\nmatured their plan and were demanding twenty sticks for a penny, One-Eye \\ndelivered the new rate of exchange. The white men appeared to take it with great \\nseriousness, for they stood together debating in low voices. Had One-Eye \\nunderstood English he would have been enlightened. \\n \\n\"We\\'ve got just a little over eight hundred thousand, not counting the silver,\" Grief \\nsaid. \"And that\\'s about all there is. The bush tribes behind have most probably \\ngot the other two hundred thousand. Return in three months, and the salt-water \\ncrowd will have traded back for it; also they will be out of tobacco by that time.\" \\n \\n\"It would be a sin to buy pennies,\" Albright grinned. \"It goes against the thrifty \\ngrain of my trader\\'s soul.\" \\n \\n\"There\\'s a whiff of land-breeze stirring,\" Grief said, looking at Pankburn. \"What do \\nyou say?\" \\n \\nPankburn nodded. \\n \\n\"Very well.\" Grief measured the faintness and irregularity of the wind against his \\ncheek. \\n \\n\"Mr. Carlsen, heave short, and get off the gaskets. And stand by with the \\nwhaleboats to tow. This breeze is not dependable.\" \\n \\nHe picked up a part case of tobacco, containing six or seven hundred sticks, put \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n37 \\nit in One-Eye\\'s hands, and helped that bewildered savage over the rail. As the \\nforesail went up the mast, a wail of consternation arose from the canoes lying \\nalong the dead-line. And as the anchor broke out and the Kittiwake\\'s head paid \\noff in the light breeze, old One-Eye, daring the rifles levelled on him, paddled \\nalongside and made frantic signs of his tribe\\'s willingness to trade pennies for ten \\nsticks. \\n \\n\"Boy!--a drinking nut,\" Pankburn called. \\n \\n\"It\\'s Sydney Heads for you,\" Grief said. \"And then what?\" \\n \\n\"I\\'m coming back with you for that two hundred thousand,\" Pankburn answered. \\n\"In the meantime I\\'m going to build an island schooner. Also, I\\'m going to call \\nthose guardians of mine before the court to show cause why my father\\'s money \\nshould not be turned over to me. Show cause? I\\'ll show them cause why it \\nshould.\" \\n \\nHe swelled his biceps proudly under the thin sleeve, reached for the two black \\nstewards, and put them above his head like a pair of dumbbells. \\n \\n\"Come on! Swing out on that fore-boom-tackle!\" Carlsen shouted from aft, where \\nthe mainsail was being winged out. \\n \\nPankburn dropped the stewards and raced for it, beating a Rapa sailor by two \\njumps to the hauling part. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n38 \\n \\nChapter Three--THE DEVILS OF FUATINO \\n \\n I \\n \\nOf his many schooners, ketches and cutters that nosed about among the coral \\nisles of the South Seas, David Grief loved most the Rattler--a yacht-like schooner \\nof ninety tons with so swift a pair of heels that she had made herself famous, in \\nthe old days, opium-smuggling from San Diego to Puget Sound, raiding the seal-\\nrookeries of Bering Sea, and running arms in the Far East. A stench and an \\nabomination to government officials, she had been the joy of all sailormen, and \\nthe pride of the shipwrights who built her. Even now, after forty years of driving, \\nshe was still the same old Rattler, fore-reaching in the same marvellous manner \\nthat compelled sailors to see in order to believe and that punctuated many an \\nangry discussion with words and blows on the beaches of all the ports from \\nValparaiso to Manila Bay. \\n \\nOn this night, close-hauled, her big mainsail preposterously flattened down, her \\nluffs pulsing emptily on the lift of each smooth swell, she was sliding an easy four \\nknots through the water on the veriest whisper of a breeze. For an hour David \\nGrief had been leaning on the rail at the lee fore-rigging, gazing overside at the \\nsteady phosphorescence of her gait. The faint back-draught from the headsails \\nfanned his cheek and chest with a wine of coolness, and he was in an ecstasy of \\nappreciation of the schooner\\'s qualities. \\n \\n\"Eh!--She\\'s a beauty, Taute, a beauty,\" he said to the Kanaka lookout, at the \\nsame time stroking the teak of the rail with an affectionate hand. \\n \\n\"Ay, skipper,\" the Kanaka answered in the rich, big-chested tones of Polynesia. \\n\"Thirty years I know ships, but never like \\'this. On Raiatea we call her Fanauao.\" \\n \\n\"The Dayborn,\" Grief translated the love-phrase. \"Who named her so?\" \\n \\nAbout to answer, Taute peered ahead with sudden intensity. Grief joined him in \\nthe gaze. \\n \\n\"Land,\" said Taute. \\n \\n\"Yes; Fuatino,\" Grief agreed, his eyes still fixed on the spot where the star-\\nluminous horizon was gouged by a blot of blackness. \"It\\'s all right. I\\'ll tell the \\ncaptain.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n39 \\nThe Rattler slid along until the loom of the island could be seen as well as sensed, \\nuntil the sleepy roar of breakers and the blatting of goats could be heard, until \\nthe wind, off the land, was flower-drenched with perfume. \\n \\n\"If it wasn\\'t a crevice, she could run the passage a night like this,\" Captain Glass \\nremarked regretfully, as he watched the wheel lashed hard down by the \\nsteersman. \\n \\nThe Rattler, run off shore a mile, had been hove to to wait until daylight ere she \\nattempted the perilous entrance to Fuatino. It was a perfect tropic night, with no \\nhint of rain or squall. For\\'ard, wherever their tasks left them, the Raiatea sailors \\nsank down to sleep on deck. Aft, the captain and mate and Grief spread their \\nbeds with similar languid unconcern. They lay on their blankets, smoking and \\nmurmuring sleepy conjectures about Mataara, the Queen of Fuatino, and about \\nthe love affair between her daughter, Naumoo, and Motuaro. \\n \\n\"They\\'re certainly a romantic lot,\" Brown, the mate, said. \"As romantic as we \\nwhites.\" \\n \\n\"As romantic as Pilsach,\" Grief laughed, \"and that is going some. How long ago \\nwas it, Captain, that he jumped you?\" \\n \\n\"Eleven years,\" Captain Glass grunted resentfully. \\n \\n\"Tell me about it,\" Brown pleaded. \"They say he\\'s never left Fuatino since. Is that \\nright?\" \\n \\n\"Right O,\" the captain rumbled. \"He\\'s in love with his wife--the little hussy! Stole \\nhim from me, and as good a sailorman as the trade has ever seen--if he is a \\nDutchman.\" \\n \\n\"German,\" Grief corrected. \\n \\n\"It\\'s all the same,\" was the retort. \"The sea was robbed of a good man that night \\nhe went ashore and Notutu took one look at him. I reckon they looked good to \\neach other. Before you could say skat, she\\'d put a wreath of some kind of white \\nflowers on his head, and in five minutes they were off down the beach, like a \\ncouple of kids, holding hands and laughing. I hope he\\'s blown that big coral \\npatch out of the channel. I always start a sheet or two of copper warping past.\" \\n \\n\"Go on with the story,\" Brown urged. \\n \\n\"That\\'s all. He was finished right there. Got married that night. Never came on \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n40 \\nboard again. I looked him up next day. Found him in a straw house in the bush, \\nbarelegged, a white savage, all mixed up with flowers and things and playing a \\nguitar. Looked like a bally ass. Told me to send his things ashore. I told him I\\'d \\nsee him damned first. And that\\'s all. You\\'ll see her to-morrow. They\\'ve got three \\nkiddies now--wonderful little rascals. I\\'ve a phonograph down below for him, and \\nabout a million records.\" \\n \\n\"And then you made him trader?\" the mate inquired of Grief. \\n \\n\"What else could I do? Fuatino is a love island, and Filsach is a lover. He knows \\nthe native, too--one of the best traders I\\'ve got, or ever had. He\\'s responsible. \\nYou\\'ll see him to-morrow.\" \\n \\n\"Look here, young man,\" Captain Glass rumbled threateningly at his mate. \"Are \\nyou romantic? Because if you are, on board you stay. Fuatino\\'s the island of \\nromantic insanity. Everybody\\'s in love with somebody. They live on love. It\\'s in \\nthe milk of the cocoa-nuts, or the air, or the sea. The history of the island for the \\nlast ten thousand years is nothing but love affairs. I know. I\\'ve talked with the old \\nmen. And if I catch you starting down the beach hand in hand--\" \\n \\nHis sudden cessation caused both the other men to look at him. They followed his \\ngaze, which passed across them to the main rigging, and saw what he saw, a \\nbrown hand and arm, muscular and wet, being joined from overside by a second \\nbrown hand and arm. A head followed, thatched with long elfin locks, and then a \\nface, with roguish black eyes, lined with the marks of wildwood\\'s laughter. \\n \\n\"My God!\" Brown breathed. \"It\\'s a faun--a sea-faun.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s the Goat Man,\" said Glass. \\n \\n\"It is Mauriri,\" said Grief. \"He is my own blood brother by sacred plight of native \\ncustom. His name is mine, and mine is his.\" \\n \\nBroad brown shoulders and a magnificent chest rose above the rail, and, with \\nwhat seemed effortless ease, the whole grand body followed over the rail and \\nnoiselessly trod the deck. Brown, who might have been other things than the \\nmate of an island schooner, was enchanted. All that he had ever gleaned from the \\nbooks proclaimed indubitably the faun-likeness of this visitant of the deep. \"But a \\nsad faun,\" was the young man\\'s judgment, as the golden-brown woods god strode \\nforward to where David Grief sat up with outstretched hand. \\n \\n\"David,\" said David Grief. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n41 \\n\"Mauriri, Big Brother,\" said Mauriri. \\n \\nAnd thereafter, in the custom of men who have pledged blood brotherhood, each \\ncalled the other, not by the other\\'s name, but by his own. Also, they talked in the \\nPolynesian tongue of Fuatino, and Brown could only sit and guess. \\n \\n\"A long swim to say talofa,\" Grief said, as the other sat and streamed water on the \\ndeck. \\n \\n\"Many days and nights have I watched for your coming, Big Brother,\" Mauriri \\nreplied. \"I have sat on the Big Rock, where the dynamite is kept, of which I have \\nbeen made keeper. I saw you come up to the entrance and run back into \\ndarkness. I knew you waited till morning, and I followed. Great trouble has come \\nupon us. Mataara has cried these many days for your coming. She is an old \\nwoman, and Motauri is dead, and she is sad.\" \\n \\n\"Did he marry Naumoo?\" Grief asked, after he had shaken his head and sighed by \\nthe custom. \\n \\n\"Yes. In the end they ran to live with the goats, till Mataara forgave, when they \\nreturned to live with her in the Big House. But he is now dead, and Naumoo soon \\nwill die. Great is our trouble, Big Brother. Tori is dead, and Tati-Tori, and Petoo, \\nand Nari, and Pilsach, and others.\" \\n \\n\"Pilsach, too!\" Grief exclaimed. \"Has there been a sickness?\" \\n \\n\"There has been much killing. Listen, Big Brother, Three weeks ago a strange \\nschooner came. From the Big Rock I saw her topsails above the sea. She towed in \\nwith her boats, but they did not warp by the big patch, and she pounded many \\ntimes. She is now on the beach, where they are strengthening the broken timbers. \\nThere are eight white men on board. They have women from some island far to \\nthe east. The women talk a language in many ways like ours, only different. But \\nwe can understand. They say they were stolen by the men on the schooner. We \\ndo not know, but they sing and dance and are happy.\" \\n \\n\"And the men?\" Grief interrupted. \\n \\n\"They talk French. I know, for there was a mate on your schooner who talked \\nFrench long ago. There are two chief men, and they do not look like the others. \\nThey have blue eyes like you, and they are devils. One is a bigger devil than the \\nother. The other six are also devils. They do not pay us for our yams, and taro, \\nand breadfruit. They take everything from us, and if we complain they kill us. \\nThus was killed Tori, and Tati-Tori, and Petoo, and others. We cannot fight, for \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n42 \\nwe have no guns--only two or three old guns. \\n \\n\"They ill-treat our women. Thus was killed Motuaro, who made defence of \\nNaumoo, whom they have now taken on board their schooner. It was because of \\nthis that Pilsach was killed. Him the chief of the two chief men, the Big Devil, \\nshot once in his whaleboat, and twice when he tried to crawl up the sand of the \\nbeach. Pilsach was a brave man, and Notutu now sits in the house and cries \\nwithout end. Many of the people are afraid, and have run to live with the goats. \\nBut there is not food for all in the high mountains. And the men will not go out \\nand fish, and they work no more in the gardens because of the devils who take all \\nthey have. And we are ready to fight. \\n \\n\"Big Brother, we need guns, and much ammunition. I sent word before I swam \\nout to you, and the men are waiting. The strange white men do not know you are \\ncome. Give me a boat, and the guns, and I will go back before the sun. And when \\nyou come to-morrow we will be ready for the word from you to kill the strange \\nwhite men. They must be killed. Big Brother, you have ever been of the blood with \\nus, and the men and women have prayed to many gods for your coming. And you \\nare come.\" \\n \\n\"I will go in the boat with you,\" Grief said. \\n \\n\"No, Big Brother,\" was Mauriri\\'s reply. \"You must be with the schooner. The \\nstrange white men will fear the schooner, not us. We will have the guns, and they \\nwill not know. It is only when they see your schooner come that they will be \\nalarmed. Send the young man there with the boat.\" \\n \\nSo it was that Brown, thrilling with all the romance and adventure he had read \\nand guessed and never lived, took his place in the sternsheets of a whaleboat, \\nloaded with rifles and cartridges, rowed by four Baiatea sailors, steered by a \\ngolden-brown, sea-swimming faun, and directed through the warm tropic \\ndarkness toward the half-mythical love island of Fuatino, which had been \\ninvaded by twentieth century pirates. \\n \\nII \\n \\nIf a line be drawn between Jaluit, in the Marshall Group, and Bougainville, in the \\nSolomons, and if this line be bisected at two degrees south of the equator by a \\nline drawn from Ukuor, in the Carolines, the high island of Fuatino will be raised \\nin that sun-washed stretch of lonely sea. Inhabited by a stock kindred to the \\nHawaiian, the Samoan, the Tahitian, and the Maori, Fuatino becomes the apex of \\nthe wedge driven by Polynesia far to the west and in between Melanesia and \\nMicronesia. And it was Fuatino that David Grief raised next morning, two miles to \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n43 \\nthe east and in direct line with the rising sun. The same whisper of a breeze held, \\nand the Rattler slid through the smooth sea at a rate that would have been \\neminently proper for an island schooner had the breeze been thrice as strong. \\n \\nFuatino was nothing else than an ancient crater, thrust upward from the sea-\\nbottom by some primordial cataclysm. The western portion, broken and crumbled \\nto sea level, was the entrance to the crater itself, which constituted the harbour. \\nThus, Fuatino was like a rugged horseshoe, the heel pointing to the west. And \\ninto the opening at the heel the Rattler steered. Captain Glass, binoculars in \\nhand and peering at the chart made by himself, which was spread on top the \\ncabin, straightened up with an expression on his face that was half alarm, half \\nresignation. \\n \\n\"It\\'s coming,\" he said. \"Fever. It wasn\\'t due till to-morrow. It always hits me hard, \\nMr. Grief. In five minutes I\\'ll be off my head. You\\'ll have to con the schooner in. \\nBoy! Get my bunk ready! Plenty of blankets! Fill that hot-water bottle! It\\'s so \\ncalm, Mr. Grief, that I think you can pass the big patch without warping. Take \\nthe leading wind and shoot her. She\\'s the only craft in the South Pacific that can \\ndo it, and I know you know the trick. You can scrape the Big Rock by just \\nwatching out for the main boom.\" \\n \\nHe had talked rapidly, almost like a drunken man, as his reeling brain battled \\nwith the rising shock of the malarial stroke. When he stumbled toward the \\ncompanionway, his face was purpling and mottling as if attacked by some \\nmonstrous inflammation or decay. His eyes were setting in a glassy bulge, his \\nhands shaking, his teeth clicking in the spasms of chill. \\n \\n\"Two hours to get the sweat,\" he chattered with a ghastly grin. \"And a couple \\nmore and I\\'ll be all right. I know the damned thing to the last minute it runs its \\ncourse. Y-y-you t-t-take ch-ch-ch-ch----\" \\n \\nHis voice faded away in a weak stutter as he collapsed down into the cabin and \\nhis employer took charge. The Rattler was just entering the passage. The heels of \\nthe horseshoe island were two huge mountains of rock a thousand feet high, each \\nalmost broken off from the mainland and connected with it by a low and narrow \\npeninsula. Between the heels was a half-mile stretch, all but blocked by a reef of \\ncoral extending across from the south heel. The passage, which Captain Glass \\nhad called a crevice, twisted into this reef, curved directly to the north heel, and \\nran along the base of the perpendicular rock. At this point, with the main-boom \\nalmost grazing the rock on the port side, Grief, peering down on the starboard \\nside, could see bottom less than two fathoms beneath and shoaling steeply. With \\na whaleboat towing for steerage and as a precaution against back-draughts from \\nthe cliff, and taking advantage of a fan of breeze, he shook the Rattler full into it \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n44 \\nand glided by the big coral patch without warping. As it was, he just scraped, but \\nso softly as not to start the copper. \\n \\nThe harbour of Fuatino opened before him. It was a circular sheet of water, five \\nmiles in diameter, rimmed with white coral beaches, from which the verdure-clad \\nslopes rose swiftly to the frowning crater walls. The crests of the walls were saw-\\ntoothed, volcanic peaks, capped and halo\\'d with captive trade-wind clouds. Every \\nnook and crevice of the disintegrating lava gave foothold to creeping, climbing \\nvines and trees--a green foam of vegetation. Thin streams of water, that were \\nmere films of mist, swayed and undulated downward in sheer descents of \\nhundreds of feet. And to complete the magic of the place, the warm, moist air was \\nheavy with the perfume of the yellow-blossomed cassi. \\n \\nFanning along against light, vagrant airs, the Rattler worked in. Calling the \\nwhale-boat on board, Grief searched out the shore with his binoculars. There was \\nno life. In the hot blaze of tropic sun the place slept. There was no sign of \\nwelcome. Up the beach, on the north shore, where the fringe of cocoanut palms \\nconcealed the village, he could see the black bows of the canoes in the canoe-\\nhouses. On the beach, on even keel, rested the strange schooner. Nothing moved \\non board of her or around her. Not until the beach lay fifty yards away did Grief \\nlet go the anchor in forty fathoms. Out in the middle, long years before, he had \\nsounded three hundred fathoms without reaching bottom, which was to be \\nexpected of a healthy crater-pit like Fuatino. As the chain roared and surged \\nthrough the hawse-pipe he noticed a number of native women, lusciously large as \\nonly those of Polynesia are, in flowing ahu\\'s, flower-crowned, stream out on the \\ndeck of the schooner on the beach. Also, and what they did not see, he saw from \\nthe galley the squat figure of a man steal for\\'ard, drop to the sand, and dive into \\nthe green screen of bush. \\n \\nWhile the sails were furled and gasketed, awnings stretched, and sheets and \\ntackles coiled harbour fashion, David Grief paced the deck and looked vainly for a \\nflutter of life elsewhere than on the strange schooner. Once, beyond any doubt, \\nhe heard the distant crack of a rifle in the direction of the Big Rock. There were \\nno further shots, and he thought of it as some hunter shooting a wild goat. \\n \\nAt the end of another hour Captain Glass, under a mountain of blankets, had \\nceased shivering and was in the inferno of a profound sweat. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll be all right in half an hour,\" he said weakly. \\n \\n\"Very well,\" Grief answered. \"The place is dead, and I\\'m going ashore to see \\nMataara and find out the situation.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n45 \\n\"It\\'s a tough bunch; keep your eyes open,\" the captain warned him. \"If you\\'re not \\nback in an hour, send word off.\" \\n \\nGrief took the steering-sweep, and four of his Raiatea men bent to the oars. As \\nthey landed on the beach he looked curiously at the women under the schooner\\'s \\nawning. He waved his hand tentatively, and they, after giggling, waved back. \\n \\n\"Talofa!\" he called. \\n \\nThey understood the greeting, but replied, \"Iorana,\" and he knew they came from \\nthe Society Group. \\n \\n\"Huahine,\" one of his sailors unhesitatingly named their island. Grief asked them \\nwhence they came, and with giggles and laughter they replied, \"Huahine.\" \\n \\n\"It looks like old Dupuy\\'s schooner,\" Grief said, in Tahitian, speaking in a low \\nvoice. \"Don\\'t look too hard. What do you think, eh? Isn\\'t it the Valetta?\" \\n \\nAs the men climbed out and lifted the whale-boat slightly up the beach they stole \\ncareless glances at the vessel. \\n \\n\"It is the Valetta,\" Taute said. \"She carried her topmast away seven years ago. At \\nPapeete they rigged a new one. It was ten feet shorter. That is the one.\" \\n \\n\"Go over and talk with the women, you boys. You can almost see Huahine from \\nRaiatea, and you\\'ll be sure to know some of them. Find out all you can. And if \\nany of the white men show up, don\\'t start a row.\" \\n \\nAn army of hermit crabs scuttled and rustled away before him as he advanced up \\nthe beach, but under the palms no pigs rooted and grunted. The cocoanuts lay \\nwhere they had fallen, and at the copra-sheds there were no signs of curing. \\nIndustry and tidiness had vanished. Grass house after grass house he found \\ndeserted. Once he came upon an old man, blind, toothless, prodigiously wrinkled, \\nwho sat in the shade and babbled with fear when he spoke to him. It was as if the \\nplace had been struck with the plague, was Grief\\'s thought, as he finally \\napproached the Big House. All was desolation and disarray. There were no flower-\\ncrowned men and maidens, no brown babies rolling in the shade of the avocado \\ntrees. In the doorway, crouched and rocking back and forth, sat Mataara, the old \\nqueen. She wept afresh at sight of him, divided between the tale of her woe and \\nregret that no follower was left to dispense to him her hospitality. \\n \\n\"And so they have taken Naumoo,\" she finished. \"Motauri is dead. My people have \\nfled and are starving with the goats. And there is no one to open for you even a \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n46 \\ndrinking cocoa-nut. O Brother, your white brothers be devils.\" \\n \\n\"They are no brothers of mine, Mataara,\" Grief consoled. \"They are robbers and \\npigs, and I shall clean the island of them----\" \\n \\nHe broke off to whirl half around, his hand flashing to his waist and back again, \\nthe big Colt\\'s levelled at the figure of a man, bent double, that rushed at him from \\nout of the trees. He did not pull the trigger, nor did the man pause till he had \\nflung himself headlong at Grief\\'s feet and begun to pour forth a stream of \\nuncouth and awful noises. He recognized the creature as the one he had seen \\nsteal from the Valetta and dive into the bush; but not until he raised him up and \\nwatched the contortions of the hare-lipped mouth could he understand what he \\nuttered. \\n \\n\"Save me, master, save me!\" the man yammered, in English, though he was \\nunmistakably a South Sea native. \"I know you! Save me!\" \\n \\nAnd thereat he broke into a wild outpour of incoherence that did not cease until \\nGrief seized him by the shoulders and shook him into silence. \\n \\n\"I know you,\" Grief said. \"You were cook in the French Hotel at Papeete two years \\nago. Everybody called you \\'Hare-Lip.\\'\" \\n \\nThe man nodded violently. \\n \\n\"I am now cook of the Valetta,\" he spat and spluttered, his mouth writhing in a \\nfearful struggle with its defect. \"I know you. I saw you at the hotel. I saw you at \\nLavina\\'s. I saw you on the Kittiwake. I saw you at the Mariposa wharf. You are \\nCaptain Grief, and you will save me. Those men are devils. They killed Captain \\nDupuy. Me they made kill half the crew. Two they shot from the cross-trees. The \\nrest they shot in the water. I knew them all. They stole the girls from Huahine. \\nThey added to their strength with jail-men from Noumea. They robbed the traders \\nin the New Hebrides. They killed the trader at Vanikori, and stole two women \\nthere. They----\" \\n \\nBut Grief no longer heard. Through the trees, from the direction of the harbour, \\ncame a rattle of rifles, and he started on the run for the beach. Pirates from Tahiti \\nand convicts from New Caledonia! A pretty bunch of desperadoes that even now \\nwas attacking his schooner. Hare-Lip followed, still spluttering and spitting his \\ntale of the white devils\\' doings. \\n \\nThe rifle-firing ceased as abruptly as it had begun, but Grief ran on, perplexed by \\nominous conjectures, until, in a turn of the path, he encountered Mauriri \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n47 \\nrunning toward him from the beach. \\n \\n\"Big Brother,\" the Goat Man panted, \"I was too late. They have taken your \\nschooner. Come! For now they will seek for you.\" \\n \\nHe started back up the path away from the beach. \\n \\n\"Where is Brown?\" Grief demanded. \\n \\n\"On the Big Rock. I will tell you afterward. Come now!\" \\n \\n\"But my men in the whaleboat?\" \\n \\nMauriri was in an agony of apprehension. \\n \\n\"They are with the women on the strange schooner. They will not be killed. I tell \\nyou true. The devils want sailors. But you they will kill. Listen!\" From the water, \\nin a cracked tenor voice, came a French hunting song. \"They are landing on the \\nbeach. They have taken your schooner--that I saw. Come!\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nCareless of his own life and skin, nevertheless David Grief was possessed of no \\nfalse hardihood. He knew when to fight and when to run, and that this was the \\ntime for running he had no doubt. Up the path, past the old men sitting in the \\nshade, past Mataara crouched in the doorway of the Big House, he followed at the \\nheels of Mauriri. At his own heels, doglike, plodded Hare-Lip. From behind came \\nthe cries of the hunters, but the pace Mauriri led them was heartbreaking. The \\nbroad path narrowed, swung to the right, and pitched upward. The last grass \\nhouse was left, and through high thickets of cassi and swarms of great golden \\nwasps the way rose steeply until it became a goat-track. Pointing upward to a \\nbare shoulder of volcanic rock, Mauriri indicated the trail across its face. \\n \\n\"Past that we are safe, Big Brother,\" he said. \"The white devils never dare it, for \\nthere are rocks we roll down on their heads, and there is no other path. Always \\ndo they stop here and shoot when we cross the rock. Come!\" \\n \\nA quarter of an hour later they paused where the trail went naked on the face of \\nthe rock. \\n \\n\"Wait, and when you come, come quickly,\" Mauriri cautioned. \\n \\nHe sprang into the blaze of sunlight, and from below several rifles pumped \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n48 \\nrapidly. Bullets smacked about him, and puffs of stone-dust flew out, but he won \\nsafely across. Grief followed, and so near did one bullet come that the dust of its \\nimpact stung his cheek. Nor was Hare-Lip struck, though he essayed the passage \\nmore slowly. \\n \\nFor the rest of the day, on the greater heights, they lay in a lava glen where \\nterraced taro and papaia grew. And here Grief made his plans and learned the \\nfulness of the situation. \\n \\n\"It was ill luck,\" Mauriri said. \"Of all nights this one night was selected by the \\nwhite devils to go fishing. It was dark as we came through the passage. They were \\nin boats and canoes. Always do they have their rifles with them. One Raiatea man \\nthey shot. Brown was very brave. We tried to get by to the top of the bay, but they \\nheaded us off, and we were driven in between the Big Rock and the village. We \\nsaved the guns and all the ammunition, but they got the boat. Thus they learned \\nof your coming. Brown is now on this side of the Big Rock with the guns and the \\nammunition.\" \\n \\n\"But why didn\\'t he go over the top of the Big Rock and give me warning as I came \\nin from the sea?\" Grief criticised. \\n \\n\"They knew not the way. Only the goats and I know the way. And this I forgot, for \\nI crept through the bush to gain the water and swim to you. But the devils were \\nin the bush shooting at Brown and the Raiatea men; and me they hunted till \\ndaylight, and through the morning they hunted me there in the low-lying land. \\nThen you came in your schooner, and they watched till you went ashore, and I \\ngot away through the bush, but you were already ashore.\" \\n \\n\"You fired that shot?\" \\n \\n\"Yes; to warn you. But they were wise and would not shoot back, and it was my \\nlast cartridge.\" \\n \\n\"Now you, Hare-Lip?\" Grief said to the Valetta\\'s cook. \\n \\nHis tale was long and painfully detailed. For a year he had been sailing out of \\nTahiti and through the Paumotus on the Valetta. Old Dupuy was owner and \\ncaptain. On his last cruise he had shipped two strangers in Tahiti as mate and \\nsupercargo. Also, another stranger he carried to be his agent on Fanriki. Raoul \\nVan Asveld and Carl Lepsius were the names of the mate and supercargo. \\n \\n\"They are brothers, I know, for I have heard them talk in the dark, on deck, when \\nthey thought no one listened,\" Hare-Lip explained. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n49 \\n \\nThe Valetta cruised through the Low Islands, picking up shell and pearls at \\nDupuy\\'s stations. Frans Amundson, the third stranger, relieved Pierre Gollard at \\nFanriki. Pierre Gollard came on board to go back to Tahiti. The natives of Fanriki \\nsaid he had a quart of pearls to turn over to Dupuy. The first night out from \\nFanriki there was shooting in the cabin. Then the bodies of Dupuy and Pierre \\nGollard were thrown overboard. The Tahitian sailors fled to the forecastle. For two \\ndays, with nothing to eat and the Valetta hove to, they remained below. Then \\nRaoul Van Asveld put poison in the meal he made Hare-Lip cook and carry \\nfor\\'ard. Half the sailors died. \\n \\n\"He had a rifle pointed at me, master; what could I do?\" Hare-Lip whimpered. \"Of \\nthe rest, two went up the rigging and were shot. Fanriki was ten miles away. The \\nothers went overboard to swim. They were shot as they swam. I, only, lived, and \\nthe two devils; for me they wanted to cook for them. That day, with the breeze, \\nthey went back to Fanrika and took on Frans Amundson, for he was one of \\nthem.\" \\n \\nThen followed Hare-Lip\\'s nightmare experiences as the schooner wandered on the \\nlong reaches to the westward. He was the one living witness and knew they would \\nhave killed him had he not been the cook. At Noumea five convicts had joined \\nthem. Hare-Lip was never permitted ashore at any of the islands, and Grief was \\nthe first outsider to whom he had spoken. \\n \\n\"And now they will kill me,\" Hare-Lip spluttered, \"for they will know I have told \\nyou. Yet am I not all a coward, and I will stay with you, master, and die with you.\" \\n \\nThe Goat Man shook his head and stood up. \\n \\n\"Lie here and rest,\" he said to Grief. \"It will be a long swim to-night. As for this \\ncook-man, I will take him now to the higher places where my brothers live with \\nthe goats.\" \\n \\nIV \\n \\n\"It is well that you swim as a man should, Big Brother,\" Mauriri whispered. \\n \\nFrom the lava glen they had descended to the head of the bay and taken to the \\nwater. They swam softly, without splash, Mauriri in the lead. The black walls of \\nthe crater rose about them till it seemed they swam on the bottom of a great bowl. \\nAbove was the sky of faintly luminous star-dust. Ahead they could see the light \\nwhich marked the Rattler, and from her deck, softened by distance, came a \\ngospel hymn played on the phonograph intended for Pilsach. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n50 \\n \\nThe two swimmers bore to the left, away from the captured schooner. Laughter \\nand song followed on board after the hymn, then the phonograph started again. \\nGrief grinned to himself at the appositeness of it as \"Lead, Kindly Light,\" floated \\nout over the dark water. \\n \\n\"We must take the passage and land on the Big Rock,\" Mauriri whispered. \"The \\ndevils are holding the low land. Listen!\" \\n \\nHalf a dozen rifle shots, at irregular intervals, attested that Brown still held the \\nRock and that the pirates had invested the narrow peninsula. \\n \\nAt the end of another hour they swam under the frowning loom of the Big Rock. \\nMauriri, feeling his way, led the landing in a crevice, up which for a hundred feet \\nthey climbed to a narrow ledge. \\n \\n\"Stay here,\" said Mauriri. \"I go to Brown. In the morning I shall return.\" \\n \\n\"I will go with you, Brother,\" Grief said. \\n \\nMauriri laughed in the darkness. \\n \\n\"Even you, Big Brother, cannot do this thing. I am the Goat Man, and I only, of all \\nFuatino, can go over the Big Rock in the night. Furthermore, it will be the first \\ntime that even I have done it. Put out your hand. You feel it? That is where \\nPilsach\\'s dynamite is kept. Lie close beside the wall and you may sleep without \\nfalling. I go now.\" \\n \\nAnd high above the sounding surf, on a narrow shelf beside a ton of dynamite, \\nDavid Grief planned his campaign, then rested his cheek on his arm and slept. \\n \\nIn the morning, when Mauriri led him over the summit of the Big Rock, David \\nGrief understood why he could not have done it in the night. Despite the \\naccustomed nerve of a sailor for height and precarious clinging, he marvelled that \\nhe was able to do it in the broad light of day. There were places, always under \\nminute direction of Mauriri, that he leaned forward, falling, across hundred-foot-\\ndeep crevices, until his outstretched hands struck a grip on the opposing wall \\nand his legs could then be drawn across after. Once, there was a ten-foot leap, \\nabove half a thousand feet of yawning emptiness and down a fathom\\'s length to a \\nmeagre foothold. And he, despite his cool head, lost it another time on a shelf, a \\nscant twelve inches wide, where all hand-holds seemed to fail him. And Mauriri, \\nseeing him sway, swung his own body far out and over the gulf and passed him, \\nat the same time striking him sharply on the back to brace his reeling brain. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n51 \\nThen it was, and forever after, that he fully knew why Mauriri had been named \\nthe Goat Man. \\n \\nV \\n \\nThe defence of the Big Rock had its good points and its defects. Impregnable to \\nassault, two men could hold it against ten thousand. Also, it guarded the passage \\nto open sea. The two schooners, Raoul Van Asveld, and his cutthroat following \\nwere bottled up. Grief, with the ton of dynamite, which he had removed higher up \\nthe rock, was master. This he demonstrated, one morning, when the schooners \\nattempted to put to sea. The Valetta led, the whaleboat towing her manned by \\ncaptured Fuatino men. Grief and the Goat Man peered straight down from a safe \\nrock-shelter, three hundred feet above. Their rifles were beside them, also a \\nglowing fire-stick and a big bundle of dynamite sticks with fuses and decanators \\nattached. As the whaleboat came beneath, Mauriri shook his head. \\n \\n\"They are our brothers. We cannot shoot.\" \\n \\nFor\\'ard, on the Valetta, were several of Grief\\'s own Raiatea sailors. Aft stood \\nanother at the wheel. The pirates were below, or on the other schooner, with the \\nexception of one who stood, rifle in hand, amidships. For protection he held \\nNaumoo, the Queen\\'s daughter, close to him. \\n \\n\"That is the chief devil,\" Mauriri whispered, \"and his eyes are blue like yours. He \\nis a terrible man. See! He holds Naumoo that we may not shoot him.\" \\n \\nA light air and a slight tide were making into the passage, and the schooner\\'s \\nprogress was slow. \\n \\n\"Do you speak English?\" Grief called down. \\n \\nThe man startled, half lifted his rifle to the perpendicular, and looked up. There \\nwas something quick and catlike in his movements, and in his burned blond face \\na fighting eagerness. It was the face of a killer. \\n \\n\"Yes,\" he answered. \"What do you want?\" \\n \\n\"Turn back, or I\\'ll blow your schooner up,\" Grief warned. He blew on the fire-stick \\nand whispered, \"Tell Naumoo to break away from him and run aft.\" \\n \\nFrom the Rattler, close astern, rifles cracked, and bullets spatted against the \\nrock. Van Asveld laughed defiantly, and Mauriri called down in the native tongue \\nto the woman. When directly beneath, Grief, watching, saw her jerk away from \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n52 \\nthe man. On the instant Grief touched the fire-stick to the match-head in the \\nsplit end of the short fuse, sprang into view on the face of the rock, and dropped \\nthe dynamite. Van Asveld had managed to catch the girl and was struggling with \\nher. The Goat Man held a rifle on him and waited a chance. The dynamite struck \\nthe deck in a compact package, bounded, and rolled into the port scupper. Van \\nAsveld saw it and hesitated, then he and the girl ran aft for their lives. The Goat \\nMan fired, but splintered the corner of the galley. The spattering of bullets from \\nthe Rattler increased, and the two on the rock crouched low for shelter and \\nwaited. Mauriri tried to see what was happening below, but Grief held him back. \\n \\n\"The fuse was too long,\" he said. \"I\\'ll know better next time.\" \\n \\nIt was half a minute before the explosion came. What happened afterward, for \\nsome little time, they could not tell, for the Rattler\\'s marksmen had got the range \\nand were maintaining a steady fire. Once, fanned by a couple of bullets, Grief \\nrisked a peep. The Valetta, her port deck and rail torn away, was listing and \\nsinking as she drifted back into the harbour. Climbing on board the Rattler were \\nthe men and the Huahine women who had been hidden in the Valetta\\'s cabin and \\nwho had swum for it under the protecting fire. The Fuatino men who had been \\ntowing in the whaleboat had cast off the line, dashed back through the passage, \\nand were rowing wildly for the south shore. \\n \\nFrom the shore of the peninsula the discharges of four rifles announced that \\nBrown and his men had worked through the jungle to the beach and were taking \\na hand. The bullets ceased coming, and Grief and Mauriri joined in with their \\nrifles. But they could do no damage, for the men of the Rattler were firing from \\nthe shelter of the deck-houses, while the wind and tide carried the schooner \\nfarther in. \\n \\nThere was no sign of the Valetta, which had sunk in the deep water of the crater. \\n \\nTwo things Raoul Van Asveld did that showed his keenness and coolness and \\nthat elicited Grief\\'s admiration. Under the Rattler\\'s rifle fire Raoul compelled the \\nfleeing Fuatino men to come in and surrender. And at the same time, dispatching \\nhalf his cutthroats in the Rattler\\'s boat, he threw them ashore and across the \\npeninsula, preventing Brown from getting away to the main part of the island. \\nAnd for the rest of the morning the intermittent shooting told to Grief how Brown \\nwas being driven in to the other side of the Big Rock. The situation was \\nunchanged, with the exception of the loss of the Valetta. \\n \\nVI \\n \\nThe defects of the position on the Big Rock were vital. There was neither food nor \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n53 \\nwater. For several nights, accompanied by one of the \\n \\nRaiatea men, Mauriri swam to the head of the bay for supplies. Then came the \\nnight when lights flared on the water and shots were fired. After that the water-\\nside of the Big Rock was invested as well. \\n \\n\"It\\'s a funny situation,\" Brown remarked, who was getting all the adventure he \\nhad been led to believe resided in the South Seas. \"We\\'ve got hold and can\\'t let go, \\nand Raoul has hold and can\\'t let go. He can\\'t get away, and we\\'re liable to starve \\nto death holding him.\" \\n \\n\"If the rain came, the rock-basins would fill,\" said Mauriri. It was their first \\ntwenty-four hours without water. \"Big Brother, to-night you and I will get water. \\nIt is the work of strong men.\" \\n \\nThat night, with cocoanut calabashes, each of quart capacity and tightly \\nstoppered, he led Grief down to the water from the peninsula side of the Big Rock. \\nThey swam out not more than a hundred feet. Beyond, they could hear the \\noccasional click of an oar or the knock of a paddle against a canoe, and \\nsometimes they saw the flare of matches as the men in the guarding boats lighted \\ncigarettes or pipes. \\n \\n\"Wait here,\" whispered Mauriri, \"and hold the calabashes.\" \\n \\nTurning over, he swam down. Grief, face downward, watched his phosphorescent \\ntrack glimmer, and dim, and vanish. A long minute afterward Mauriri broke \\nsurface noiselessly at Grief\\'s side. \\n \\n\"Here! Drink!\" \\n \\nThe calabash was full, and Grief drank sweet fresh water which had come up \\nfrom the depths of the salt. \\n \\n\"It flows out from the land,\" said Mauriri. \\n \\n\"On the bottom?\" \\n \\n\"No. The bottom is as far below as the mountains are above. Fifty feet down it \\nflows. Swim down until you feel its coolness.\" \\n \\nSeveral times filling and emptying his lungs in diver fashion, Grief turned over \\nand went down through the water. Salt it was to his lips, and warm to his flesh; \\nbut at last, deep down, it perceptibly chilled and tasted brackish. Then, suddenly, \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n54 \\nhis body entered the cold, subterranean stream. He removed the small stopper \\nfrom the calabash, and, as the sweet water gurgled into it, he saw the \\nphosphorescent glimmer of a big fish, like a sea ghost, drift sluggishly by. \\n \\nThereafter, holding the growing weight of the calabashes, he remained on the \\nsurface, while Mauriri took them down, one by one, and filled them. \\n \\n\"There are sharks,\" Grief said, as they swam back to shore. \\n \\n\"Pooh!\" was the answer. \"They are fish sharks. We of Fuatino are brothers to the \\nfish sharks.\" \\n \\n\"But the tiger sharks? I have seen them here.\" \\n \\n\"When they come, Big Brother, we will have no more water to drink--unless it \\nrains.\" \\n \\nVII \\n \\nA week later Mauriri and a Raiatea man swam back with empty calabashes. The \\ntiger sharks had arrived in the harbour. The next day they thirsted on the Big \\nRock. \\n \\n\"We must take our chance,\" said Grief. \"Tonight I shall go after water with \\nMautau. Tomorrow night, Brother, you will go with Tehaa.\" \\n \\nThree quarts only did Grief get, when the tiger sharks appeared and drove them \\nin. There were six of them on the Rock, and a pint a day, in the sweltering heat of \\nthe mid-tropics, is not sufficient moisture for a man\\'s body. The next night \\nMauriri and Tehaa returned with no water. And the day following Brown learned \\nthe full connotation of thirst, when the lips crack to bleeding, the mouth is coated \\nwith granular slime, and the swollen tongue finds the mouth too small for \\nresidence. \\n \\nGrief swam out in the darkness with Mautau. Turn by turn, they went down \\nthrough the salt, to the cool sweet stream, drinking their fill while the calabashes \\nwere filling. It was Mau-tau\\'s turn to descend with the last calabash, and Grief, \\npeering down from the surface, saw the glimmer of sea-ghosts and all the \\nphosphorescent display of the struggle. He swam back alone, but without \\nrelinquishing the precious burden of full calabashes. \\n \\nOf food they had little. Nothing grew on the Rock, and its sides, covered with \\nshellfish at sea level where the surf thundered in, were too precipitous for access. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n55 \\nHere and there, where crevices permitted, a few rank shellfish and sea urchins \\nwere gleaned. Sometimes frigate birds and other sea birds were snared. Once, \\nwith a piece of frigate bird, they succeeded in hooking a shark. After that, with \\njealously guarded shark-meat for bait, they managed on occasion to catch more \\nsharks. \\n \\nBut water remained their direst need. Mauriri prayed to the Goat God for rain. \\nTaute prayed to the Missionary God, and his two fellow islanders, backsliding, \\ninvoked the deities of their old heathen days. Grief grinned and considered. But \\nBrown, wild-eyed, with protruding blackened tongue, cursed. Especially he \\ncursed the phonograph that in the cool twilights ground out gospel hymns from \\nthe deck of the Rattler. One hymn in particular, \"Beyond the Smiling and the \\nWeeping,\" drove him to madness. It seemed a favourite on board the schooner, for \\nit was played most of all. Brown, hungry and thirsty, half out of his head from \\nweakness and suffering, could lie among the rocks with equanimity and listen to \\nthe tinkling of ukuleles and guitars, and the hulas and himines of the Huahine \\nwomen. But when the voices of the Trinity Choir floated over the water he was \\nbeside himself. One evening the cracked tenor took up the song with the \\nmachine: \\n \\n     \"Beyond the smiling and the weeping,         I shall be soon.      Beyond the \\nwaking and the sleeping,      Beyond the sowing and the reaping,         I shall be \\nsoon,         I shall be soon.\" \\n \\nThen it was that Brown rose up. Again and again, blindly, he emptied his rifle at \\nthe schooner. Laughter floated up from the men and women, and from the \\npeninsula came a splattering of return bullets; but the cracked tenor sang on, \\nand Brown continued to fire, until the hymn was played out. \\n \\nIt was that night that Grief and Mauriri came back with but one calabash of \\nwater. A patch of skin six inches long was missing from Grief\\'s shoulder in token \\nof the scrape of the sandpaper hide of a shark whose dash he had eluded. \\n \\nVIII \\n \\nIn the early morning of another day, before the sun-blaze had gained its full \\nstrength, came an offer of a parley from Raoul Van Asveld. \\n \\nBrown brought the word in from the outpost among the rocks a hundred yards \\naway. Grief was squatted over a small fire, broiling a strip of shark-flesh. The last \\ntwenty-four hours had been lucky. Seaweed and sea urchins had been gathered. \\nTehaa had caught a shark, and Mauriri had captured a fair-sized octopus at the \\nbase of the crevice where the dynamite was stored. Then, too, in the darkness \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n56 \\nthey had made two successful swims for water before the tiger sharks had nosed \\nthem out. \\n \\n\"Said he\\'d like to come in and talk with you,\" Brown said. \"But I know what the \\nbrute is after. Wants to see how near starved to death we are.\" \\n \\n\"Bring him in,\" Grief said. \\n \\n\"And then we will kill him,\" the Goat Man cried joyously. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"But he is a killer of men, Big Brother, a beast and a devil,\" the Goat Man \\nprotested. \\n \\n\"He must not be killed, Brother. It is our way not to break our word.\" \\n \\n\"It is a foolish way.\" \\n \\n\"Still it is our way,\" Grief answered gravely, turning the strip of shark-meat over \\non the coals and noting the hungry sniff and look of Tehaa. \"Don\\'t do that, Tehaa, \\nwhen the Big Devil comes. Look as if you and hunger were strangers. Here, cook \\nthose sea urchins, you, and you, Big Brother, cook the squid. We will have the \\nBig Devil to feast with us. Spare nothing. Cook all.\" \\n \\nAnd, still broiling meat, Grief arose as Raoul Van Asveld, followed by a large Irish \\nterrier, strode into camp. Raoul did not make the mistake of holding out his \\nhand. \\n \\n\"Hello!\" he said. \"I\\'ve heard of you.\" \\n \\n\"I wish I\\'d never heard of you,\" Grief answered. \\n \\n\"Same here,\" was the response. \"At first, before I knew who it was, I thought I had \\nto deal with an ordinary trading captain. That\\'s why you\\'ve got me bottled up.\" \\n \\n\"And I am ashamed to say that I underrated you,\" Grief smiled. \"I took you for a \\nthieving beachcomber, and not for a really intelligent pirate and murderer. Hence, \\nthe loss of my schooner. Honours are even, I fancy, on that score.\" \\n \\nRaoul flushed angrily under his sunburn, but he contained himself. His eyes \\nroved over the supply of food and the full water-calabashes, though he concealed \\nthe incredulous surprise he felt. His was a tall, slender, well-knit figure, and \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n57 \\nGrief, studying him, estimated his character from his face. The eyes were keen \\nand strong, but a bit too close together--not pinched, however, but just a trifle \\nnear to balance the broad forehead, the strong chin and jaw, and the cheekbones \\nwide apart. Strength! His face was filled with it, and yet Grief sensed in it the \\nintangible something the man lacked. \\n \\n\"We are both strong men,\" Raoul said, with a bow. \"We might have been fighting \\nfor empires a hundred years ago.\" \\n \\nIt was Grief\\'s turn to bow. \\n \\n\"As it is, we are squalidly scrapping over the enforcement of the colonial laws of \\nthose empires whose destinies we might possibly have determined a hundred \\nyears ago.\" \\n \\n\"It all comes to dust,\" Raoul remarked sen-tentiously, sitting down. \"Go ahead \\nwith your meal. Don\\'t let me interrupt.\" \\n \\n\"Won\\'t you join us?\" was Grief\\'s invitation. \\n \\nThe other looked at him with sharp steadiness, then accepted. \\n \\n\"I\\'m sticky with sweat,\" he said. \"Can I wash?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded and ordered Mauriri to bring a calabash. Raoul looked into the Goat \\nMan\\'s eyes, but saw nothing save languid uninterest as the precious quart of \\nwater was wasted on the ground. \\n \\n\"The dog is thirsty,\" Raoul said. \\n \\nGrief nodded, and another calabash was presented to the animal. \\n \\nAgain Raoul searched the eyes of the natives and learned nothing. \\n \\n\"Sorry we have no coffee,\" Grief apologized. \"You\\'ll have to drink plain water. A \\ncalabash, Tehaa. Try some of this shark. There is squid to follow, and sea urchins \\nand a seaweed salad. I\\'m sorry we haven\\'t any frigate bird. The boys were lazy \\nyesterday, and did not try to catch any.\" \\n \\nWith an appetite that would not have stopped at wire nails dipped in lard, Grief \\nate perfunctorily, and tossed the scraps to the dog. \\n \\n\"I\\'m afraid I haven\\'t got down to the primitive diet yet,\" he sighed, as he sat back. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n58 \\n\"The tinned goods on the Rattler, now I could make a hearty meal off of them, but \\nthis muck----\" He took a half-pound strip of broiled shark and flung it to the dog. \\n\"I suppose I\\'ll come to it if you don\\'t surrender pretty soon.\" \\n \\nRaoul laughed unpleasantly. \\n \\n\"I came to offer terms,\" he said pointedly. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"There aren\\'t any terms. I\\'ve got you where the hair is short, and I\\'m not going to \\nlet go.\" \\n \\n\"You think you can hold me in this hole!\" Raoul cried. \\n \\n\"You\\'ll never leave it alive, except in double irons.\" Grief surveyed his guest with \\nan air of consideration. \"I\\'ve handled your kind before. We\\'ve pretty well cleaned it \\nout of the South Seas. But you are a--how shall I say?--a sort of an anachronism. \\nYou\\'re a throwback, and we\\'ve got to get rid of you. Personally, I would advise you \\nto go back to the schooner and blow your brains out. It is the only way to escape \\nwhat you\\'ve got coming to you.\" \\n \\nThe parley, so far as Raoul was concerned, proved fruitless, and he went back \\ninto his own lines convinced that the men on the Big Rock could hold out for \\nyears, though he would have been swiftly unconvinced could he have observed \\nTehaa and the Raiateans, the moment his back was turned and he was out of \\nsight, crawling over the rocks and sucking and crunching the scraps his dog had \\nleft uneaten. \\n \\nIX \\n \\n\"We hunger now, Brother,\" Grief said, \"but it is better than to hunger for many \\ndays to come. The Big Devil, after feasting and drinking good water with us in \\nplenty, will not stay long in Fuatino. Even to-morrow may he try to leave. To-night \\nyou and I sleep over the top of the Rock, and Tehaa, who shoots well, will sleep \\nwith us if he can dare the Rock.\" \\n \\nTehaa, alone among the Raiateans, was cragsman enough to venture the perilous \\nway, and dawn found him in a rock-barricaded nook, a hundred yards to the \\nright of Grief and Mauriri. \\n \\nThe first warning was the firing of rifles from the peninsula, where Brown and his \\ntwo Raiateans signalled the retreat and followed the besiegers through the jungle \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n59 \\nto the beach. From the eyrie on the face of the rock Grief could see nothing for \\nanother hour, when the Rattler appeared, making for the passage. As before, the \\ncaptive Fuatino men towed in the whaleboat. Mauriri, under direction of Grief, \\ncalled down instructions to them as they passed slowly beneath. By Grief\\'s side \\nlay several bundles of dynamite sticks, well-lashed together and with extremely \\nshort fuses. \\n \\nThe deck of the Rattler was populous. For\\'ard, rifle in hand, among the Raiatean \\nsailors, stood a desperado whom Mauriri announced was Raoul\\'s brother. Aft, by \\nthe helmsman, stood another. Attached to him, tied waist to waist, with slack, \\nwas Mataara, the old Queen. On the other side of the helmsman, his arm in a \\nsling, was Captain Glass. Amidships, as before, was Raoul, and with him, lashed \\nwaist to waist, was Naumoo. \\n \\n\"Good morning, Mister David Grief,\" Raoul called up. \\n \\n\"And yet I warned you that only in double irons would you leave the island,\" Grief \\nmurmured down with a sad inflection. \\n \\n\"You can\\'t kill all your people I have on board,\" was the answer. \\n \\nThe schooner, moving slowly, jerk by jerk, as the men pulled in the whaleboat, \\nwas almost directly beneath. The rowers, without ceasing, slacked on their oars, \\nand were immediately threatened with the rifle of the man who stood for\\'ard. \\n \\n\"Throw, Big Brother!\" Naumoo called up in the Fuatino tongue. \"I am filled with \\nsorrow and am willed to die. His knife is ready with which to cut the rope, but I \\nshall hold him tight. Be not afraid, Big Brother. Throw, and throw straight, and \\ngood-bye.\" \\n \\nGrief hesitated, then lowered the fire-stick which he had been blowing bright. \\n \\n\"Throw!\" the Goat Man urged. \\n \\nStill Grief hesitated. \\n \\n\"If they get to sea, Big Brother, Naumoo dies just the same. And there are all the \\nothers. What is her life against the many?\" \\n \\n\"If you drop any dynamite, or fire a single shot, we\\'ll kill all on board,\" Raoul cried \\nup to them. \"I\\'ve got you, David Grief. You can\\'t kill these people, and I can. Shut \\nup, you!\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n60 \\nThis last was addressed to Naumoo, who was calling up in her native tongue and \\nwhom Raoul seized by the neck with one hand to choke to silence. In turn, she \\nlocked both arms about him and looked up beseechingly to Grief. \\n \\n\"Throw it, Mr. Grief, and be damned to them,\" Captain Glass rumbled in his deep \\nvoice. \"They\\'re bloody murderers, and the cabin\\'s full of them.\" \\n \\nThe desperado who was fastened to the old Queen swung half about to menace \\nCaptain Glass with his rifle, when Tehaa, from his position farther along the \\nRock, pulled trigger on him. The rifle dropped from the man\\'s hand, and on his \\nface was an expression of intense surprise as his legs crumpled under him and \\nhe sank down on deck, dragging the Queen with him. \\n \\n\"Port! Hard a port!\" Grief cried. \\n \\nCaptain Glass and the Kanaka whirled the wheel over, and the bow of the Rattler \\nheaded in for the Rock. Amidships Raoul still struggled with Naumoo. His brother \\nran from for\\'ard to his aid, being missed by the fusillade of quick shots from \\nTehaa and the Goat Man. As Raoul\\'s brother placed the muzzle of his rifle to \\nNaumoo\\'s side Grief touched the fire-stick to the match-head in the split end of \\nthe fuse. Even as with both hands he tossed the big bundle of dynamite, the rifle \\nwent off, and Naumoo\\'s fall to the deck was simultaneous with the fall of the \\ndynamite. This time the fuse was short enough. The explosion occurred at the \\ninstant the deck was reached, and that portion of the Rattler, along with Raoul, \\nhis brother, and Naumoo, forever disappeared. \\n \\nThe schooner\\'s side was shattered, and she began immediately to settle. For\\'ard, \\nevery Raiatean sailor dived overboard. Captain Glass met the first man springing \\nup the com-panionway from the cabin, with a kick full in the face, but was \\noverborne and trampled on by the rush. Following the desperadoes came the \\nHuahine women, and as they went overboard, the Rattler sank on an even keel \\nclose to the base of the Rock. Her cross-trees still stuck out when she reached \\nbottom. \\n \\nLooking down, Grief could see all that occurred beneath the surface. He saw \\nMataara, a fathom deep, unfasten herself from the dead pirate and swim upward. \\nAs her head emerged she saw Captain Glass, who could not swim, sinking several \\nyards away. The Queen, old woman that she was, but an islander, turned over, \\nswam down to him, and held him up as she struck out for the unsubmerged \\ncross-trees. \\n \\nFive heads, blond and brown, were mingled with the dark heads of Polynesia that \\ndotted the surface. Grief, rifle in hand, watched for a chance to shoot. The Goat \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n61 \\nMan, after a minute, was successful, and they saw the body of one man sink \\nsluggishly. But to the Raiatean sailors, big and brawny, half fish, was the \\nvengeance given. Swimming swiftly, they singled out the blond heads and the \\nbrown. Those from above watched the four surviving desperadoes, clutched and \\nlocked, dragged far down beneath and drowned like curs. \\n \\nIn ten minutes everything was over. The Huahine women, laughing and giggling, \\nwere holding on to the sides of the whaleboat which had done the towing. The \\nRaiatean sailors, waiting for orders, were about the cross-tree to which Captain \\nGlass and Mataara clung. \\n \\n\"The poor old Rattler,\" Captain Glass lamented. \\n \\n\"Nothing of the sort,\" Grief answered. \"In a week we\\'ll have her raised, new \\ntimbers amidships, and we\\'ll be on our way.\" And to the Queen, \"How is it with \\nyou, Sister?\" \\n \\n\"Naumoo is gone, and Motauri, Brother, but Fuatino is ours again. The day is \\nyoung. Word shall be sent to all my people in the high places with the goats. And \\nto-night, once again, and as never before, we shall feast and rejoice in the Big \\nHouse.\" \\n \\n\"She\\'s been needing new timbers abaft the beam there for years,\" quoth Captain \\nGlass. \"But the chronometers will be out of commission for the rest of the cruise.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n62 \\n \\nChapter Four--THE JOKERS OF NEW GIBBON \\n \\n I \\n \\n\"I\\'m almost afraid to take you in to New Gibbon,\" David Grief said. \"It wasn\\'t until \\nyou and the British gave me a free hand and let the place alone that any results \\nwere accomplished.\" \\n \\nWallenstein, the German Resident Commissioner from Bougainville, poured \\nhimself a long Scotch and soda and smiled. \\n \\n\"We take off our hats to you, Mr. Grief,\" he said in perfectly good English. \"What \\nyou have done on the devil island is a miracle. And we shall continue not to \\ninterfere. It is a devil island, and old Koho is the big chief devil of them all. We \\nnever could bring him to terms. He is a liar, and he is no fool. He is a black \\nNapoleon, a head-hunting, man-eating Talleyrand. I remember six years ago, \\nwhen I landed there in the British cruiser. The niggers cleared out for the bush, \\nof course, but we found several who couldn\\'t get away. One was his latest wife. \\nShe had been hung up by one arm in the sun for two days and nights. We cut her \\ndown, but she died just the same. And staked out in the fresh running water, up \\nto their necks, were three more women. All their bones were broken and their \\njoints crushed. The process is supposed to make them tender for the eating. They \\nwere still alive. Their vitality was remarkable. One woman, the oldest, lingered \\nnearly ten days. Well, that was a sample of Koho\\'s diet. No wonder he\\'s a wild \\nbeast. How you ever pacified him is our everlasting puzzlement.\" \\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t call him exactly pacified,\" Grief answered. \"Though he comes in once \\nin a while and eats out of the hand.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s more than we accomplished with our cruisers. Neither the German nor \\nthe English ever laid eyes on him. You were the first.\" \\n \\n\"No; McTavish was the first,\" Grief disclaimed. \\n \\n\"Ah, yes, I remember him--the little, dried-up Scotchman.\" Wallenstein sipped his \\nwhiskey. \"He\\'s called the Trouble-mender, isn\\'t he?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"And they say the screw you pay him is bigger than mine or the British \\nResident\\'s?\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n63 \\n \\n\"I\\'m afraid it is,\" Grief admitted. \"You see, and no offence, he\\'s really worth it. He \\nspends his time wherever the trouble is. He is a wizard. He\\'s the one who got me \\nmy lodgment on New Gibbon. He\\'s down on Malaita now, starting a plantation for \\nme.\" \\n \\n\"The first?\" \\n \\n\"There\\'s not even a trading station on all Malaita. The recruiters still use covering \\nboats and carry the old barbed wire above their rails. There\\'s the plantation now. \\nWe\\'ll be in in half an hour.\" He handed the binoculars to his guest. \"Those are the \\nboat-sheds to the left of the bungalow. Beyond are the barracks. And to the right \\nare the copra-sheds. We dry quite a bit already. Old Koho\\'s getting civilized \\nenough to make his people bring in the nuts. There\\'s the mouth of the stream \\nwhere you found the three women softening.\" \\n \\nThe Wonder, wing-and-wing, was headed directly in for the anchorage. She rose \\nand fell lazily over a glassy swell flawed here and there by catspaws from astern. \\nIt was the tail-end of the monsoon season, and the air was heavy and sticky with \\ntropic moisture, the sky a florid, leaden muss of formless clouds. The rugged land \\nwas swathed with cloud-banks and squall wreaths, through which headlands and \\ninterior peaks thrust darkly. On one promontory a slant of sunshine blazed \\ntorridly, on another, scarcely a mile away, a squall was bursting in furious \\ndownpour of driving rain. \\n \\nThis was the dank, fat, savage island of New Gibbon, lying fifty miles to leeward of \\nChoiseul. Geographically, it belonged to the Solomon Group. Politically, the \\ndividing line of German and British influence cut it in half, hence the joint control \\nby the two Resident Commissioners. In the case of New Gibbon, this control \\nexisted only on paper in the colonial offices of the two countries. There was no \\nreal control at all, and never had been. The bêche de mer fishermen of the old \\ndays had passed it by. The sandalwood traders, after stern experiences, had given \\nit up. The blackbirders had never succeeded in recruiting one labourer on the \\nisland, and, after the schooner Dorset had been cut off with all hands, they left \\nthe place severely alone. Later, a German company had attempted a cocoanut \\nplantation, which was abandoned after several managers and a number of \\ncontract labourers had lost their heads. German cruisers and British cruisers \\nhad failed to get the savage blacks to listen to reason. Four times the missionary \\nsocieties had essayed the peaceful conquest of the island, and four times, \\nbetween sickness and massacre, they had been driven away, More cruisers, more \\npacifications, had followed, and followed fruitlessly. The cannibals had always \\nretreated into the bush and laughed at the screaming shells. When the warships \\nleft it was an easy matter to rebuild the burned grass houses and set up the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n64 \\novens in the old-fashioned way. \\n \\nNew Gibbon was a large island, fully one hundred and fifty miles long and half as \\nbroad. \\n \\nIts windward coast was iron-bound, without anchorages or inlets, and it was \\ninhabited by scores of warring tribes--at least it had been, until Koho had arisen, \\nlike a Kamehameha, and, by force of arms and considerable statecraft, firmly \\nwelded the greater portion of the tribes into a confederation. His policy of \\npermitting no intercourse with white men had been eminently right, so far as \\nsurvival of his own people was concerned; and after the visit of the last cruiser he \\nhad had his own way until David Grief and McTavish the Trouble-mender landed \\non the deserted beach where once had stood the German bungalow and barracks \\nand the various English mission-houses. \\n \\nFollowed wars, false peaces, and more wars. The weazened little Scotchman could \\nmake trouble as well as mend it, and, not content with holding the beach, he \\nimported bushmen from Malaita and invaded the wild-pig runs of the interior \\njungle. He burned villages until Koho wearied of rebuilding them, and when he \\ncaptured Koho\\'s eldest son he compelled a conference with the old chief. It was \\nthen that McTavish laid down the rate of head-exchange. For each head of his \\nown people he promised to take ten of Koho\\'s. After Koho had learned that the \\nScotchman was a man of his word, the first true peace was made. In the \\nmeantime McTavish had built the bungalow and barracks, cleared the jungle-\\nland along the beach, and laid out the plantation. After that he had gone on his \\nway to mend trouble on the atoll of Tasman, where a plague of black measles had \\nbroken out and been ascribed to Grief\\'s plantation by the devil-devil doctors. \\nOnce, a year later, he had been called back again to straighten up New Gibbon; \\nand Koho, after paying a forced fine of two hundred thousand cocoanuts, decided \\nit was cheaper to keep the peace and sell the nuts. Also, the fires of his youth had \\nburned down. He was getting old and limped of one leg where a Lee-Enfield bullet \\nhad perforated the calf. \\n \\nII \\n \\n\"I knew a chap in Hawaii,\" Grief said, \"superintendent of a sugar plantation, who \\nused a hammer and a ten-penny nail.\" \\n \\nThey were sitting on the broad bungalow veranda, and watching Worth, the \\nmanager of New Gibbon, doctoring the sick squad. They were New Georgia boys, a \\ndozen of them, and the one with the aching tooth had been put back to the last. \\nWorth had just failed in his first attempt. He wiped the sweat from his forehead \\nwith one hand and waved the forceps with the other. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n65 \\n \\n\"And broke more than one jaw,\" he asserted grimly. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. Wallenstein smiled and elevated his brows. \\n \\n\"He said not, at any rate,\" Grief qualified. \"He assured me, furthermore, that he \\nalways succeeded on the first trial.\" \\n \\n\"I saw it done when I was second mate on a lime-juicer,\" Captain Ward spoke up. \\n\"The old man used a caulking mallet and a steel marlin-spike. He took the tooth \\nout with the first stroke, too, clean as a whistle.\" \\n \\n\"Me for the forceps,\" Worth muttered grimly, inserting his own pair in the mouth \\nof the black. As he pulled, the man groaned and rose in the air. \"Lend a hand, \\nsomebody, and hold him down,\" the manager appealed. \\n \\nGrief and Wallenstein, on either side, gripped the black and held him. And he, in \\nturn, struggled against them and clenched his teeth on the forceps. The group \\nswayed back and forth. Such exertion, in the stagnant heat, brought the sweat \\nout on all of them. The black sweated, too, but his was the sweat of excruciating \\npain. The chair on which he sat was overturned. Captain Ward paused in the act \\nof pouring himself a drink, and called encouragement. Worth pleaded with his \\nassistants to hang on, and hung on himself, twisting the tooth till it crackled and \\nthen attempting a straightaway pull. \\n \\nNor did any of them notice the little black man who limped up the steps and \\nstood looking on. Koho was a conservative. His fathers before him had worn no \\nclothes, and neither did he, not even a gee-string. The many empty perforations \\nin nose and lips and ears told of decorative passions long since dead. The holes \\non both ear-lobes had been torn out, but their size was attested by the strips of \\nwithered flesh that hung down and swept his shoulders. He cared now only for \\nutility, and in one of the half dozen minor holes in his right ear he carried a short \\nclay pipe. Around his waist was buckled a cheap trade-belt, and between the \\nimitation leather and the naked skin was thrust the naked blade of a long knife. \\nSuspended from the belt was his bamboo betel-nut and lime box. In his hand was \\na short-barrelled, large-bore Snider rifle. He was indescribably filthy, and here \\nand there marred by scars, the worst being the one left by the Lee-Enfield bullet, \\nwhich had withered the calf to half the size of its mate. His shrunken mouth \\nshowed that few teeth were left to serve him. Face and body were shrunken and \\nwithered, but his black, bead-like eyes, small and close together, were very \\nbright, withal they were restless and querulous, and more like a monkey\\'s than a \\nman\\'s. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n66 \\nHe looked on, grinning like a shrewd little ape. His joy in the torment of the \\npatient was natural, for the world he lived in was a world of pain. He had endured \\nhis share of it, and inflicted far more than his share on others. When the tooth \\nparted from its locked hold in the jaw and the forceps raked across the other \\nteeth and out of the mouth with a nerve-rasping sound, old Koho\\'s eyes fairly \\nsparkled, and he looked with glee at the poor black, collapsed on the veranda \\nfloor and groaning terribly as he held his head in both his hands. \\n \\n\"I think he\\'s going to faint,\" Grief said, bending over the victim. \"Captain Ward, \\ngive him a drink, please. You\\'d better take one yourself, Worth; you\\'re shaking \\nlike a leaf.\" \\n \\n\"And I think I\\'ll take one,\" said Wallenstein, wiping the sweat from his face. His \\neye caught the shadow of Koho on the floor and followed it up to the old chief \\nhimself. \"Hello! who\\'s this?\" \\n \\n\"Hello, Koho!\" Grief said genially, though he knew better than to offer to shake \\nhands. \\n \\nIt was one of Koho\\'s tambos, given him by the devil-devil doctors when he was \\nborn, that never was his flesh to come in contact with the flesh of a white man. \\nWorth and Captain Ward, of the Wonder, greeted Koho, but Worth frowned at \\nsight of the Snider, for it was one of his tambos that no visiting bushman should \\ncarry a weapon on the plantation. Rifles had a nasty way of going off at the hip \\nunder such circumstances. The manager clapped his hands, and a black house-\\nboy, recruited from San Cristobal, came running. At a sign from Worth, he took \\nthe rifle from the visitor\\'s hand and carried it inside the bungalow. \\n \\n\"Koho,\" Grief said, introducing the German Resident, \"this big fella marster \\nbelong Bougainville--my word, big fella marster too much.\" \\n \\nKoho, remembering the visits of the various German cruisers, smiled with a light \\nof unpleasant reminiscence in his eyes. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t shake hands with him, Wallenstein,\" Grief warned. \"Tambo, you know.\" \\nThen to Koho, \"My word, you get \\'m too much fat stop along you. Bime by you \\nmarry along new fella Mary, eh?\" \\n \\n\"Too old fella me,\" Koho answered, with a weary shake of the head. \"Me no like \\'m \\nMary. Me no like \\'m kai-kai (food). Close up me die along altogether.\" He stole a \\nsignificant glance at Worth, whose head was tilted back to a long glass. \"Me like \\n\\'m rum.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n67 \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"Tambo along black fella.\" \\n \\n\"He black fella no tambo,\" Koho retorted, nodding toward the groaning labourer. \\n \\n\"He fella sick,\" Grief explained. \\n \\n\"Me fella sick.\" \\n \\n\"You fella big liar,\" Grief laughed. \"Rum tambo, all the time tambo. Now, Koho, we \\nhave big fella talk along this big fella mar-ster.\" \\n \\nAnd he and Wallenstein and the old chief sat down on the veranda to confer \\nabout affairs of state. Koho was complimented on the peace he had kept, and he, \\nwith many protestations of his aged decrepitude, swore peace again and \\neverlasting. Then was discussed the matter of starting a German plantation \\ntwenty miles down the coast. The land, of course, was to be bought from Koho, \\nand the price was arranged in terms of tobacco, knives, beads, pipes, hatchets, \\nporpoise teeth and shell-money--in terms of everything except rum. While the talk \\nwent on, Koho, glancing through the window, could see Worth mixing medicines \\nand placing bottles back in the medicine cupboard. Also, he saw the manager \\ncomplete his labours by taking a drink of Scotch. Koho noted the bottle carefully. \\nAnd, though he hung about for an hour after the conference was over, there was \\nnever a moment when some one or another was not in the room. When Grief and \\nWorth sat down to a business talk, Koho gave it up. \\n \\n\"Me go along schooner,\" he announced, then turned and limped out. \\n \\n\"How are the mighty fallen,\" Grief laughed. \"To think that used to be Koho, the \\nfiercest red-handed murderer in the Solomons, who defied all his life two of the \\ngreatest world powers. And now he\\'s going aboard to try and cadge Denby for a \\ndrink.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n68 \\nIII \\n \\nFor the last time in his life the supercargo of the Wonder perpetrated a practical \\njoke on a native. He was in the main cabin, checking off the list of goods being \\nlanded in the whaleboats, when Koho limped down the com-panionway and took \\na seat opposite him at the table. \\n \\n\"Close up me die along altogether,\" was the burden of the old chief\\'s plaint. All \\nthe delights of the flesh had forsaken him. \"Me no like \\'m Mary. Me no like \\'m kai-\\nkai. Me too much sick fella. Me close up finish.\" A long, sad pause, in which his \\nface expressed unutterable concern for his stomach, which he patted gingerly and \\nwith an assumption of pain. \"Belly belong me too much sick.\" Another pause, \\nwhich was an invitation to Denby to make suggestions. Then followed a long, \\nweary, final sigh, and a \"Me like \\'m rum.\" \\n \\nDenby laughed heartlessly. He had been cadged for drinks before by the old \\ncannibal, and the sternest tambo Grief and McTavish had laid down was the one \\nforbidding alcohol to the natives of New Gibbon. \\n \\nThe trouble was that Koho had acquired the taste. In his younger days he had \\nlearned the delights of drunkenness when he cut off the schooner Dorset, but \\nunfortunately he had learned it along with all his tribesmen, and the supply had \\nnot held out long. Later, when he led his naked warriors down to the destruction \\nof the German plantation, he was wiser, and he appropriated all the liquors for \\nhis sole use. The result had been a gorgeous mixed drunk, on a dozen different \\nsorts of drink, ranging from beer doctored with quinine to absinthe and apricot \\nbrandy. The drunk had lasted for months, and it had left him with a thirst that \\nwould remain with him until he died. Predisposed toward alcohol, after the way of \\nsavages, all the chemistry of his flesh clamoured for it. This craving was to him \\nexpressed in terms of tingling and sensation, of maggots crawling warmly and \\ndeliciously in his brain, of good feeling, and well being, and high exultation. And \\nin his barren old age, when women and feasting were a weariness, and when old \\nhates had smouldered down, he desired more and more the revivifying fire that \\ncame liquid out of bottles--out of all sorts of bottles--for he remembered them \\nwell. He would sit in the sun for hours, occasionally drooling, in mournful \\ncontemplation of the great orgy which had been his when the German plantation \\nwas cleaned out. \\n \\nDenby was sympathetic. He sought out the old chief\\'s symptoms and offered him \\ndyspeptic tablets from the medicine chest, pills, and a varied assortment of \\nharmless tabloids and capsules. But Koho steadfastly declined. Once, when he \\ncut the Dorset off, he had bitten through a capsule of quinine; in addition, two of \\nhis warriors had partaken of a white powder and laid down and died very \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n69 \\nviolently in a very short time. No; he did not believe in drugs. But the liquids from \\nbottles, the cool-flaming youth-givers and warm-glowing dream-makers. No \\nwonder the white men valued them so highly and refused to dispense them. \\n \\n\"Rum he good fella,\" he repeated over and over, plaintively and with the weary \\npatience of age. \\n \\nAnd then Denby made his mistake and played his joke. Stepping around behind \\nKoho, he unlocked the medicine closet and took out a four-ounce bottle labelled \\nessence of mustard. As he made believe to draw the cork and drink of the \\ncontents, in the mirror on the for\\'ard bulkhead he glimpsed Koho, twisted half \\naround, intently watching him. Denby smacked his lips and cleared his throat \\nappreciatively as he replaced the bottle. Neglecting to relock the medicine closet, \\nhe returned to his chair, and, after a decent interval, went on deck. He stood \\nbeside the companionway and listened. After several moments the silence below \\nwas broken by a fearful, wheezing, propulsive, strangling cough. He smiled to \\nhimself and returned leisurely down the companionway. The bottle was back on \\nthe shelf where it belonged, and the old man sat in the same position. Denby \\nmarvelled at his iron control. Mouth and lips and tongue, and all sensitive \\nmembranes, were a blaze of fire. He gasped and nearly coughed several times, \\nwhile involuntary tears brimmed in his eyes and ran down his cheeks. An \\nordinary man would have coughed and strangled for half an hour. But old Koho\\'s \\nface was grimly composed. It dawned on him that a trick had been played, and \\ninto his eyes came an expression of hatred and malignancy so primitive, so \\nabysmal, that it sent the chills up and down Denby\\'s spine. Koho arose proudly. \\n \\n\"Me go along,\" he said. \"You sing out one fella boat stop along me.\" \\n \\nIV \\n \\nHaving seen Grief and Worth start for a ride over the plantation, Wallenstein sat \\ndown in the big living-room and with gun-oil and old rags proceeded to take apart \\nand clean his automatic pistol. On the table beside him stood the inevitable bottle \\nof Scotch and numerous soda bottles. Another bottle, part full, chanced to stand \\nthere. It was also labelled Scotch, but its content was liniment which Worth had \\nmixed for the horses and neglected to put away. \\n \\nAs Wallenstein worked, he glanced through the window and saw Koho coming up \\nthe compound path. He was limping very rapidly, but when he came along the \\nveranda and entered the room his gait was slow and dignified. He sat down and \\nwatched the gun-cleaning, Though mouth and lips and tongue were afire, he gave \\nno sign. At the end of five minutes he spoke. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n70 \\n\"Rum he good fella. Me like \\'m rum.\" Wallenstein smiled and shook his head, and \\nthen it was that his perverse imp suggested what was to be his last joke on a \\nnative. The similarity of the two bottles was the real suggestion. He laid his pistol \\nparts on the table and mixed himself a long drink. Standing as he did between \\nKoho and the table, he interchanged the two bottles, drained his glass, made as if \\nto search for something, and left the room. From outside he heard the surprised \\nsplutter and cough; but when he returned the old chief sat as before. The \\nliniment in the bottle, however, was lower, and it still oscillated. \\n \\nKoho stood up, clapped his hands, and, when the house-boy answered, signed \\nthat he desired his rifle. The boy fetched the weapon, and according to custom \\npreceded the visitor down the pathway. Not until outside the gate did the boy \\nturn the rifle over to its owner. Wallenstein, chuckling to himself, watched the old \\nchief limp along the beach in the direction of the river. \\n \\nA few minutes later, as he put his pistol together, Wallenstein heard the distant \\nreport of a gun. For the instant he thought of Koho, then dismissed the \\nconjecture from his mind. Worth and Grief had taken shotguns with them, and it \\nwas probably one of their shots at a pigeon. Wallenstein lounged back in his \\nchair, chuckled, twisted his yellow mustache, and dozed. He was aroused by the \\nexcited voice of Worth, crying out: \\n \\n\"Ring the big fella bell! Ring plenty too much! Ring like hell!\" \\n \\nWallenstein gained the veranda in time to see the manager jump his horse over \\nthe low fence of the compound and dash down the beach after Grief, who was \\nriding madly ahead. A loud crackling and smoke rising through the cocoanut \\ntrees told the story. The boat-houses and the barracks were on fire. The big \\nplantation bell was ringing wildly as the German Resident ran down the beach, \\nand he could see whaleboats hastily putting off from the schooner. \\n \\nBarracks and boat-houses, grass-thatched and like tinder, were wrapped in \\nflames. Grief emerged from the kitchen, carrying a naked black child by the leg. \\nIts head was missing. \\n \\n\"The cook\\'s in there,\" he told Worth. \"Her head\\'s gone, too. She was too heavy, \\nand I had to clear out.\" \\n \\n\"It was my fault,\" Wallenstein said. \"Old Koho did it. But I let him take a drink of \\nWorth\\'s horse liniment.\" \\n \\n\"I guess he\\'s headed for the bush,\" Worth said, springing astride his horse and \\nstarting. \"Oliver is down there by the river. Hope he didn\\'t get him.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n71 \\n \\nThe manager galloped away through the trees. A few minutes later, as the \\ncharred wreck of the barracks crashed in, they heard him calling and followed. \\nOn the edge of the river bank they came upon him. He still sat on his horse, very \\nwhite-faced, and gazed at something on the ground. It was the body of Oliver, the \\nyoung assistant manager, though it was hard to realize it, for the head was gone. \\nThe black labourers, breathless from their run in from the fields, were now \\ncrowding around, and under conches to-night, and the war-drums, \"all merry hell \\nwill break loose. They won\\'t rush us, but keep all the boys close up to the house, \\nMr. Worth. Come on!\" \\n \\nAs they returned along the path they came upon a black who whimpered and \\ncried vociferously. \\n \\n\"Shut up mouth belong you!\" Worth shouted. \"What name you make \\'m noise?\" \\n \\n\"Him fella Koho finish along two fella bulla-macow,\" the black answered, drawing \\na forefinger significantly across his throat. \\n \\n\"He\\'s knifed the cows,\" Grief said. \"That means no more milk for some time for \\nyou, Worth. I\\'ll see about sending a couple up from Ugi.\" \\n \\nWallenstein proved inconsolable, until Denby, coming ashore, confessed to the \\ndose of essence of mustard. Thereat the German Resident became even cheerful, \\nthough he twisted his yellow mustache up more fiercely and continued to curse \\nthe Solomons with oaths culled from four languages. \\n \\nNext morning, visible from the masthead of the Wonder, the bush was alive with \\nsignal-smokes. From promontory to promontory, and back through the solid \\njungle, the smoke-pillars curled and puffed and talked. Remote villages on the \\nhigher peaks, beyond the farthest raids McTavish had ever driven, joined in the \\ntroubled conversation. From across the river persisted a bedlam of conches; while \\nfrom everywhere, drifting for miles along the quiet air, came the deep, booming \\nreverberations of the great war-drums--huge tree trunks, hollowed by fire and \\ncarved with tools of stone and shell. \"You\\'re all right as long as you stay close,\" \\nGrief told his manager. \"I\\'ve got to get along to Guvutu. They won\\'t come out in \\nthe open and attack you. Keep the work-gangs close. Stop the clearing till this \\nblows over. They\\'ll get any detached gangs you send out. And, whatever you do, \\ndon\\'t be fooled into going into the bush after Koho. If you do, he\\'ll get you. All \\nyou\\'ve got to do is wait for McTavish. I\\'ll send him up with a bunch of his Malaita \\nbush-men. He\\'s the only man who can go inside. Also, until he comes, I\\'ll leave \\nDenby with you. You don\\'t mind, do you, Mr. Denby? I\\'ll send McTavish up with \\nthe Wanda, and you can go back on her and rejoin the Wonder. Captain Ward \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n72 \\ncan manage without you for a trip.\" \\n \\n\"It was just what I was going to volunteer,\" Denby answered. \"I never dreamed all \\nthis muss would be kicked up over a joke. You see, in a way I consider myself \\nresponsible for it.\" \\n \\n\"So am I responsible,\" Wallenstein broke in. \\n \\n\"But I started it,\" the supercargo urged. \\n \\n\"Maybe you did, but I carried it along.\" \\n \\n\"And Koho finished it,\" Grief said. \\n \\n\"At any rate, I, too, shall remain,\" said the German. \\n \\n\"I thought you were coming to Guvutu with me,\" Grief protested. \\n \\n\"I was. But this is my jurisdiction, partly, and I have made a fool of myself in it \\ncompletely. I shall remain and help get things straight again.\" \\n \\nAt Guvutu, Grief sent full instructions to McTavish by a recruiting ketch which \\nwas just starting for Malaita. Captain Ward sailed in the Wonder for the Santa \\nCruz Islands; and Grief, borrowing a whaleboat and a crew of black prisoners \\nfrom the British Resident, crossed the channel to Guadalcanar, to examine the \\ngrass lands back of Penduffryn. \\n \\nThree weeks later, with a free sheet and a lusty breeze, he threaded the coral \\npatches and surged up the smooth water to Guvutu anchorage. The harbour was \\ndeserted, save for a small ketch which lay close in to the shore reef. Grief \\nrecognized it as the Wanda. She had evidently just got in by the Tulagi Passage, \\nfor her black crew was still at work furling the sails. As he rounded alongside, \\nMcTavish himself extended a hand to help him over the rail. \\n \\n\"What\\'s the matter?\" Grief asked. \"Haven\\'t you started yet?\" \\n \\nMcTavish nodded. \"And got back. Everything\\'s all right on board.\" \\n \\n\"How\\'s New Gibbon?\" \\n \\n\"All there, the last I saw of it, barrin\\' a few inconsequential frills that a good eye \\ncould make out lacking from the landscape.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n73 \\nHe was a cold flame of a man, small as Koho, and as dried up, with a mahogany \\ncomplexion and small, expressionless blue eyes that were more like gimlet-points \\nthan the eyes of a Scotchman. Without fear, without enthusiasm, impervious to \\ndisease and climate and sentiment, he was lean and bitter and deadly as a snake. \\nThat his present sour look boded ill news, Grief was well aware. \\n \\n\"Spit it out!\" he said. \"What\\'s happened?\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis a thing severely to be condemned, a damned shame, this joking with \\nheathen niggers,\" was the reply. \"Also, \\'tis very expensive. Come below, Mr. Grief. \\nYou\\'ll be better for the information with a long glass in your hand. After you.\" \\n \\n\"How did you settle things?\" his employer demanded as soon as they were seated \\nin the cabin. \\n \\nThe little Scotchman shook his head. \"There was nothing to settle. It all depends \\nhow you look at it. The other way would be to say it was settled, entirely settled, \\nmind you, before I got there.\" \\n \\n\"But the plantation, man? The plantation?\" \\n \\n\"No plantation. All the years of our work have gone for naught. \\'Tis back where we \\nstarted, where the missionaries started, where the Germans started--and where \\nthey finished. Not a stone stands on another at the landing pier. The houses are \\nblack ashes. Every tree is hacked down, and the wild pigs are rooting out the \\nyams and sweet potatoes. Those boys from New Georgia, a fine bunch they were, \\nfive score of them, and they cost you a pretty penny. Not one is left to tell the \\ntale.\" \\n \\nHe paused and began fumbling in a large locker under the companion-steps. \\n \\n\"But Worth? And Denby? And Wallenstein?\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s what I\\'m telling you. Take a look.\" \\n \\nMcTavish dragged out a sack made of rice matting and emptied its contents on \\nthe floor. David Grief pulled himself together with a jerk, for he found himself \\ngazing fascinated at the heads of the three men he had left at New Gibbon. The \\nyellow mustache of Wallenstein had lost its fierce curl and drooped and wilted on \\nthe upper lip. \\n \\n\"I don\\'t know how it happened,\" the Scotchman\\'s voice went on drearily. \"But I \\nsurmise they went into the bush after the old devil.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n74 \\n \\n\"And where is Koho?\" Grief asked. \\n \\n\"Back in the bush and drunk as a lord. That\\'s how I was able to recover the \\nheads. He was too drunk to stand. They lugged him on their backs out of the \\nvillage when I rushed it. And if you\\'ll relieve me of the heads, I\\'ll be well obliged.\" \\nHe paused and sighed. \"I suppose they\\'ll have regular funerals over them and put \\nthem in the ground. But in my way of thinking they\\'d make excellent curios. Any \\nrespectable museum would pay a hundred quid apiece. Better have another \\ndrink. You\\'re looking a bit pale---- There, put that down you, and if you\\'ll take my \\nadvice, Mr. Grief, I would say, set your face sternly against any joking with the \\nniggers. It always makes trouble, and it is a very expensive divertisement.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n75 \\n \\nChapter Five--A LITTLE ACCOUNT WITH SWITHIN HALL \\n \\n I \\n \\nWith a last long scrutiny at the unbroken circle of the sea, David Grief swung out \\nof the cross-trees and slowly and dejectedly descended the ratlines to the deck. \\n \\n\"Leu-Leu Atoll is sunk, Mr. Snow,\" he said to the anxious-faced young mate. \"If \\nthere is anything in navigation, the atoll is surely under the sea, for we\\'ve sailed \\nclear over it twice--or the spot where it ought to be. It\\'s either that or the \\nchronometer\\'s gone wrong, or I\\'ve forgotten my navigation.\" \\n \\n\"It must be the chronometer, sir,\" the mate reassured his owner. \"You know I \\nmade separate sights and worked them up, and that they agreed with yours.\" \\n \\n\"Yes,\" Grief muttered, nodding glumly, \"and where your Summer lines crossed, \\nand mine, too, was the dead centre of Leu-Leu Atoll. It must be the chronometer--\\nslipped a cog or something.\" \\n \\nHe made a short pace to the rail and back, and cast a troubled eye at the Uncle \\nToby\\'s wake. The schooner, with a fairly strong breeze on her quarter, was logging \\nnine or ten knots. \\n \\n\"Better bring her up on the wind, Mr. Snow. Put her under easy sail and let her \\nwork to windward on two-hour legs. It\\'s thickening up, and I don\\'t imagine we \\ncan get a star observation to-night; so we\\'ll just hold our weather position, get a \\nlatitude sight to-morrow, and run Leu-Leu down on her own latitude. That\\'s the \\nway all the old navigators did.\" \\n \\nBroad of beam, heavily sparred, with high freeboard and bluff, Dutchy bow, the \\nUncle Toby was the slowest, tubbiest, safest, and most fool-proof schooner David \\nGrief possessed. Her run was in the Banks and Santa Cruz groups and to the \\nnorthwest among the several isolated atolls where his native traders collected \\ncopra, hawksbill turtle, and an occasional ton of pearl shell. Finding the skipper \\ndown with a particularly bad stroke of fever, Grief had relieved him and taken the \\nUncle Toby on her semiannual run to the atolls. He had elected to make his first \\ncall at Leu-Leu, which lay farthest, and now found himself lost at sea with a \\nchronometer that played tricks. \\n \\nII \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n76 \\nNo stars showed that night, nor was the sun visible next day. A stuffy, sticky \\ncalm obtained, broken by big wind-squalls and heavy downpours. From fear of \\nworking too far to windward, the Uncle Toby was hove to, and four days and \\nnights of cloud-hidden sky followed. Never did the sun appear, and on the several \\noccasions that stars broke through they were too dim and fleeting for \\nidentification. By this time it was patent to the veriest tyro that the elements were \\npreparing to break loose. Grief, coming on deck from consulting the barometer, \\nwhich steadfastly remained at 29.90, encountered Jackie-Jackie, whose face was \\nas brooding and troublous as the sky and air. Jackie-Jackie, a Tongan sailor of \\nexperience, served as a sort of bosun and semi-second mate over the mixed \\nKanaka crew. \\n \\n\"Big weather he come, I think,\" he said. \"I see him just the same before maybe \\nfive, six times.\" \\n \\nGrief nodded. \"Hurricane weather, all right, Jackie-Jackie. Pretty soon barometer \\ngo down--bottom fall out.\" \\n \\n\"Sure,\" the Tongan concurred. \"He goin\\' to blow like hell.\" \\n \\nTen minutes later Snow came on deck. \\n \\n\"She\\'s started,\" he said; \"29.85, going down and pumping at the same time. It\\'s \\nstinking hot--don\\'t you notice it?\" He brushed his forehead with his hands. \"It\\'s \\nsickening. I could lose my breakfast without trying.\" \\n \\nJackie-Jackie grinned. \"Just the same me. Everything inside walk about. Always \\nthis way before big blow. But Uncle Toby all right. He go through anything.\" \\n \\n\"Better rig that storm-trysail on the main, and a storm-jib,\" Grief said to the \\nmate. \"And put all the reefs into the working canvas before you furl down. No \\ntelling what we may need. Put on double gaskets while you\\'re about it.\" \\n \\nIn another hour, the sultry oppressiveness steadily increasing and the stark calm \\nstill continuing, the barometer had fallen to 29.70. The mate, being young, lacked \\nthe patience of waiting for the portentous. He ceased his restless pacing, and \\nwaved his arms. \\n \\n\"If she\\'s going to come let her come!\" he cried. \"There\\'s no use shilly-shallying this \\nway! Whatever the worst is, let us know it and have it! A pretty pickle--lost with a \\ncrazy chronometer and a hurricane that won\\'t blow!\" \\n \\nThe cloud-mussed sky turned to a vague copper colour, and seemed to glow as \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n77 \\nthe inside of a huge heated caldron. Nobody remained below. The native sailors \\nformed in anxious groups amidships and for\\'ard, where they talked in low voices \\nand gazed apprehensively at the ominous sky and the equally ominous sea that \\nbreathed in long, low, oily undulations. \\n \\n\"Looks like petroleum mixed with castor oil,\" the mate grumbled, as he spat his \\ndisgust overside. \"My mother used to dose me with messes like that when I was a \\nkid. Lord, she\\'s getting black!\" \\n \\nThe lurid coppery glow had vanished, and the sky thickened and lowered until \\nthe darkness was as that of a late twilight. David Grief, who well knew the \\nhurricane rules, nevertheless reread the \"Laws of Storms,\" screwing his eyes in \\nthe faint light in order to see the print. There was nothing to be done save wait for \\nthe wind, so that he might know how he lay in relation to the fast-flying and \\ndeadly centre that from somewhere was approaching out of the gloom. \\n \\nIt was three in the afternoon, and the glass had sunk to 29:45, when the wind \\ncame. They could see it on the water, darkening the face of the sea, crisping tiny \\nwhitecaps as it rushed along. It was merely a stiff breeze, and the Uncle Toby, \\nfilling away under her storm canvas till the wind was abeam, sloshed along at a \\nfour-knot gait. \\n \\n\"No weight to that,\" Snow sneered. \"And after such grand preparation!\" \\n \\n\"Pickaninny wind,\" Jackie-Jackie agreed. \"He grow big man pretty quick, you \\nsee.\" \\n \\nGrief ordered the foresail put on, retaining the reefs, and the Uncle Toby mended \\nher pace in the rising breeze. The wind quickly grew to man\\'s size, but did not \\nstop there. It merely blew hard, and harder, and kept on blowing harder, \\nadvertising each increase by lulls followed by fierce, freshening gusts. Ever it \\ngrew, until the Uncle Toby\\'s rail was more often pressed under than not, while \\nher waist boiled with foaming water which the scuppers could not carry off. Grief \\nstudied the barometer, still steadily falling. \\n \\n\"The centre is to the southward,\" he told Snow, \"and we\\'re running across its \\npath and into it. Now we\\'ll turn about and run the other way. That ought to bring \\nthe glass up. Take in the foresail--it\\'s more than she can carry already--and stand \\nby to wear her around.\" \\n \\nThe maneuver was accomplished, and through the gloom that was almost that of \\nthe first darkness of evening the Uncle Toby turned and raced madly north across \\nthe face of the storm. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n78 \\n \\n\"It\\'s nip and tuck,\" Grief confided to the mate a couple of hours later. \"The \\nstorm\\'s swinging a big curve--there\\'s no calculating that curve--and we may win \\nacross or the centre may catch us. Thank the Lord, the glass is holding its own. It \\nall depends on how big the curve is. The sea\\'s too big for us to keep on. Heave her \\nto! She\\'ll keep working along out anyway.\" \\n \\n\"I thought I knew what wind was,\" Snow shouted in his owner\\'s ear next morning. \\n\"This isn\\'t wind. It\\'s something unthinkable. It\\'s impossible. It must reach ninety \\nor a hundred miles an hour in the gusts. That don\\'t mean anything. How could I \\never tell it to anybody? I couldn\\'t. And look at that sea! I\\'ve run my Easting down, \\nbut I never saw anything like that.\" \\n \\nDay had come, and the sun should have been up an hour, yet the best it could \\nproduce was a sombre semi-twilight. The ocean was a stately procession of \\nmoving mountains. A third of a mile across yawned the valleys between the great \\nwaves. Their long slopes, shielded somewhat from the full fury of the wind, were \\nbroken by systems of smaller whitecapping waves, but from the high crests of the \\nbig waves themselves the wind tore the whitecaps in the forming. This spume \\ndrove masthead high, and higher, horizontally, above the surface of the sea. \\n \\n\"We\\'re through the worst,\" was Grief\\'s judgment. \"The glass is coming along all \\nthe time. The sea will get bigger as the wind eases down. I\\'m going to turn in. \\nWatch for shifts in the wind. They\\'ll be sure to come. Call me at eight bells.\" \\n \\nBy mid-afternoon, in a huge sea, with the wind after its last shift no more than a \\nstiff breeze, the Tongan bosun sighted a schooner bottom up. The Uncle Toby\\'s \\ndrift took them across the bow and they could not make out the name; but before \\nnight they picked up with a small, round-bottom, double-ender boat, swamped \\nbut with white lettering visible on its bow. Through the binoculars, Gray made \\nout: Emily L No. 3. \\n \\n\"A sealing schooner,\" Grief said. \"But what a sealer\\'s doing in these waters is \\nbeyond me.\" \\n \\n\"Treasure-hunters, maybe?\" Snow speculated. \"The Sophie Sutherland and the \\nHerman were sealers, you remember, chartered out of San Francisco by the \\nchaps with the maps who can always go right to the spot until they get there and \\ndon\\'t.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nAfter a giddy night of grand and lofty tumbling, in which, over a big and dying \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n79 \\nsea, without a breath of wind to steady her, the Uncle Toby rolled every person on \\nboard sick of soul, a light breeze sprang up and the reefs were shaken out. By \\nmidday, on a smooth ocean floor, the clouds thinned and cleared and sights of \\nthe sun were obtained. Two degrees and fifteen minutes south, the observation \\ngave them. With a broken chronometer longitude was out of the question. \\n \\n\"We\\'re anywhere within five hundred and a thousand miles along that latitude \\nline,\" Grief remarked, as he and the mate bent over the chart. \\n \\n\"Leu-Leu is to the south\\'ard somewhere, and this section of ocean is all blank. \\nThere is neither an island nor a reef by which we can regulate the chronometer. \\nThe only thing to do--\" \\n \\n\"Land ho, skipper!\" the Tongan called down the companionway. \\n \\nGrief took a quick glance at the empty blank of the chart, whistled his surprise, \\nand sank back feebly in a chair. \\n \\n\"It gets me,\" he said. \"There can\\'t be land around here. We never drifted or ran \\nlike that. The whole voyage has been crazy. Will you kindly go up, Mr. Snow, and \\nsee what\\'s ailing Jackie.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s land all right,\" the mate called down a minute afterward. \"You can see it from \\nthe deck--tops of cocoanuts--an atoll of some sort. Maybe it\\'s Leu-Leu after all.\" \\n \\nGrief shook his head positively as he gazed at the fringe of palms, only the tops \\nvisible, apparently rising out of the sea. \\n \\n\"Haul up on the wind, Mr. Snow, close-and-by, and we\\'ll take a look. We can just \\nreach past to the south, and if it spreads off in that direction we\\'ll hit the \\nsouthwest corner.\" \\n \\nVery near must palms be to be seen from the low deck of a schooner, and, slowly \\nas the Uncle Toby sailed, she quickly raised the low land above the sea, while \\nmore palms increased the definition of the atoll circle. \\n \\n\"She\\'s a beauty,\" the mate remarked. \"A perfect circle.... Looks as if it might be \\neight or nine miles across.... Wonder if there\\'s an entrance to the lagoon.... Who \\nknows? Maybe it\\'s a brand new find.\" \\n \\nThey coasted up the west side of the atoll, making short tacks in to the surf-\\npounded coral rock and out again. From the masthead, across the palm-fringe, a \\nKanaka announced the lagoon and a small island in the middle. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n80 \\n \\n\"I know what you\\'re thinking,\" Grief said to his mate. \\n \\nSnow, who had been muttering and shaking his head, looked up with quick and \\nchallenging incredulity. \\n \\n\"You\\'re thinking the entrance will be on the northwest.\" Grief went on, as if \\nreciting. \\n \\n\"Two cable lengths wide, marked on the north by three separated cocoanuts, and \\non the south by pandanus trees. Eight miles in diameter, a perfect circle, with an \\nisland in the dead centre.\" \\n \\n\"I was thinking that,\" Snow acknowledged. \\n \\n\"And there\\'s the entrance opening up just where it ought to be----\" \\n \\n\"And the three palms,\" Snow almost whispered, \"and the pandanus trees. If \\nthere\\'s a windmill on the island, it\\'s it--Swithin Hall\\'s island. But it can\\'t be. \\nEverybody\\'s been looking for it for the last ten years.\" \\n \\n\"Hall played you a dirty trick once, didn\\'t he?\" Grief queried. \\n \\nSnow nodded. \"That\\'s why I\\'m working for you. He broke me flat. It was \\ndownright robbery. I bought the wreck of the Cascade, down in Sydney, out of a \\nfirst instalment of a legacy from home.\" \\n \\n\"She went on Christmas Island, didn\\'t she?\" \\n \\n\"Yes, full tilt, high and dry, in the night. They saved the passengers and mails. \\nThen I bought a little island schooner, which took the rest of my money, and I \\nhad to wait the final payment by the executors to fit her out. What did Swithin \\nHall do--he was at Honolulu at the time--but make a straightaway run for \\nChristmas Island. Neither right nor title did he have. When I got there, the hull \\nand engines were all that was left of the Cascade. She had had a fair shipment of \\nsilk on board, too. And it wasn\\'t even damaged. I got it afterward pretty straight \\nfrom his supercargo. He cleared something like sixty thousand dollars.\" \\n \\nSnow shrugged his shoulders and gazed bleakly at the smooth surface of the \\nlagoon, where tiny wavelets danced in the afternoon sun. \\n \\n\"The wreck was mine. I bought her at public auction. I\\'d gambled big, and I\\'d lost. \\nWhen I got back to Sydney, the crew, and some of the tradesmen who\\'d extended \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n81 \\nme credit, libelled the schooner. I pawned my watch and sextant, and shovelled \\ncoal one spell, and finally got a billet in the New Hebrides on a screw of eight \\npounds a month. Then I tried my luck as independent trader, went broke, took a \\nmate\\'s billet on a recruiter down to Tanna and over to Fiji, got a job as overseer \\non a German plantation back of Apia, and finally settled down on the Uncle \\nToby.\" \\n \\n\"Have you ever met Swithin Hall?\" \\n \\nSnow shook his head. \\n \\n\"Well, you\\'re likely to meet him now. There\\'s the windmill.\" \\n \\nIn the centre of the lagoon, as they emerged from the passage, they opened a \\nsmall, densely wooded island, among the trees of which a large Dutch windmill \\nshowed plainly. \\n \\n\"Nobody at home from the looks of it,\" Grief said, \"or you might have a chance to \\ncollect.\" \\n \\nThe mate\\'s face set vindictively, and his fists clenched. \\n \\n\"Can\\'t touch him legally. He\\'s got too much money now. But I can take sixty \\nthousand dollars\\' worth out of his hide. I hope he is at home.\" \\n \\n\"Then I hope he is, too,\" Grief said, with an appreciative smile. \"You got the \\ndescription of his island from Bau-Oti, I suppose?\" \\n \\n\"Yes, as pretty well everybody else has. The trouble is that Bau-Oti can\\'t give \\nlatitude or longitude. Says they sailed a long way from the Gilberts--that\\'s all he \\nknows. I wonder what became of him.\" \\n \\n\"I saw him a year ago on the beach at Tahiti. Said he was thinking about shipping \\nfor a cruise through the Paumotus. Well, here we are, getting close in. Heave the \\nlead, Jackie-Jackie. Stand by to let go, Mr. Snow. According to Bau-Oti, \\nanchorage three hundred yards off the west shore in nine fathoms, coral patches \\nto the southeast. There are the patches. What do you get, Jackie?\" \\n \\n\"Nine fadom.\" \\n \\n\"Let go, Mr. Snow.\" \\n \\nThe Uncle Toby swung to her chain, head-sails ran down, and the Kanaka crew \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n82 \\nsprang to fore and main-halyards and sheets. \\n \\nIV \\n \\nThe whaleboat laid alongside the small, coral-stone landing-pier, and David Grief \\nand his mate stepped ashore. \\n \\n\"You\\'d think the place deserted,\" Grief said, as they walked up a sanded path to \\nthe bungalow. \"But I smell a smell that I\\'ve often smelled. Something doing, or my \\nnose is a liar. The lagoon is carpeted with shell. They\\'re rotting the meat out not a \\nthousand miles away. Get that whiff?\" \\n \\nLike no bungalow in the tropics was this bungalow of Swithin Hall. Of mission \\narchitecture, when they had entered through the unlatched screen door they \\nfound decoration and furniture of the same mission style. The floor of the big \\nliving-room was covered with the finest Samoan mats. There were couches, \\nwindow seats, cozy corners, and a billiard table. A sewing table, and a sewing-\\nbasket, spilling over with sheer linen in the French embroidery of which stuck a \\nneedle, tokened a woman\\'s presence. By screen and veranda the blinding \\nsunshine was subdued to a cool, dim radiance. The sheen of pearl push-buttons \\ncaught Grief\\'s eye. \\n \\n\"Storage batteries, by George, run by the windmill!\" he exclaimed as he pressed \\nthe buttons. \"And concealed lighting!\" \\n \\nHidden bowls glowed, and the room was filled with diffused golden light. Many \\nshelves of books lined the walls. Grief fell to running over their titles. A fairly well-\\nread man himself, for a sea-adventurer, he glimpsed a wide-ness of range and \\ncatholicity of taste that were beyond him. Old friends he met, and others that he \\nhad heard of but never read. There were complete sets of Tolstoy, Turgenieff, and \\nGorky; of Cooper and Mark Twain; of Hugo, and Zola, and Sue; and of Flaubert, \\nDe Maupassant, and Paul de Koch. He glanced curiously at the pages of \\nMetchnikoff, Weininger, and Schopenhauer, and wonderingly at those of Ellis, \\nLydston, Krafft-Ebbing, and Forel. Woodruff\\'s \"Expansion of Races\" was in his \\nhands when Snow returned from further exploration of the house. \\n \\n\"Enamelled bath-tub, separate room for a shower, and a sitz-bath!\" he exclaimed. \\n\"Fitted up for a king! And I reckon some of my money went to pay for it. The place \\nmust be occupied. I found fresh-opened butter and milk tins in the pantry, and \\nfresh turtle-meat hanging up. I\\'m going to see what else I can find.\" \\n \\nGrief, too, departed, through a door that led out of the opposite end of the living-\\nroom. He found himself in a self-evident woman\\'s bedroom. Across it, he peered \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n83 \\nthrough a wire-mesh door into a screened and darkened sleeping porch. On a \\ncouch lay a woman asleep. In the soft light she seemed remarkably beautiful in a \\ndark Spanish way. By her side, opened and face downward, a novel lay on a \\nchair. From the colour in her cheeks, Grief concluded that she had not been long \\nin the tropics. After the one glimpse he stole softly back, in time to see Snow \\nentering the living-room through the other door. By the naked arm he was \\nclutching an age-wrinkled black who grinned in fear and made signs of \\ndumbness. \\n \\n\"I found him snoozing in a little kennel out back,\" the mate said. \"He\\'s the cook, I \\nsuppose. Can\\'t get a word out of him. What did you find?\" \\n \\n\"A sleeping princess. S-sh! There\\'s somebody now.\" \\n \\n\"If it\\'s Hall,\" Snow muttered, clenching his fist. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"No rough-house. There\\'s a woman here. And if it is Hall, \\nbefore we go I\\'ll maneuver a chance for you to get action.\" \\n \\nThe door opened, and a large, heavily built man entered. In his belt was a heavy, \\nlong-barrelled Colt\\'s. One quick, anxious look he gave them, then his face \\nwreathed in a genial smile and his hand was extended. \\n \\n\"Welcome, strangers. But if you don\\'t mind my asking, how, by all that\\'s sacred, \\ndid you ever manage to find my island?\" \\n \\n\"Because we were out of our course,\" Grief answered, shaking hands. \\n \\n\"My name\\'s Hall, Swithin Hall,\" the other said, turning to shake Snow\\'s hand. \\n\"And I don\\'t mind telling you that you\\'re the first visitors I\\'ve ever had.\" \\n \\n\"And this is your secret island that\\'s had all the beaches talking for years?\" Grief \\nanswered. \"Well, I know the formula now for finding it.\" \\n \\n\"How\\'s that?\" Hall asked quickly. \\n \\n\"Smash your chronometer, get mixed up with a hurricane, and then keep your \\neyes open for cocoanuts rising out of the sea.\" \\n \\n\"And what is your name?\" Hall asked, after he had laughed perfunctorily. \\n \\n\"Anstey--Phil Anstey,\" Grief answered promptly. \"Bound on the Uncle Toby from \\nthe Gilberts to New Guinea, and trying to find my longitude. This is my mate, Mr. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n84 \\nGray, a better navigator than I, but who has lost his goat just the same to the \\nchronometer.\" \\n \\nGrief did not know his reason for lying, but he had felt the prompting and \\nsuccumbed to it. He vaguely divined that something was wrong, but could not \\nplace his finger on it. Swithin Hall was a fat, round-faced man, with a laughing \\nlip and laughter-wrinkles in the corners of his eyes. But Grief, in his early youth, \\nhad learned how deceptive this type could prove, as well as the deceptiveness of \\nblue eyes that screened the surface with fun and hid what went on behind. \\n \\n\"What are you doing with my cook?--lost yours and trying to shanghai him?\" Hall \\nwas saying. \"You\\'d better let him go, if you\\'re going to have any supper. My wife\\'s \\nhere, and she\\'ll be glad to meet you--dinner, she calls it, and calls me down for \\nmisnaming it, but I\\'m old fashioned. My folks always ate dinner in the middle of \\nthe day. Can\\'t get over early training. Don\\'t you want to wash up? I do. Look at \\nme. I\\'ve been working like a dog--out with the diving crew--shell, you know. But \\nof course you smelt it.\" \\n \\nV \\n \\nSnow pleaded charge of the schooner, and went on board. In addition to his \\nrepugnance at breaking salt with the man who had robbed him, it was necessary \\nfor him to impress the in-violableness of Grief\\'s lies on the Kanaka crew. By \\neleven o\\'clock Grief came on board, to find his mate waiting up for him. \\n \\n\"There\\'s something doing on Swithin Hall\\'s island,\" Grief said, shaking his head. \\n\"I can\\'t make out what it is, but I get the feel of it. What does Swithin Hall look \\nlike?\" \\n \\nSnow shook his head. \\n \\n\"That man ashore there never bought the books on the shelves,\" Grief declared \\nwith conviction. \"Nor did he ever go in for concealed lighting. He\\'s got a surface \\nflow of suavity, but he\\'s rough as a hoof-rasp underneath. He\\'s an oily bluff. And \\nthe bunch he\\'s got with him--Watson and Gorman their names are; they came in \\nafter you left--real sea-dogs, middle-aged, marred and battered, tough as rusty \\nwrought-iron nails and twice as dangerous; real ugly customers, with guns in \\ntheir belts, who don\\'t strike me as just the right sort to be on such comradely \\nterms with Swithin Hall. And the woman! She\\'s a lady. I mean it. She knows a \\nwhole lot of South America, and of China, too. I\\'m sure she\\'s Spanish, though her \\nEnglish is natural. She\\'s travelled. We talked bull-fights. She\\'s seen them in \\nGuayaquil, in Mexico, in Seville. She knows a lot about sealskins. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n85 \\n\"Now here\\'s what bothers me. She knows music. I asked her if she played. And \\nhe\\'s fixed that place up like a palace. That being so, why hasn\\'t he a piano for \\nher? Another thing: she\\'s quick and lively and he watches her whenever she \\ntalks. He\\'s on pins and needles, and continually breaking in and leading the \\nconversation. Say, did you ever hear that Swithin Hall was married?\" \\n \\n\"Bless me, I don\\'t know,\" the mate replied. \"Never entered my head to think about \\nit.\" \\n \\n\"He introduced her as Mrs. Hall. And Watson and Gorman call him Hall. They\\'re a \\nprecious pair, those two men. I don\\'t understand it at all.\" \\n \\n\"What are you going to do about it?\" Snow asked. \\n \\n\"Oh, hang around a while. There are some books ashore there I want to read. \\nSuppose you send that topmast down in the morning and generally overhaul. \\nWe\\'ve been through a hurricane, you know. Set up the rigging while you\\'re about \\nit. Get things pretty well adrift, and take your time.\" \\n \\n VI \\n \\nThe next day Grief\\'s suspicions found further food. Ashore early, he strolled \\nacross the little island to the barracks occupied by the divers. \\n \\nThey were just boarding the boats when he arrived, and it struck him that for \\nKanakas they behaved more like chain-gang prisoners. The three white men were \\nthere, and Grief noted that each carried a rifle. Hall greeted him jovially enough, \\nbut Gorman and Watson scowled as they grunted curt good mornings. \\n \\nA moment afterward one of the Kanakas, as he bent to place his oar, favoured \\nGrief with a slow, deliberate wink. The man\\'s face was familiar, one of the \\nthousands of native sailors and divers he had encountered drifting about in the \\nisland trade. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t tell them who I am,\" Grief said, in Tahitian. \"Did you ever sail for me?\" \\n \\nThe man\\'s head nodded and his mouth opened, but before he could speak he was \\nsuppressed by a savage \"Shut up!\" from Watson, who was already in the \\nsternsheets. \\n \\n\"I beg pardon,\" Grief said. \"I ought to have known better.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s all right,\" Hall interposed. \"The trouble is they\\'re too much talk and not \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n86 \\nenough work. Have to be severe with them, or they wouldn\\'t get enough shell to \\npay their grub.\" \\n \\nGrief nodded sympathetically. \"I know them. Got a crew of them myself--the lazy \\nswine. Got to drive them like niggers to get a half-day\\'s work out of them.\" \\n \\n\"What was you sayin\\' to him?\" Gorman blurted in bluntly. \\n \\n\"I was asking how the shell was, and how deep they were diving.\" \\n \\n\"Thick,\" Hall took over the answering. \"We\\'re working now in about ten fathom. \\nIt\\'s right out there, not a hundred yards off. Want to come along?\" \\n \\nHalf the day Grief spent with the boats, and had lunch in the bungalow. In the \\nafternoon he loafed, taking a siesta in the big living-room, reading some, and \\ntalking for half an hour with Mrs. Hall. After dinner, he played billiards with her \\nhusband. It chanced that Grief had never before encountered Swithin Hall, yet \\nthe latter\\'s fame as an expert at billiards was the talk of the beaches from Levuka \\nto Honolulu. But the man Grief played with this night proved most indifferent at \\nthe game. His wife showed herself far cleverer with the cue. \\n \\nWhen he went on board the Uncle Toby Grief routed Jackie-Jackie out of bed. He \\ndescribed the location of the barracks, and told the Tongan to swim softly around \\nand have talk with the Kanakas. In two hours Jackie-Jackie was back. He shook \\nhis head as he stood dripping before Grief. \\n \\n\"Very funny t\\'ing,\" he reported. \"One white man stop all the time. He has big rifle. \\nHe lay in water and watch. Maybe twelve o\\'clock, other white man come and take \\nrifle. First white man go to bed. Other man stop now with rifle. No good. Me \\ncannot talk with Kanakas. Me come back.\" \\n \\n\"By George!\" Grief said to Snow, after the Tongan had gone back to his bunk. \"I \\nsmell something more than shell. Those three men are standing watches over \\ntheir Kanakas. That man\\'s no more Swithin Hall than I am.\" \\n \\nSnow whistled from the impact of a new idea. \\n \\n\"I\\'ve got it!\" he cried. \\n \\n\"And I\\'ll name it,\" Grief retorted, \"It\\'s in your mind that the Emily L. was their \\nschooner?\" \\n \\n\"Just that. They\\'re raising and rotting the shell, while she\\'s gone for more divers, \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n87 \\nor provisions, or both.\" \\n \\n\"And I agree with you.\" Grief glanced at the cabin clock and evinced signs of bed-\\ngoing. \"He\\'s a sailor. The three of them are. But they\\'re not island men. They\\'re \\nnew in these waters.\" \\n \\nAgain Snow whistled. \\n \\n\"And the Emily L. is lost with all hands,\" he said. \"We know that. They\\'re \\nmarooned here till Swithin Hall comes. Then he\\'ll catch them with all the shell.\" \\n \\n\"Or they\\'ll take possession of his schooner.\" \\n \\n\"Hope they do!\" Snow muttered vindictively. \"Somebody ought to rob him. Wish I \\nwas in their boots. I\\'d balance off that sixty thousand.\" \\n \\nVII \\n \\nA week passed, during which time the Uncle Toby was ready for sea, while Grief \\nmanaged to allay any suspicion of him by the shore crowd. \\n \\nEven Gorman and Watson accepted him at his self-description. Throughout the \\nweek Grief begged and badgered them for the longitude of the island. \\n \\n\"You wouldn\\'t have me leave here lost,\" he finally urged. \"I can\\'t get a line on my \\nchronometer without your longitude.\" \\n \\nHall laughingly refused. \\n \\n\"You\\'re too good a navigator, Mr. Anstey, not to fetch New Guinea or some other \\nhigh land.\" \\n \\n\"And you\\'re too good a navigator, Mr. Hall,\" Grief replied, \"not to know that I can \\nfetch your island any time by running down its latitude.\" \\n \\nOn the last evening, ashore, as usual, to dinner, Grief got his first view of the \\npearls they had collected. Mrs. Hall, waxing enthusiastic, had asked her husband \\nto bring forth the \"pretties,\" and had spent half an hour showing them to Grief. \\nHis delight in them was genuine, as well as was his surprise that they had made \\nso rich a haul. \\n \\n\"The lagoon is virgin,\" Hall explained. \"You saw yourself that most of the shell is \\nlarge and old. But it\\'s funny that we got most of the valuable pearls in one small \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n88 \\npatch in the course of a week. It was a little treasure house. Every oyster seemed \\nfilled--seed pearls by the quart, of course, but the perfect ones, most of that \\nbunch there, came out of the small patch.\" \\n \\nGrief ran his eye over them and knew their value ranged from one hundred to a \\nthousand dollars each, while the several selected large ones went far beyond. \\n \\n\"Oh, the pretties! the pretties!\" Mrs. Hall cried, bending forward suddenly and \\nkissing them. \\n \\nA few minutes later she arose to say good-night. \\n \\n\"It\\'s good-bye,\" Grief said, as he took her hand. \"We sail at daylight.\" \\n \\n\"So suddenly!\" she cried, while Grief could not help seeing the quick light of \\nsatisfaction in her husband\\'s eyes. \\n \\n\"Yes,\" Grief continued. \"All the repairs are finished. I can\\'t get the longitude of \\nyour island out of your husband, though I\\'m still in hopes he\\'ll relent.\" \\n \\nHall laughed and shook his head, and, as his wife left the room, proposed a last \\nfarewell nightcap. They sat over it, smoking and talking. \\n \\n\"What do you estimate they\\'re worth?\" Grief asked, indicating the spread of pearls \\non the table. \"I mean what the pearl-buyers would give you in open market?\" \\n \\n\"Oh, seventy-five or eighty thousand,\" Hall said carelessly. \\n \\n\"I\\'m afraid you\\'re underestimating. I know pearls a bit. Take that biggest one. It\\'s \\nperfect. Not a cent less than five thousand dollars. Some multimillionaire will pay \\ndouble that some day, when the dealers have taken their whack. And never \\nminding the seed pearls, you\\'ve got quarts of baroques there. And baroques are \\ncoming into fashion. They\\'re picking up and doubling on themselves every year.\" \\n \\nHall gave the trove of pearls a closer and longer scrutiny, estimating the different \\nparcels and adding the sum aloud. \\n \\n\"You\\'re right,\" he admitted. \"They\\'re worth a hundred thousand right now.\" \\n \\n\"And at what do you figure your working expenses?\" Grief went on. \"Your time, \\nand your two men\\'s, and the divers\\'?\" \\n \\n\"Five thousand would cover it.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n89 \\n \\n\"Then they stand to net you ninety-five thousand?\" \\n \\n\"Something like that. But why so curious?\" \\n \\n\"Why, I was just trying----\" Grief paused and drained his glass. \"Just trying to \\nreach some sort of an equitable arrangement. Suppose I should give you and your \\npeople a passage to Sydney and the five thousand dollars--or, better, seven \\nthousand five hundred. You\\'ve worked hard.\" \\n \\nWithout commotion or muscular movement the other man became alert and \\ntense. His round-faced geniality went out like the flame of a snuffed candle. No \\nlaughter clouded the surface of the eyes, and in their depths showed the hard, \\ndangerous soul of the man. He spoke in a low, deliberate voice. \\n \\n\"Now just what in hell do you mean by that?\" \\n \\nGrief casually relighted his cigar. \\n \\n\"I don\\'t know just how to begin,\" he said. \"The situation is--er--is embarrassing \\nfor you. You see, I\\'m trying to be fair. As I say, you\\'ve worked hard. I don\\'t want to \\nconfiscate the pearls. I want to pay you for your time and trouble, and expense.\" \\n \\nConviction, instantaneous and absolute, froze on the other\\'s face. \\n \\n\"And I thought you were in Europe,\" he muttered. Hope flickered for a moment. \\n\"Look here, you\\'re joking me. How do I know you\\'re Swithin Hall?\" \\n \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders. \"Such a joke would be in poor taste, after your \\nhospitality. And it is equally in poor taste to have two Swithin Halls on the \\nisland.\" \\n \\n\"Since you\\'re Swithin Hall, then who the deuce am I? Do you know that, too?\" \\n \\n\"No,\" Grief answered airily. \"But I\\'d like to know.\" \\n \\n\"Well, it\\'s none of your business.\" \\n \\n\"I grant it. Your identity is beside the point. Besides, I know your schooner, and I \\ncan find out who you are from that.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s her name?\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n90 \\n\"The Emily L. \\n \\n\"Correct. I\\'m Captain Raffy, owner and master.\" \\n \\n\"The seal-poacher? I\\'ve heard of you. What under the sun brought you down here \\non my preserves?\" \\n \\n\"Needed the money. The seal herds are about finished.\" \\n \\n\"And the out-of-the-way places of the world are better policed, eh?\" \\n \\n\"Pretty close to it. And now about this present scrape, Mr. Hall. I can put up a \\nnasty fight. What are you going to do about it?\" \\n \\n\"What I said. Even better. What\\'s the Emily L. worth?\" \\n \\n\"She\\'s seen her day. Not above ten thousand, which would be robbery. Every time \\nshe\\'s in a rough sea I\\'m afraid she\\'ll jump her ballast through her planking.\" \\n \\n\"She has jumped it, Captain Raffy. I sighted her bottom-up after the blow. \\nSuppose we say she was worth seven thousand five hundred. I\\'ll pay over to you \\nfifteen thousand and give you a passage. Don\\'t move your hands from your lap.\" \\nGrief stood up, went over to him, and took his revolver. \"Just a necessary \\nprecaution, Captain. Now you\\'ll go on board with me. I\\'ll break the news to Mrs. \\nRaffy afterward, and fetch her out to join you.\" \\n \\n\"You\\'re behaving handsomely, Mr. Hall, I must say,\" Captain Raffy volunteered, \\nas the whaleboat came alongside the Uncle Toby. \"But watch out for Gorman and \\nWatson. They\\'re ugly customers. And, by the way, I don\\'t like to mention it, but \\nyou\\'ve seen my wife. I\\'ve given her four or five pearls. Watson and Gorman were \\nwilling.\" \\n \\n\"Say no more, Captain. Say no more. They shall remain hers. Is that you, Mr. \\nSnow? Here\\'s a friend I want you to take charge of--Captain Raffy. I\\'m going \\nashore for his wife.\" \\n \\nVIII \\n \\nDavid Grief sat writing at the library table in the bungalow living-room. Outside, \\nthe first pale of dawn was showing. He had had a busy night. Mrs. Raffy had \\ntaken two hysterical hours to pack her and Captain Raffy\\'s possessions.

At Goboto mail is received, bills are paid, and \\nnewspapers, rarely more than five weeks old, are accessible; for the little island, \\nbelted with its coral reefs, affords safe anchorage, is the steamer port of call, and \\nserves as the distributing point for the whole wide-scattered group. \\n \\nLife at Goboto is heated, unhealthy, and lurid, and for its size it asserts the \\ndistinction of more cases of acute alcoholism than any other spot in the world. \\nGuvutu, over in the Solomons, claims that it drinks between drinks. Goboto does \\nnot deny this. It merely states, in passing, that in the Goboton chronology no \\nsuch interval of time is known. It also points out its import statistics, which show \\na far larger per capita consumption of spiritous liquors. Guvutu explains this on \\nthe basis that Goboto does a larger business and has more visitors. Goboto \\nretorts that its resident population is smaller and that its visitors are thirstier. \\nAnd the discussion goes on interminably, principally because of the fact that the \\ndisputants do not live long enough to settle it. \\n \\nGoboto is not large. The island is only a quarter of a mile in diameter, and on it \\nare situated an admiralty coal-shed (where a few tons of coal have lain untouched \\nfor twenty years), the barracks for a handful of black labourers, a big store and \\nwarehouse with sheet-iron roofs, and a bungalow inhabited by the manager and \\nhis two clerks. They are the white population. An average of one man out of the \\nthree is always to be found down with fever. The job at Goboto is a hard one. It is \\nthe policy of the company to treat its patrons well, as invading companies have \\nfound out, and it is the task of the manager and clerks to do the treating. \\nThroughout the year traders and recruiters arrive from far, dry cruises, and \\nplanters from equally distant and dry shores, bringing with them magnificent \\nthirsts. Goboto is the mecca of sprees, and when they have spread they go back \\nto their schooners and plantations to recuperate. \\n \\nSome of the less hardy require as much as six months between visits. But for the \\nmanager and his assistants there are no such intervals. They are on the spot, and \\nweek by week, blown in by monsoon or southeast trade, the schooners come to \\nanchor, cargo'd with copra, ivory nuts, pearl-shell, hawksbill turtle, and thirst. \\n \\nIt is a very hard job at Goboto. That is why the pay is twice that on other stations, \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n94 \\nand that is why the company selects only courageous and intrepid men for this \\nparticular station. They last no more than a year or so, when the wreckage of \\nthem is shipped back to Australia, or the remains of them are buried in the sand \\nacross on the windward side of the islet. Johnny Bassett, almost the legendary \\nhero of Goboto, broke all records. He was a remittance man with a remarkable \\nconstitution, and he lasted seven years. His dying request was duly observed by \\nhis clerks, who pickled him in a cask of trade-rum (paid for out of their own \\nsalaries) and shipped him back to his people in England. Nevertheless, at Goboto, \\nthey tried to be gentlemen. For that matter, though something was wrong with \\nthem, they were gentlemen, and had been gentlemen. That was why the great \\nunwritten rule of Goboto was that visitors should put on pants and shoes. \\nBreech-clouts, lava-lavas, and bare legs were not tolerated. When Captain \\nJensen, the wildest of the Blackbirders though descended from old New York \\nKnickerbocker stock, surged in, clad in loin-cloth, undershirt, two belted \\nrevolvers and a sheath-knife, he was stopped at the beach. This was in the days \\nof Johnny Bassett, ever a stickler in matters of etiquette. Captain Jensen stood \\nup in the sternsheets of his whaleboat and denied the existence of pants on his \\nschooner. Also, he affirmed his intention of coming ashore. They of Goboto \\nnursed him back to health from a bullet-hole through his shoulder, and in \\naddition handsomely begged his pardon, for no pants had they found on his \\nschooner. And finally, on the first day he sat up, Johnny Bassett kindly but firmly \\nassisted his guest into a pair of pants of his own. This was the great precedent. In \\nall the succeeding years it had never been violated. White men and pants were \\nundivorce-able. Only niggers ran naked. Pants constituted caste. \\n \\nII \\n \\nOn this night things were, with one exception, in nowise different from any other \\nnight. Seven of them, with glimmering eyes and steady legs, had capped a day of \\nScotch with swivel-sticked cocktails and sat down to dinner. Jacketed, trousered, \\nand shod, they were: Jerry McMurtrey, the manager; Eddy Little and Jack \\nAndrews, clerks; Captain Stapler, of the recruiting ketch Merry; Darby Shryleton, \\nplanter from Tito-Ito; Peter Gee, a half-caste Chinese pearl-buyer who ranged \\nfrom Ceylon to the Paumotus, and Alfred Deacon, a visitor who had stopped off \\nfrom the last steamer. At first wine was served by the black servants to those that \\ndrank it, though all quickly shifted back to Scotch and soda, pickling their food \\nas they ate it, ere it went into their calcined, pickled stomachs. \\n \\nOver their coffee, they heard the rumble of an anchor-chain through a hawse-\\npipe, tokening the arrival of a vessel. \\n \\n\"It\\'s David Grief,\" Peter Gee remarked. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n95 \\n\"How do you know?\" Deacon demanded truculently, and then went on to deny the \\nhalf-caste\\'s knowledge. \"You chaps put on a lot of side over a new chum. I\\'ve done \\nsome sailing myself, and this naming a craft when its sail is only a blur, or \\nnaming a man by the sound of his anchor--it\\'s--it\\'s unadulterated poppycock.\" \\n \\nPeter Gee was engaged in lighting a cigarette, and did not answer. \\n \\n\"Some of the niggers do amazing things that way,\" McMurtrey interposed \\ntactfully. \\n \\nAs with the others, this conduct of their visitor jarred on the manager. From the \\nmoment of Peter Gee\\'s arrival that afternoon Deacon had manifested a tendency \\nto pick on him. He had disputed his statements and been generally rude. \\n \\n\"Maybe it\\'s because Peter\\'s got Chink blood in him,\" had been Andrews\\' \\nhypothesis. \"Deacon\\'s Australian, you know, and they\\'re daffy down there on \\ncolour.\" \\n \\n\"I fancy that\\'s it,\" McMurtrey had agreed. \"But we can\\'t permit any bullying, \\nespecially of a man like Peter Gee, who\\'s whiter than most white men.\" \\n \\nIn this the manager had been in nowise wrong. Peter Gee was that rare creature, \\na good as well as clever Eurasian. In fact, it was the stolid integrity of the Chinese \\nblood that toned the recklessness and licentiousness of the English blood which \\nhad run in his father\\'s veins. Also, he was better educated than any man there, \\nspoke better English as well as several other tongues, and knew and lived more of \\ntheir own ideals of gentlemanness than they did themselves. And, finally, he was \\na gentle soul. Violence he deprecated, though he had killed men in his time. \\nTurbulence he abhorred. \\n \\nHe always avoided it as he would the plague. \\n \\nCaptain Stapler stepped in to help McMurtrey: \\n \\n\"I remember, when I changed schooners and came into Altman, the niggers knew \\nright off the bat it was me. I wasn\\'t expected, either, much less to be in another \\ncraft. They told the trader it was me. He used the glasses, and wouldn\\'t believe \\nthem. But they did know. Told me afterward they could see it sticking out all over \\nthe schooner that I was running her.\" \\n \\nDeacon ignored him, and returned to the attack on the pearl-buyer. \\n \\n\"How do you know from the sound of the anchor that it was this whatever-you-\\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n96 \\ncalled-him man?\" he challenged. \\n \\n\"There are so many things that go to make up such a judgment,\" Peter Gee \\nanswered. \"It\\'s very hard to explain. It would require almost a text book.\" \\n \\n\"I thought so,\" Deacon sneered. \"Explanation that doesn\\'t explain is easy.\" \\n \\n\"Who\\'s for bridge?\" Eddy Little, the second clerk, interrupted, looking up \\nexpectantly and starting to shuffle. \"You\\'ll play, won\\'t you, Peter?\" \\n \\n\"If he does, he\\'s a bluffer,\" Deacon cut back. \"I\\'m getting tired of all this \\npoppycock. Mr. Gee, you will favour me and put yourself in a better light if you \\ntell how you know who that man was that just dropped anchor. After that I\\'ll play \\nyou piquet.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'d prefer bridge,\" Peter answered. \"As for the other thing, it\\'s something like this: \\nBy the sound it was a small craft--no square-rigger. No whistle, no siren, was \\nblown--again a small craft. It anchored close in--still again a small craft, for \\nsteamers and big ships must drop hook outside the middle shoal. Now the \\nentrance is tortuous. There is no recruiting nor trading captain in the group who \\ndares to run the passage after dark. Certainly no stranger would. There were two \\nexceptions. The first was Margonville. But he was executed by the High Court at \\nFiji. Remains the other exception, David Grief. Night or day, in any weather, he \\nruns the passage. This is well known to all. A possible factor, in case Grief were \\nsomewhere else, would be some young dare-devil of a skipper. In this connection, \\nin the first place, I don\\'t know of any, nor does anybody else. In the second place, \\nDavid Grief is in these waters, cruising on the Gunga, which is shortly scheduled \\nto leave here for Karo-Karo. I spoke to Grief, on the Gunga, in Sandfly Passage, \\nday before yesterday. He was putting a trader ashore on a new station. He said he \\nwas going to call in at Babo, and then come on to Goboto. He has had ample time \\nto get here. I have heard an anchor drop. Who else than David Grief can it be? \\nCaptain Donovan is skipper of the Gunga, and him I know too well to believe that \\nhe\\'d run in to Goboto after dark unless his owner were in charge. In a few \\nminutes David Grief will enter through that door and say, \\'In Guvutu they merely \\ndrink between drinks.\\' I\\'ll wager fifty pounds he\\'s the man that enters and that \\nhis words will be, \\'In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks. \\'\" Deacon was for \\nthe moment crushed. The sullen blood rose darkly in his face. \\n \\n\"Well, he\\'s answered you,\" McMurtrey laughed genially. \"And I\\'ll back his bet \\nmyself for a couple of sovereigns.\" \\n \\n\"Bridge! Who\\'s going to take a hand?\" Eddy Little cried impatiently. \"Come on, \\nPeter!\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n97 \\n \\n\"The rest of you play,\" Deacon said. \"He and I are going to play piquet.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'d prefer bridge,\" Peter Gee said mildly. \\n \\n\"Don\\'t you play piquet?\" \\n \\nThe pearl-buyer nodded. \\n \\n\"Then come on. Maybe I can show I know more about that than I do about \\nanchors.\" \\n \\n\"Oh, I say----\" McMurtrey began. \\n \\n\"You can play bridge,\" Deacon shut him off. \"We prefer piquet.\" \\n \\nReluctantly, Peter Gee was bullied into a game that he knew would be unhappy. \\n \\n\"Only a rubber,\" he said, as he cut for deal. \\n \\n\"For how much?\" Deacon asked. \\n \\nPeter Gee shrugged his shoulders. \"As you please.\" \\n \\n\"Hundred up--five pounds a game?\" \\n \\nPeter Gee agreed. \\n \\n\"With the lurch double, of course, ten pounds?\" \\n \\n\"All right,\" said Peter Gee. \\n \\nAt another table four of the others sat in at bridge. Captain Stapler, who was no \\ncard-player, looked on and replenished the long glasses of Scotch that stood at \\neach man\\'s right hand. McMurtrey, with poorly concealed apprehension, followed \\nas well as he could what went on at the piquet table. His fellow Englishmen as \\nwell were shocked by the behaviour of the Australian, and all were troubled by \\nfear of some untoward act on his part. That he was working up his animosity \\nagainst the half-caste, and that the explosion might come any time, was apparent \\nto all. \\n \\n\"I hope Peter loses,\" McMurtrey said in an undertone. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n98 \\n\"Not if he has any luck,\" Andrews answered. \"He\\'s a wizard at piquet. I know by \\nexperience.\" \\n \\nThat Peter Gee was lucky was patent from the continual badgering of Deacon, \\nwho filled his glass frequently. He had lost the first game, and, from his remarks, \\nwas losing the second, when the door opened and David Grief entered. \\n \\n\"In Guvutu they merely drink between drinks,\" he remarked casually to the \\nassembled company, ere he gripped the manager\\'s hand. \"Hello, Mac! Say, my \\nskipper\\'s down in the whaleboat. He\\'s got a silk shirt, a tie, and tennis shoes, all \\ncomplete, but he wants you to send a pair of pants down. Mine are too small, but \\nyours will fit him. Hello, Eddy! How\\'s that ngari-ngari? You up, Jock? The miracle \\nhas happened. No one down with fever, and no one remarkably drunk.\" He \\nsighed, \"I suppose the night is young yet. Hello, Peter! Did you catch that big \\nsquall an hour after you left us? We had to let go the second anchor.\" \\n \\nWhile he was being introduced to Deacon, McMurtrey dispatched a house-boy \\nwith the pants, and when Captain Donovan came in it was as a white man \\nshould--at least in Goboto. \\n \\nDeacon lost the second game, and an outburst heralded the fact. Peter Gee \\ndevoted himself to lighting a cigarette and keeping quiet. \\n \\n\"What?--are you quitting because you\\'re ahead?\" Deacon demanded. \\n \\nGrief raised his eyebrows questioningly to McMurtrey, who frowned back his own \\ndisgust. \\n \\n\"It\\'s the rubber,\" Peter Gee answered. \\n \\n\"It takes three games to make a rubber. It\\'s my deal. Come on!\" \\n \\nPeter Gee acquiesced, and the third game was on. \\n \\n\"Young whelp--he needs a lacing,\" McMurtrey muttered to Grief. \"Come on, let us \\nquit, you chaps. I want to keep an eye on him. If he goes too far I\\'ll throw him out \\non the beach, company instructions or no.\" \\n \\n\"Who is he?\" Grief queried. \\n \\n\"A left-over from last steamer. Company\\'s orders to treat him nice. He\\'s looking to \\ninvest in a plantation. Has a ten-thousand-pound letter of credit with the \\ncompany. He\\'s got \\'all-white Australia\\' on the brain. Thinks because his skin is \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n99 \\nwhite and because his father was once Attorney-General of the Commonwealth \\nthat he can be a cur. That\\'s why he\\'s picking on Peter, and you know Peter\\'s the \\nlast man in the world to make trouble or incur trouble. Damn the company. I \\ndidn\\'t engage to wet-nurse its infants with bank accounts. Come on, fill your \\nglass, Grief. The man\\'s a blighter, a blithering blighter.\" \\n \\n\"Maybe he\\'s only young,\" Grief suggested. \\n \\n\"He can\\'t contain his drink--that\\'s clear.\" The manager glared his disgust and \\nwrath. \"If he raises a hand to Peter, so help me, I\\'ll give him a licking myself, the \\nlittle overgrown cad!\" \\n \\nThe pearl-buyer pulled the pegs out of the cribbage board on which he was \\nscoring and sat back. He had won the third game. He glanced across to Eddy \\nLittle, saying: \\n \\n\"I\\'m ready for the bridge, now.\" \\n \\n\"I wouldn\\'t be a quitter,\" Deacon snarled. \\n \\n\"Oh, really, I\\'m tired of the game,\" Peter Gee assured him with his habitual \\nquietness. \\n \\n\"Come on and be game,\" Deacon bullied. \"One more. You can\\'t take my money \\nthat way. I\\'m out fifteen pounds. Double or quits.\" \\n \\nMcMurtrey was about to interpose, but Grief restrained him with his eyes. \\n \\n\"If it positively is the last, all right,\" said Peter Gee, gathering up the cards. \"It\\'s \\nmy deal, I believe. As I understand it, this final is for fifteen pounds. Either you \\nowe me thirty or we quit even?\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s it, chappie. Either we break even or I pay you thirty.\" \\n \\n\"Getting blooded, eh?\" Grief remarked, drawing up a chair. \\n \\nThe other men stood or sat around the table, and Deacon played again in bad \\nluck. That he was a good player was clear. The cards were merely running against \\nhim. That he could not take his ill luck with equanimity was equally clear. He \\nwas guilty of sharp, ugly curses, and he snapped and growled at the \\nimperturbable half-caste. In the end Peter Gee counted out, while Deacon had not \\neven made his fifty points. He glowered speechlessly at his opponent. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n100 \\n\"Looks like a lurch,\" said Grief. \\n \\n\"Which is double,\" said Peter Gee. \\n \\n\"There\\'s no need your telling me,\" Deacon snarled. \"I\\'ve studied arithmetic. I owe \\nyou forty-five pounds. There, take it!\" \\n \\nThe way in which he flung the nine five-pound notes on the table was an insult in \\nitself. Peter Gee was even quieter, and flew no signals of resentment. \\n \\n\"You\\'ve got fool\\'s luck, but you can\\'t play cards, I can tell you that much,\" Deacon \\nwent on. \"I could teach you cards.\" \\n \\nThe half-caste smiled and nodded acquiescence as he folded up the money. \\n \\n\"There\\'s a little game called casino--I wonder if you ever heard of it?--a child\\'s \\ngame.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ve seen it played,\" the half-caste murmured gently. \\n \\n\"What\\'s that?\" snapped Deacon. \"Maybe you think you can play it?\" \\n \\n\"Oh, no, not for a moment. I\\'m afraid I haven\\'t head enough for it.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s a bully game, casino,\" Grief broke in pleasantly. \"I like it very much.\" \\n \\nDeacon ignored him. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll play you ten quid a game--thirty-one points out,\" was the challenge to Peter \\nGee. \"And I\\'ll show you how little you know about cards. Come on! Where\\'s a full \\ndeck?\" \\n \\n\"No, thanks,\" the half-caste answered. \"They are waiting for me in order to make \\nup a bridge set.\" \\n \\n\"Yes, come on,\" Eddy Little begged eagerly. \"Come on, Peter, let\\'s get started.\" \\n \\n\"Afraid of a little game like casino,\" Deacon girded. \"Maybe the stakes are too \\nhigh. I\\'ll play you for pennies--or farthings, if you say so.\" \\n \\nThe man\\'s conduct was a hurt and an affront to all of them. McMurtrey could \\nstand it no longer. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n101 \\n\"Now hold on, Deacon. He says he doesn\\'t want to play. Let him alone.\" \\n \\nDeacon turned raging upon his host; but before he could blurt out his abuse, \\nGrief had stepped into the breach. \\n \\n\"I\\'d like to play casino with you,\" he said. \\n \\n\"What do you know about it?\" \\n \\n\"Not much, but I\\'m willing to learn.\" \\n \\n\"Well, I\\'m not teaching for pennies to-night.\" \\n \\n\"Oh, that\\'s all right,\" Grief answered. \"I\\'ll play for almost any sum--within reason, \\nof course.\" \\n \\nDeacon proceeded to dispose of this intruder with one stroke. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll play you a hundred pounds a game, if that will do you any good.\" \\n \\nGrief beamed his delight. \"That will be all right, very right. Let us begin. Do you \\ncount sweeps?\" \\n \\nDeacon was taken aback. He had not expected a Goboton trader to be anything \\nbut crushed by such a proposition. \\n \\n\"Do you count sweeps?\" Grief repeated. \\n \\nAndrews had brought him a new deck, and he was throwing out the joker. \\n \\n\"Certainly not,\" Deacon answered. \"That\\'s a sissy game.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'m glad,\" Grief coincided. \"I don\\'t like sissy games either.\" \\n \\n\"You don\\'t, eh? Well, then, I\\'ll tell you what we\\'ll do. We\\'ll play for five hundred \\npounds a game.\" \\n \\nAgain Deacon was taken aback. \\n \\n\"I\\'m agreeable,\" Grief said, beginning to shuffle. \"Cards and spades go out first, of \\ncourse, and then big and little casino, and the aces in the bridge order of value. Is \\nthat right?\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n102 \\n\"You\\'re a lot of jokers down here,\" Deacon laughed, but his laughter was strained. \\n\"How do I know you\\'ve got the money?\" \\n \\n\"By the same token I know you\\'ve got it. Mac, how\\'s my credit with the company?\" \\n \\n\"For all you want,\" the manager answered. \\n \\n\"You personally guarantee that?\" Deacon demanded. \\n \\n\"I certainly do,\" McMurtrey said. \"Depend upon it, the company will honour his \\npaper up and past your letter of credit.\" \\n \\n\"Low deals,\" Grief said, placing the deck before Deacon on the table. \\n \\nThe latter hesitated in the midst of the cut and looked around with querulous \\nmisgiving at the faces of the others. The clerks and captains nodded. \\n \\n\"You\\'re all strangers to me,\" Deacon complained. \"How am I to know? Money on \\npaper isn\\'t always the real thing.\" \\n \\nThen it was that Peter Gee, drawing a wallet from his pocket and borrowing a \\nfountain pen from McMurtrey, went into action. \\n \\n\"I haven\\'t gone to buying yet,\" the half-caste explained, \"so the account is intact. \\nI\\'ll just indorse it over to you, Grief. It\\'s for fifteen thousand. There, look at it.\" \\n \\nDeacon intercepted the letter of credit as it was being passed across the table. He \\nread it slowly, then glanced up at McMurtrey. \\n \\n\"Is that right?\" \\n \\n\"Yes. It\\'s just the same as your own, and just as good. The company\\'s paper is \\nalways good.\" \\n \\nDeacon cut the cards, won the deal, and gave them a thorough shuffle. But his \\nluck was still against him, and he lost the game. \\n \\n\"Another game,\" he said. \"We didn\\'t say how many, and you can\\'t quit with me a \\nloser. I want action.\" \\n \\nGrief shuffled and passed the cards for the cut. \\n \\n\"Let\\'s play for a thousand,\" Deacon said, when he had lost the second game. And \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n103 \\nwhen the thousand had gone the way of the two five hundred bets he proposed to \\nplay for two thousand. \\n \\n\"That\\'s progression,\" McMurtrey warned, and was rewarded by a glare from \\nDeacon. But the manager was insistent. \"You don\\'t have to play progression, \\nGrief, unless you\\'re foolish.\" \\n \\n\"Who\\'s playing this game?\" Deacon flamed at his host; and then, to Grief: \"I\\'ve \\nlost two thousand to you. Will you play for two thousand?\" \\n \\nGrief nodded, the fourth game began, and Deacon won. The manifest unfairness \\nof such betting was known to all of them. Though he had lost three games out of \\nfour, Deacon had lost no money. By the child\\'s device of doubling his wager with \\neach loss, he was bound, with the first game he won, no matter how long delayed, \\nto be even again. \\n \\nHe now evinced an unspoken desire to stop, but Grief passed the deck to be cut. \\n \\n\"What?\" Deacon cried. \"You want more?\" \\n \\n\"Haven\\'t got anything yet,\" Grief murmured whimsically, as he began the deal. \\n\"For the usual five hundred, I suppose?\" \\n \\nThe shame of what he had done must have tingled in Deacon, for he answered, \\n\"No, we\\'ll play for a thousand. And say! Thirty-one points is too long. Why not \\ntwenty-one points out--if it isn\\'t too rapid for you?\" \\n \\n\"That will make it a nice, quick, little game,\" Grief agreed. \\n \\nThe former method of play was repeated. Deacon lost two games, doubled the \\nstake, and was again even. But Grief was patient, though the thing occurred \\nseveral times in the next hour\\'s play. Then happened what he was waiting for--a \\nlengthening in the series of losing games for Deacon. The latter doubled to four \\nthousand and lost, doubled to eight thousand and lost, and then proposed to \\ndouble to sixteen thousand. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"You can\\'t do that, you know. You\\'re only ten thousand \\ncredit with the company.\" \\n \\n\"You mean you won\\'t give me action?\" Deacon asked hoarsely. \"You mean that \\nwith eight thousand of my money you\\'re going to quit?\" \\n \\nGrief smiled and shook his head. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n104 \\n \\n\"It\\'s robbery, plain robbery,\" Deacon went on. \"You take my money and won\\'t give \\nme action.\" \\n \\n\"No, you\\'re wrong. I\\'m perfectly willing to give you what action you\\'ve got coming \\nto you. You\\'ve got two thousand pounds of action yet.\" \\n \\n\"Well, we\\'ll play it,\" Deacon took him up. \"You cut.\" \\n \\nThe game was played in silence, save for irritable remarks and curses from \\nDeacon. Silently the onlookers filled and sipped their long Scotch glasses. Grief \\ntook no notice of his opponent\\'s outbursts, but concentrated on the game. He was \\nreally playing cards, and there were fifty-two in the deck to be kept track of, and \\nof which he did keep track. Two thirds of the way through the last deal he threw \\ndown his hand. \\n \\n\"Cards put me out,\" he said. \"I have twenty-seven.\" \\n \\n\"If you\\'ve made a mistake,\" Deacon threatened, his face white and drawn. \\n \\n\"Then I shall have lost. Count them.\" \\n \\nGrief passed over his stack of takings, and Deacon, with trembling fingers, \\nverified the count. He half shoved his chair back from the table and emptied his \\nglass. He looked about him at unsympathetic faces. \\n \\n\"I fancy I\\'ll be catching the next steamer for Sydney,\" he said, and for the first \\ntime his speech was quiet and without bluster. \\n \\nAs Grief told them afterward: \"Had he whined or raised a roar I wouldn\\'t have \\ngiven him that last chance. As it was, he took his medicine like a man, and I had \\nto do it.\" \\n \\nDeacon glanced at his watch, simulated a weary yawn, and started to rise. \\n \\n\"Wait,\" Grief said. \"Do you want further action?\" \\n \\nThe other sank down in his chair, strove to speak, but could not, licked his dry \\nlips, and nodded his head. \\n \\n\"Captain Donovan here sails at daylight in the Gunga for Karo-Karo,\" Grief began \\nwith seeming irrelevance. \"Karo-Karo is a ring of sand in the sea, with a few \\nthousand cocoa-nut trees. Pandanus grows there, but they can\\'t grow sweet \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n105 \\npotatoes nor taro. There aremabout eight hundred natives, a king and two prime \\nministers, and the last three named are the only ones who wear any clothes. It\\'s a \\nsort of God-forsaken little hole, and once a year I send a schooner up from \\nGoboto. The drinking water is brackish, but old Tom Butler has survived on it for \\na dozen years. He\\'s the only white man there, and he has a boat\\'s crew of five \\nSanta Cruz boys who would run away or kill him if they could. That is why they \\nwere sent there. They can\\'t run away. He is always supplied with the hard cases \\nfrom the plantations. There are no missionaries. Two native Samoan teachers \\nwere clubbed to death on the beach when they landed several years ago. \\n \\n\"Naturally, you are wondering what it is all about. But have patience. As I have \\nsaid, Captain Donovan sails on the annual trip to Karo-Karo at daylight to-\\nmorrow. Tom Butler is old, and getting quite helpless. I\\'ve tried to retire him to \\nAustralia, but he says he wants to remain and die on Karo-Karo, and he will in \\nthe next year or so. He\\'s a queer old codger. Now the time is due for me to send \\nsome white man up to take the work off his hands. I wonder how you\\'d like the \\njob. You\\'d have to stay two years. \\n \\n\"Hold on! I\\'ve not finished. You\\'ve talked frequently of action this evening. There\\'s \\nno action in betting away what you\\'ve never sweated for. The money you\\'ve lost to \\nme was left you by your father or some other relative who did the sweating. But \\ntwo years of work as trader on Karo-Karo would mean something. I\\'ll bet the ten \\nthousand I\\'ve won from you against two years of your time. If you win, the \\nmoney\\'s yours. If you lose, you take the job at Karo-Karo and sail at daylight. \\nNow that\\'s what might be called real action. Will you play?\" \\n \\nDeacon could not speak. His throat lumped and he nodded his head as he \\nreached for the cards. \\n \\n\"One thing more,\" Grief said. \"I can do even better. If you lose, two years of your \\ntime are mine--naturally without wages. Nevertheless, I\\'ll pay you wages. If your \\nwork is satisfactory, if you observe all instructions and rules, I\\'ll pay you five \\nthousand pounds a year for two years. The money will be deposited with the \\ncompany, to be paid to you, with interest, when the time expires. Is that all \\nright?\" \\n \\n\"Too much so,\" Deacon stammered. \"You are unfair to yourself. A trader only gets \\nten or fifteen pounds a month.\" \\n \\n\"Put it down to action, then,\" Grief said, with an air of dismissal. \"And before we \\nbegin, I\\'ll jot down several of the rules. These you will repeat aloud every morning \\nduring the two years--if you lose. They are for the good of your soul. When you \\nhave repeated them aloud seven hundred and thirty Karo-Karo mornings I am \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n106 \\nconfident they will be in your memory to stay. Lend me your pen, Mac. Now, let\\'s \\nsee----\" \\n \\nHe wrote steadily and rapidly for some minutes, then proceeded to read the \\nmatter aloud: \\n \\n\"I must always remember that one man is as good as another, save and except \\nwhen he thinks he is better. \\n \\n\"No matter how drunk I am I must not fail to be a gentleman. A gentleman is a \\nman who is gentle. Note: It would be better not to get drunk. \\n \\n\"When I play a man\\'s game with men, I must play like a man. \\n \\n\"A good curse, rightly used and rarely, is an efficient thing. Too many curses spoil \\nthe cursing. Note: A curse cannot change a card seguence nor cause the wind to \\nblow. \\n \\n\"There is no license for a man to be less than a man. Ten thousand pounds \\ncannot purchase such a license.\" \\n \\nAt the beginning of the reading Deacon\\'s face had gone white with anger. Then \\nhad arisen, from neck to forehead, a slow and terrible flush that deepened to the \\nend of the reading. \\n \\n\"There, that will be all,\" Grief said, as he folded the paper and tossed it to the \\ncentre of the table. \"Are you still ready to play the game?\" \\n \\n\"I deserve it,\" Deacon muttered brokenly. \"I\\'ve been an ass. Mr. Gee, before I \\nknow whether I win or lose, I want to apologize. Maybe it was the whiskey, I don\\'t \\nknow, but I\\'m an ass, a cad, a bounder--everything that\\'s rotten.\" \\n \\nHe held out his hand, and the half-caste took it beamingly. \\n \\n\"I say, Grief,\" he blurted out, \"the boy\\'s all right. Call the whole thing off, and let\\'s \\nforget it in a final nightcap.\" \\n \\nGrief showed signs of debating, but Deacon cried: \\n \\n\"No; I won\\'t permit it. I\\'m not a quitter. If it\\'s Karo-Karo, it\\'s Karo-Karo. There\\'s \\nnothing more to it.\" \\n \\n\"Right,\" said Grief, as he began the shuffle. \"If he\\'s the right stuff to go to Karo-\\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n107 \\nKaro, Karo-Karo won\\'t do him any harm.\" \\n \\nThe game was close and hard. Three times they divided the deck between them \\nand \"cards\" was not scored. At the beginning of the fifth and last deal, Deacon \\nneeded three points to go out, and Grief needed four. \"Cards\" alone would put \\nDeacon out, and he played for \"cards\". He no longer muttered or cursed, and \\nplayed his best game of the evening. Incidentally he gathered in the two black \\naces and the ace of hearts. \\n \\n\"I suppose you can name the four cards I hold,\" he challenged, as the last of the \\ndeal was exhausted and he picked up his hand. \\n \\nGrief nodded. \\n \\n\"Then name them.\" \\n \\n\"The knave of spades, the deuce of spades, the tray of hearts, and the ace of \\ndiamonds,\" Grief answered. \\n \\nThose behind Deacon and looking at his hand made no sign. Yet the naming had \\nbeen correct. \\n \\n\"I fancy you play casino better than I,\" Deacon acknowledged. \"I can name only \\nthree of yours, a knave, an ace, and big casino.\" \\n \\n\"Wrong. There aren\\'t five aces in the deck. You\\'ve taken in three and you hold the \\nfourth in your hand now.\" \\n \\n\"By Jove, you\\'re right,\" Deacon admitted. \"I did scoop in three. Anyway, I\\'ll make \\n\\'cards\\' on you. That\\'s all I need.\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ll let you save little casino----\" Grief paused to calculate. \"Yes, and the ace as \\nwell, and still I\\'ll make \\'cards\\' and go out with big casino. Play.\" \\n \\n\"No \\'cards\\' and I win!\" Deacon exulted as the last of the hand was played. \"I go \\nout on little casino and the four aces. \\'Big casino\\' and \\'spades\\' only bring you to \\ntwenty.\" \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"Some mistake, I\\'m afraid.\" \\n \\n\"No,\" Deacon declared positively. \"I counted every card I took in. That\\'s the one \\nthing I was correct on. I\\'ve twenty-six, and you\\'ve twenty-six.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n108 \\n\"Count again,\" Grief said. \\n \\nCarefully and slowly, with trembling fingers, Deacon counted the cards he had \\ntaken. There were twenty-five. He reached over to the corner of the table, took up \\nthe rules Grief had written, folded them, and put them in his pocket. Then he \\nemptied his glass, and stood up. Captain Donovan looked at his watch, yawned, \\nand also arose. \\n \\n\"Going aboard, Captain?\" Deacon asked. \\n \\n\"Yes,\" was the answer. \"What time shall I send the whaleboat for you?\" \\n \\n\"I\\'ll go with you now. We\\'ll pick up my luggage from the Billy as we go by, I was \\nsailing on her for Babo in the morning.\" \\n \\nDeacon shook hands all around, after receiving a final pledge of good luck on \\nKaro-Karo. \\n \\n\"Does Tom Butler play cards?\" he asked Grief. \\n \\n\"Solitaire,\" was the answer. \\n \\n\"Then I\\'ll teach him double solitaire.\" Deacon turned toward the door, where \\nCaptain Donovan waited, and added with a sigh, \"And I fancy he\\'ll skin me, too, if \\nhe plays like the rest of you island men.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n109 \\n \\nChapter Seven--THE FEATHERS OF THE SUN \\n \\n I \\n \\nIt was the island of Fitu-Iva--the last independent Polynesian stronghold in the \\nSouth Seas. Three factors conduced to Fitu-Iva\\'s independence. The first and \\nsecond were its isolation and the warlikeness of its population. But these would \\nnot have saved it in the end had it not been for the fact that Japan, France, Great \\nBritain, Germany, and the United States discovered its desirableness \\nsimultaneously. It was like gamins scrambling for a penny. They got in one \\nanother\\'s way. The war vessels of the five Powers cluttered Fitu-Iva\\'s one small \\nharbour. There were rumours of war and threats of war. Over its morning toast \\nall the world read columns about Fitu-Iva. As a Yankee blue jacket epitomized it \\nat the time, they all got their feet in the trough at once. \\n \\nSo it was that Fitu-Iva escaped even a joint protectorate, and King Tulifau, \\notherwise Tui Tulifau, continued to dispense the high justice and the low in the \\nframe-house palace built for him by a Sydney trader out of California redwood. \\nNot only was Tui Tulifau every inch a king, but he was every second a king. When \\nhe had ruled fifty-eight years and five months, he was only fifty-eight years and \\nthree months old. That is to say, he had ruled over five million seconds more than \\nhe had breathed, having been crowned two months before he was born. \\n \\nHe was a kingly king, a royal figure of a man, standing six feet and a half, and, \\nwithout being excessively fat, weighing three hundred and twenty pounds. But \\nthis was not unusual for Polynesian \"chief stock.\" Sepeli, his queen, was six feet \\nthree inches and weighed two hundred and sixty, while her brother, Uiliami, who \\ncommanded the army in the intervals of resignation from the premiership, topped \\nher by an inch and notched her an even half-hundredweight. Tui Tulifau was a \\nmerry soul, a great feaster and drinker. So were all his people merry souls, save \\nin anger, when, on occasion, they could be guilty even of throwing dead pigs at \\nthose who made them wroth. Nevertheless, on occasion, they could fight like \\nMaoris, as piratical sandalwood traders and Blackbirders in the old days learned \\nto their cost. \\n \\nII \\n \\nGrief\\'s schooner, the Cantani, had passed the Pillar Rocks at the entrance two \\nhours before and crept up the harbour to the whispering flutters of a breeze that \\ncould not make up its mind to blow. It was a cool, starlight evening, and they \\nlolled about the poop waiting till their snail\\'s pace would bring them to the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n110 \\nanchorage. Willie Smee, the supercargo, emerged from the cabin, conspicuous in \\nhis shore clothes. The mate glanced at his shirt, of the finest and whitest silk, \\nand giggled significantly. \\n \\n\"Dance, to-night, I suppose?\" Grief observed. \\n \\n\"No,\" said the mate. \"It\\'s Taitua. Willie\\'s stuck on her.\" \\n \\n\"Catch me,\" the supercargo disclaimed. \\n \\n\"Then she\\'s stuck on you, and it\\'s all the same,\" the mate went on. \"You won\\'t be \\nashore half an hour before you\\'ll have a flower behind your ear, a wreath on your \\nhead, and your arm around Taitua.\" \\n \\n\"Simple jealousy,\" Willie Smee sniffed. \"You\\'d like to have her yourself, only you \\ncan\\'t.\" \\n \\n\"I can\\'t find shirts like that, that\\'s why. I\\'ll bet you half a crown you won\\'t sail \\nfrom Fitu-Iva with that shirt.\" \\n \\n\"And if Taitua doesn\\'t get it, it\\'s an even break Tui Tulifau does,\" Grief warned. \\n\"Better not let him spot that shirt, or it\\'s all day with it.\" \\n \\n\"That\\'s right,\" Captain Boig agreed, turning his head from watching the house \\nlights on the shore. \"Last voyage he fined one of my Kanakas out of a fancy belt \\nand sheath-knife.\" He turned to the mate. \"You can let go any time, Mr. Marsh. \\nDon\\'t give too much slack. There\\'s no sign of wind, and in the morning we may \\nshift opposite the copra-sheds.\" \\n \\nA minute later the anchor rumbled down. The whaleboat, already hoisted out, lay \\nalongside, and the shore-going party dropped into it. Save for the Kanakas, who \\nwere all bent for shore, only Grief and the supercargo were in the boat. At the \\nhead of the little coral-stone pier Willie Smee, with an apologetic gurgle, separated \\nfrom his employer and disappeared down an avenue of palms. Grief turned in the \\nopposite direction past the front of the old mission church. Here, among the \\ngraves on the beach, lightly clad in ahu\\'s and lava-lavas, flower-crowned and \\ngarlanded, with great phosphorescent hibiscus blossoms in their hair, youths and \\nmaidens were dancing. Farther on, Grief passed the long, grass-built himine \\nhouse, where a few score of the elders sat in long rows chanting the old hymns \\ntaught them by forgotten missionaries. He passed also the palace of Tui Tulifau, \\nwhere, by the lights and sounds, he knew the customary revelry was going on. \\nFor of the happy South Sea isles, Fitu-Iva was the happiest. They feasted and \\nfrolicked at births and deaths, and the dead and the unborn were likewise \\n', \"www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n111 \\nfeasted. \\n \\nGrief held steadily along the Broom Road, which curved and twisted through a \\nlush growth of flowers and fern-like algarobas. The warm air was rich with \\nperfume, and overhead, outlined against the stars, were fruit-burdened mangoes, \\nstately avocado trees, and slender-tufted palms. Every here and there were grass \\nhouses. Voices and laughter rippled through the darkness. Out on the water \\nflickering lights and soft-voiced choruses marked the fishers returning from the \\nreef. \\n \\nAt last Grief stepped aside from the road, stumbling over a pig that grunted \\nindignantly. Looking through an open door, he saw a stout and elderly native \\nsitting on a heap of mats a dozen deep. From time to time, automatically, he \\nbrushed his naked legs with a cocoa-nut-fibre fly-flicker. He wore glasses, and \\nwas reading methodically in what Grief knew to be an English Bible. For this was \\nIeremia, his trader, so named from the prophet Jeremiah. \\n \\nIeremia was lighter-skinned than the Fitu-Ivans, as was natural in a full-blooded \\nSamoan. Educated by the missionaries, as lay teacher he had served their cause \\nwell over in the cannibal atolls to the westward. As a reward, he had been sent to \\nthe paradise of Fitu-Iva, where all were or had been good converts, to gather in \\nthe backsliders. Unfortunately, Ieremia had become too well educated. A stray \\nvolume of Darwin, a nagging wife, and a pretty Fitu-Ivan widow had driven him \\ninto the ranks of the backsliders. It was not a case of apostasy. The effect of \\nDarwin had been one of intellectual fatigue. What was the use of trying to \\nunderstand this vastly complicated and enigmatical world, especially when one \\nwas married to a nagging woman? As Ieremia slackened in his labours, the \\nmission board threatened louder and louder to send him back to the atolls, while \\nhis wife's tongue grew correspondingly sharper. Tui Tulifau was a sympathetic \\nmonarch, whose queen, on occasions when he was particularly drunk, was \\nknown to beat him. For political reasons--the queen belonging to as royal stock \\nas himself and her brother commanding the army--Tui Tulifau could not divorce \\nher, but he could and did divorce Ieremia, who promptly took up with commercial \\nlife and the lady of his choice. As an independent trader he had failed, chiefly \\nbecause of the disastrous patronage of Tui Tulifau. To refuse credit to that merry \\nmonarch was to invite confiscation; to grant him credit was certain bankruptcy. \\nAfter a year's idleness on the beach, leremia had become David Grief's trader, and \\nfor a dozen years his service had been honourable and efficient, for Grief had \\nproven the first man who successfully refused credit to the king or who collected \\nwhen it had been accorded. \\n \\nIeremia looked gravely over the rims of his glasses when his employer entered, \\ngravely marked the place in the Bible and set it aside, and gravely shook hands. \\n\", 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n112 \\n \\n\"I am glad you came in person,\" he said. \\n \\n\"How else could I come?\" Grief laughed. \\n \\nBut Ieremia had no sense of humour, and he ignored the remark. \\n \\n\"The commercial situation on the island is damn bad,\" he said with great \\nsolemnity and an unctuous mouthing of the many-syllabled words. \"My ledger \\naccount is shocking.\" \\n \\n\"Trade bad?\" \\n \\n\"On the contrary. It has been excellent. The shelves are empty, exceedingly \\nempty. But----\" His eyes glistened proudly. \"But there are many goods remaining \\nin the storehouse; I have kept it carefully locked.\" \\n \\n\"Been allowing Tui Tulifau too much credit?\" \\n \\n\"On the contrary. There has been no credit at all. And every old account has been \\nsettled up.\" \\n \\n\"I don\\'t follow you, Ieremia,\" Grief confessed. \"What\\'s the joke?--shelves empty, no \\ncredit, old accounts all square, storehouse carefully locked--what\\'s the answer?\" \\n \\nIeremia did not reply immediately. Reaching under the rear corner of the mats, he \\ndrew forth a large cash-box. Grief noted and wondered that it was not locked. The \\nSamoan had always been fastidiously cautious in guarding cash. The box seemed \\nfilled with paper money. He skinned off the top note and passed it over. \\n \\n\"There is the answer.\" \\n \\nGrief glanced at a fairly well executed banknote. \"The First Royal Bank of Fitu-Iva \\nwill pay to bearer on demand one pound sterling,\" he read. In the centre was the \\nsmudged likeness of a native face. At the bottom was the signature of Tui Tulifau, \\nand the signature of Fulualea, with the printed information appended, \\n\"Chancellor of the Exchequer.\" \\n \\n\"Who the deuce is Fulualea?\" Grief demanded. \"It\\'s Fijian, isn\\'t it?--meaning the \\nfeathers of the sun?\" \\n \\n\"Just so. It means the feathers of the sun. Thus does this base interloper caption \\nhimself. He has come up from Fiji to turn Fitu-Iva upside down--that is, \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n113 \\ncommercially.\" \\n \\n\"Some one of those smart Levuka boys, I suppose?\" \\n \\nIeremia shook his head sadly. \"No, this low fellow is a white man and a \\nscoundrel. He has taken a noble and high-sounding Fijian name and dragged it \\nin the dirt to suit his nefarious purposes. He has made Tui Tulifau drunk. He has \\nmade him very drunk. He has kept him very drunk all the time. In return, he has \\nbeen made Chancellor of the Exchequer and other things. He has issued this \\nfalse paper and compelled the people to receive it. He has levied a store tax, a \\ncopra tax, and a tobacco tax. There are harbour dues and regulations, and other \\ntaxes. But the people are not taxed--only the traders. When the copra tax was \\nlevied, I lowered the purchasing price accordingly. Then the people began to \\ngrumble, and Feathers of the Sun passed a new law, setting the old price back \\nand forbidding any man to lower it. Me he fined two pounds and five pigs, it being \\nwell known that I possessed five pigs. You will find them entered in the ledger. \\nHawkins, who is trader for the Fulcrum Company, was fined first pigs, then gin, \\nand, because he continued to make loud conversation, the army came and \\nburned his store. When I declined to sell, this Feathers of the Sun fined me once \\nmore and promised to burn the store if again I offended. So I sold all that was on \\nthe shelves, and there is the box full of worthless paper. I shall be chagrined if \\nyou pay me my salary in paper, but it would be just, no more than just. Now, \\nwhat is to be done?\" \\n \\nGrief shrugged his shoulders. \"I must first see this Feathers of the Sun and size \\nup the situation.\" \\n \\n\"Then you must see him soon,\" Ieremia advised. \"Else he will have an \\naccumulation of many fines against you. Thus does he absorb all the coin of the \\nrealm. He has it all now, save what has been buried in the ground.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nOn his way back along the Broom Road, under the lighted lamps that marked the \\nentrance to the palace grounds, Grief encountered a short, rotund gentleman, in \\nunstarched ducks, smooth-shaven and of florid complexion, who was just \\nemerging. Something about his tentative, saturated gait was familiar. Grief knew \\nit on the instant. On the beaches of a dozen South Sea ports had he seen it \\nbefore. \\n \\n\"Of all men, Cornelius Deasy!\" he cried. \\n \\n\"If it ain\\'t Grief himself, the old devil,\" was the return greeting, as they shook \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n114 \\nhands. \\n \\n\"If you\\'ll come on board I\\'ve some choice smoky Irish,\" Grief invited. \\n \\nCornelius threw back his shoulders and stiffened. \\n \\n\"Nothing doin\\', Mr. Grief. \\'Tis Fulualea I am now. No blarneyin\\' of old times for \\nme. Also, and by the leave of his gracious Majesty King Tulifau, \\'tis Chancellor of \\nthe Exchequer I am, an\\' Chief Justice I am, save in moments of royal sport when \\nthe king himself chooses to toy with the wheels of justice.\" \\n \\nGrief whistled his amazement. \"So you\\'re Feathers of the Sun!\" \\n \\n\"I prefer the native idiom,\" was the correction. \"Fulualea, an\\' it please you. Not \\nforgettin\\' old times, Mr. Grief, it sorrows the heart of me to break you the news. \\nYou\\'ll have to pay your legitimate import duties same as any other trader with \\nmind intent on robbin\\' the gentle Polynesian savage on coral isles implanted. ----\\nWhere was I? Ah! I remember. You\\'ve violated the regulations. With malice intent \\nhave you entered the port of Fitu-Iva after sunset without sidelights burnin\\'. \\nDon\\'t interrupt. With my own eyes did I see you. For which offence are you fined \\nthe sum of five pounds. Have you any gin? \\'Tis a serious offence. Not lightly are \\nthe lives of the mariners of our commodious port to be risked for the savin\\' of a \\npenny\\'orth of oil. Did I ask: have you any gin? Tis the harbour master that asks.\" \\n \\n\"You\\'ve taken a lot on your shoulders,\" Grief grinned. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis the white man\\'s burden.

Much as I dislike the doin\\' of \\nit, as harbour master \\'tis my duty to find you guilty of breach of quarantine.\" \\n \\n\"Quarantine?\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis the rulin\\' of the port doctor.

Your offence is serious. Consider yourself fined five cases of \\nfirst-quality Holland gin.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n115 \\n \\nGrief laughed heartily. \"We\\'ll compromise, Cornelius. Come aboard and have a \\ndrink.\" \\n \\nThe Feathers of the Sun waved the proffer aside grandly. \"\\'Tis bribery. I\\'ll have \\nnone of it--me faithful to my salt. And wherefore did you not present your ship\\'s \\npapers? As chief of the custom house you are fined five pounds and two more \\ncases of gin.\" \\n \\n\"Look here, Cornelius. A joke\\'s a joke, but this one has gone far enough. This is \\nnot Levuka. I\\'ve half a mind to pull your nose for you. You can\\'t buck me.\" \\n \\nThe Feathers of the Sun retreated unsteadily and in alarm. \\n \\n\"Lay no violence on me,\" he threatened. \"You\\'re right. This is not Levuka. And by \\nthe same token, with Tui Tulifau and the royal army behind me, buck you is just \\nthe thing I can and will. You\\'ll pay them fines promptly, or I\\'ll confiscate your \\nvessel. You\\'re not the first. What does that Chink pearl-buyer, Peter Gee, do but \\nslip into harbour, violatin\\' all regulations an\\' makin\\' rough house for the matter \\nof a few paltry fines. No; he wouldn\\'t pay \\'em, and he\\'s on the beach now thinkin\\' \\nit over.\" \\n \\n\"You don\\'t mean to say----\" \\n \\n\"Sure an\\' I do. In the high exercise of office I seized his schooner. A fifth of the \\nloyal army is now in charge on board of her. She\\'ll be sold this day week.

How much gin did you say you had?\" \\n \\n\"Still more gin, eh?\" \\n \\n\"An\\' why not? \\'Tis a royal souse is Tui Tulifau.

Are you \\ngoin\\' to pay them fines, Mr. Grief, or is it to harsher measures I\\'ll be forced?\" \\n \\nGrief turned impatiently on his heel. \\n \\n\"Cornelius, you\\'re drunk. Think it over and come to your senses. The old \\nrollicking South Sea days are gone. You can\\'t play tricks like that now.\" \\n \\n\"If you think you\\'re goin\\' on board, Mr. Grief, I\\'ll save you the trouble. I know \\nyour kind, I foresaw your stiff-necked stubbornness. An\\' it\\'s forestalled you are. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n116 \\n\\'Tis on the beach you\\'ll find your crew. The vessel\\'s seized.\" \\n \\nGrief turned back on him in the half-belief still that he was joking. Fulualea again \\nretreated in alarm. The form of a large man loomed beside him in the darkness. \\n \\n\"Is it you, Uiliami?\" Fulualea crooned. \"Here is another sea pirate. Stand by me \\nwith the strength of thy arm, O Herculean brother.\" \\n \\n\"Greeting, Uiliami,\" Grief said. \"Since when has Fitu-Iva come to be run by a \\nLevuka beachcomber? He says my schooner has been seized. Is it true?\" \\n \\n\"It is true,\" Uiliami boomed from his deep chest. \"Have you any more silk shirts \\nlike Willie Smee\\'s? Tui Tulifau would like such a shirt. He has heard of it.\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis all the same,\" Fulualea interrupted. \"Shirts or schooners, the king shall have \\nthem.\" \\n \\n\"Rather high-handed, Cornelius,\" Grief murmured. \"It\\'s rank piracy. You seized \\nmy vessel without giving me a chance.\" \\n \\n\"A chance is it? As we stood here, not five minutes gone, didn\\'t you refuse to pay \\nyour fines?\" \\n \\n\"But she was already seized.\" \\n \\n\"Sure, an\\' why not? Didn\\'t I know you\\'d refuse? \\'Tis all fair, an\\' no injustice done-\\n-Justice, the bright, particular star at whose shining altar Cornelius Deasy--or \\nFulualea, \\'tis the same thing--ever worships. Get thee gone, Mr. Trader, or I\\'ll set \\nthe palace guards on you. Uiliami, \\'tis a desperate character, this trader man. \\nCall the guards.\" \\n \\nUiliami blew the whistle suspended on his broad bare chest by a cord of cocoanut \\nsennit. Grief reached out an angry hand for Cornelius, who titubated into safety \\nbehind Uiliami\\'s massive bulk. A dozen strapping Polynesians, not one under six \\nfeet, ran down the palace walk and ranged behind their commander. \\n \\n\"Get thee gone, Mr. Trader,\" Cornelius ordered. \"The interview is terminated. We\\'ll \\ntry your several cases in the mornin\\'. Appear promptly at the palace at ten o\\'clock \\nto answer to the followin\\' charges, to wit: breach of the peace; seditious and \\ntreasonable utterance; violent assault on the chief magistrate with intent to cut, \\nwound, maim, an\\' bruise; breach of quarantine; violation of harbour regulations; \\nand gross breakage of custom house rules. In the mornin\\', fellow, in the mornin\\', \\njustice shall be done while the breadfruit falls. And the Lord have mercy on your \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n117 \\nsoul.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nBefore the hour set for the trial Grief, accompanied by Peter Gee, won access to \\nTui Tulifau. The king, surrounded by half a dozen chiefs, lay on mats under the \\nshade of the avocados in the palace compound. Early as was the hour, palace \\nmaids were industriously serving squarefaces of gin. The king was glad to see his \\nold friend Davida, and regretful that he had run foul of the new regulations. \\nBeyond that he steadfastly avoided discussion of the matter in hand. All protests \\nof the expropriated traders were washed away in proffers of gin. \"Have a drink,\" \\nwas his invariable reply, though once he unbosomed himself enough to say that \\nFeathers of the Sun was a wonderful man. Never had palace affairs been so \\nprosperous. Never had there been so much money in the treasury, nor so much \\ngin in circulation. \"Well pleased am I with Fulualea,\" he concluded. \"Have a \\ndrink.\" \\n \\n\"We\\'ve got to get out of this pronto,\" Grief whispered to Peter Gee a few minutes \\nlater, \"or we\\'ll be a pair of boiled owls. Also, I am to be tried for arson, or heresy, \\nor leprosy, or something, in a few minutes, and I must control my wits.\" \\n \\nAs they withdrew from the royal presence, Grief caught a glimpse of Sepeli, the \\nqueen. She was peering out at her royal spouse and his fellow tipplers, and the \\nfrown on her face gave Grief his cue. Whatever was to be accomplished must be \\nthrough her. \\n \\nIn another shady corner of the big compound Cornelius was holding court. He \\nhad been at it early, for when Grief arrived the case of Willie Smee was being \\nsettled. The entire royal army, save that portion in charge of the seized vessels, \\nwas in attendance. \\n \\n\"Let the defendant stand up,\" said Cornelius, \"and receive the just and merciful \\nsentence of the Court for licentious and disgraceful conduct unbecomin\\' a \\nsupercargo. The defendant says he has no money. Very well. The Court regrets it \\nhas no calaboose. In lieu thereof, and in view of the impoverished condition of the \\ndefendant, the Court fines said defendant one white silk shirt of the same kind, \\nmake and quality at present worn by defendant.\" \\n \\nCornelius nodded to several of the soldiers, who led the supercargo away behind \\nan avocado tree. A minute later he emerged, minus the garment in question, and \\nsat down beside Grief. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n118 \\n\"What have you been up to?\" Grief asked. \\n \\n\"Blessed if I know. What crimes have you committed?\" \\n \\n\"Next case,\" said Cornelius in his most extra-legal tones. \"David Grief, defendant, \\nstand up. The Court has considered the evidence in the case, or cases, and \\nrenders the following judgment, to wit:--Shut up!\" he thundered at Grief, who had \\nattempted to interrupt. \"I tell you the evidence has been considered, deeply \\nconsidered. It is no wish of the Court to lay additional hardship on the defendant, \\nand the Court takes this opportunity to warn the defendant that he is liable for \\ncontempt. For open and wanton violation of harbour rules and regulations, \\nbreach of quarantine, and disregard of shipping laws, his schooner, the Cantani, \\nis hereby declared confiscated to the Government of Fitu-Iva, to be sold at public \\nauction, ten days from date, with all appurtenances, fittings, and cargo thereunto \\npertaining. For the personal crimes of the defendant, consisting of violent and \\nturbulent conduct and notorious disregard of the laws of the realm, he is fined in \\nthe sum of one hundred pounds sterling and fifteen cases of gin. I will not ask \\nyou if you have anything to say. But will you pay? That is the question.\" \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \\n \\n\"In the meantime,\" Cornelius went on, \"consider yourself a prisoner at large. \\nThere is no calaboose in which to confine you. And finally, it has come to the \\nknowledge of the Court, that at an early hour of this morning, the defendant did \\nwilfully and deliberately send Kanakas in his employ out on the reef to catch fish \\nfor breakfast. This is distinctly an infringement of the rights of the fisherfolk of \\nFitu-Iva. Home industries must be protected. This conduct of the defendant is \\nseverely reprehended by the Court, and on any repetition of the offence the \\noffender and offenders, all and sundry, shall be immediately put to hard labour \\non the improvement of the Broom Road. The court is dismissed.\" \\n \\nAs they left the compound, Peter Gee nudged Grief to look where Tui Tulifau \\nreclined on the mats. The supercargo\\'s shirt, stretched and bulged, already \\nencased the royal fat. \\n \\nIV \\n \\n\"The thing is clear,\" said Peter Gee, at a conference in Ieremia\\'s house. \"Deasy \\nhas about gathered in all the coin. In the meantime he keeps the king going on \\nthe gin he\\'s captured, on our vessels. As soon as he can maneuver it he\\'ll take the \\ncash and skin out on your craft or mine.\" \\n \\n\"He is a low fellow,\" Ieremia declared, pausing in the polishing of his spectacles. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n119 \\n\"He is a scoundrel and a blackguard. He should be struck by a dead pig, by a \\nparticularly dead pig.\" \\n \\n\"The very thing,\" said Grief. \"He shall be struck by a dead pig. Ieremia, I should \\nnot be surprised if you were the man to strike him with the dead pig. Be sure and \\nselect a particularly dead one. Tui Tulifau is down at the boat house broaching a \\ncase of my Scotch. I\\'m going up to the palace to work kitchen politics with the \\nqueen. In the meantime you get a few things on your shelves from the store-room. \\nI\\'ll lend you some, Hawkins. And you, Peter, see the German store. Start in all of \\nyou, selling for paper. Remember, I\\'ll back the losses. If I\\'m not mistaken, in three \\ndays we\\'ll have a national council or a revolution. You, Ieremia, start messengers \\naround the island to the fishers and farmers, everywhere, even to the mountain \\ngoat-hunters. Tell them to assemble at the palace three days from now.\" \\n \\n\"But the soldiers,\" Ieremia objected. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll take care of them. They haven\\'t been paid for two months. Besides, Uiliami is \\nthe queen\\'s brother. Don\\'t have too much on your shelves at a time. As soon as \\nthe soldiers show up with paper, stop selling.\" \\n \\n\"Then will they burn the stores,\" said Ieremia. \\n \\n\"Let them. King Tulifau will pay for it if they do.\" \\n \\n\"Will he pay for my shirt?\" Willie Smee demanded. \\n \\n\"That is purely a personal and private matter between you and Tui Tulifau,\" Grief \\nanswered. \\n \\n\"It\\'s beginning to split up the back,\" the supercargo lamented. \"I noticed that \\nmuch this morning when he hadn\\'t had it on ten minutes. It cost me thirty \\nshillings and I only wore it once.\" \\n \\n\"Where shall I get a dead pig?\" Ieremia asked. \\n \\n\"Kill one, of course,\" said Grief. \"Kill a small one.\" \\n \\n\"A small one is worth ten shillings.\" \\n \\n\"Then enter it in your ledger under operating expenses.\" Grief paused a moment. \\n\"If you want it particularly dead, it would be well to kill it at once.\" \\n \\nV \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n120 \\n \\n\"You have spoken well, Davida,\" said Queen Sepeli. \"This Fulualea has brought a \\nmadness with him, and Tui Tulifau is drowned in gin. If he does not grant the big \\ncouncil, I shall give him a beating. He is easy to beat when he is in drink.\" \\n \\nShe doubled up her fist, and such were her Amazonian proportions and the \\ndetermination in her face that Grief knew the council would be called. So akin \\nwas the Fitu-Ivan tongue to the Samoan that he spoke it like a native. \\n \\n\"And you, Uiliami,\" he said, \"have pointed out that the soldiers have demanded \\ncoin and refused the paper Fulualea has offered them. Tell them to take the paper \\nand see that they be paid to-morrow.\" \\n \\n\"Why trouble?\" Uiliami objected. \"The king remains happily drunk. There is much \\nmoney in the treasury. And I am content. In my house are two cases of gin and \\nmuch goods from Hawkins\\'s store.\" \\n \\n\"Excellent pig, O my brother!\" Sepeli erupted. \"Has not Davida spoken? Have you \\nno ears? When the gin and the goods in your house are gone, and no more \\ntraders come with gin and goods, and Feathers of the Sun has run away to \\nLevuka with all the cash money of Fitu-Iva, what then will you do? Cash money is \\nsilver and gold, but paper is only paper. I tell you the people are grumbling. There \\nis no fish in the palace. Yams and sweet potatoes seem to have fled from the soil, \\nfor they come not. The mountain dwellers have sent no wild goat in a week. \\nThough Feathers of the Sun compels the traders to buy copra at the old price, the \\npeople sell not, for they will have none of the paper money. Only to-day have I \\nsent messengers to twenty houses. There are no eggs. Has Feathers of the Sun \\nput a blight upon the hens? I do not know. All I know is that there are no eggs. \\nWell it is that those who drink much eat little, else would there be a palace \\nfamine. Tell your soldiers to receive their pay. Let it be in his paper money.\" \\n \\n\"And remember,\" Grief warned, \"though there be selling in the stores, when the \\nsoldiers come with their paper it will be refused. And in three days will be the \\ncouncil, and Feathers of the Sun will be as dead as a dead pig.\" \\n \\nVI \\n \\nThe day of the council found the population of the island crowded into the \\ncapital. By canoe and whaleboat, on foot and donkey-back, the five thousand \\ninhabitants of Fitu-Iva had trooped in. The three intervening days had had their \\nshare of excitement. At first there had been much selling from the sparse shelves \\nof the traders. But when the soldiers appeared, their patronage was declined and \\nthey were told to go to Fulualea for coin. \"Says it not so on the face of the paper,\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n121 \\nthe traders demanded, \"that for the asking the coin will be given in exchange?\" \\n \\nOnly the strong authority of Uiliami had prevented the burning of the traders\\' \\nhouses. As it was, one of Grief\\'s copra-sheds went up in smoke and was duly \\ncharged by Ieremia to the king\\'s account. Ieremia himself had been abused and \\nmocked, and his spectacles broken. The skin was off Willie Smee\\'s knuckles. This \\nhad been caused by three boisterous soldiers who violently struck their jaws \\nthereon in quick succession. Captain Boig was similarly injured. Peter Gee had \\ncome off undamaged, because it chanced that it was bread-baskets and not jaws \\nthat struck him on the fists. \\n \\nTui Tulifau, with Sepeli at his side and surrounded by his convivial chiefs, sat at \\nthe head of the council in the big compound. His right eye and jaw were swollen \\nas if he too had engaged in assaulting somebody\\'s fist. It was palace gossip that \\nmorning that Sepeli had administered a conjugal beating. At any rate, her spouse \\nwas sober, and his fat bulged spiritlessly through the rips in Willie Smee\\'s silk \\nshirt. His thirst was prodigious, and he was continually served with young \\ndrinking nuts. Outside the compound, held back by the army, was the mass of \\nthe common people. Only the lesser chiefs, village maids, village beaux, and \\ntalking men with their staffs of office were permitted inside. Cornelius Deasy, as \\nbefitted a high and favoured official, sat near to the right hand of the king. On the \\nleft of the queen, opposite Cornelius and surrounded by the white traders he was \\nto represent, sat Ieremia. Bereft of his spectacles, he peered short-sightedly \\nacross at the Chancellor of the Exchequer. \\n \\nIn turn, the talking man of the windward coast, the talking man of the leeward \\ncoast, and the talking man of the mountain villages, each backed by his group of \\nlesser talking men and chiefs, arose and made oration. What they said was much \\nthe same. They grumbled about the paper money. Affairs were not prosperous. No \\nmore copra was being smoked. The people were suspicious. To such a pass had \\nthings come that all people wanted to pay their debts and no one wanted to be \\npaid. Creditors made a practice of running away from debtors. The money was \\ncheap. Prices were going up and commodities were getting scarce. It cost three \\ntimes the ordinary price to buy a fowl, and then it was tough and like to die of old \\nage if not immediately sold. The outlook was gloomy. There were signs and \\nomens. There was a plague of rats in some districts. The crops were bad. The \\ncustard apples were small. The best-bearing avocado on the windward coast had \\nmysteriously shed all its leaves. The taste had gone from the mangoes. The \\nplantains were eaten by a worm. The fish had forsaken the ocean and vast \\nnumbers of tiger-sharks appeared. The wild goats had fled to inaccessible \\nsummits. The poi in the poi-pits had turned bitter. There were rumblings in the \\nmountains, night-walking of spirits; a woman of Punta-Puna had been struck \\nspeechless, and a five-legged she-goat had been born in the village of Eiho. And \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n122 \\nthat all was due to the strange money of Fulualea was the firm conviction of the \\nelders in the village councils assembled. \\n \\nUiliami spoke for the army. His men were discontented and mutinous. Though by \\nroyal decree the traders were bidden accept the money, yet did they refuse it. He \\nwould not say, but it looked as if the strange money of Fulualea had something to \\ndo with it. \\n \\nIeremia, as talking man of the traders, next spoke. When he arose, it was \\nnoticeable that he stood with legs spraddled over a large grass basket. He dwelt \\nupon the cloth of the traders, its variety and beauty and durability, which so \\nexceeded the Fitu-Ivan wet-pounded tapa, fragile and coarse. No one wore tapa \\nany more. Yet all had worn tapa, and nothing but tapa, before the traders came. \\nThere was the mosquito-netting, sold for a song, that the cleverest Fitu-Ivan net-\\nweaver could not duplicate in a thousand years. He enlarged on the incomparable \\nvirtues of rifles, axes, and steel fishhooks, down through needles, thread and \\ncotton fish-lines to white flour and kerosene oil. \\n \\nHe expounded at length, with firstlies and secondlies and all minor subdivisions \\nof argument, on organization, and order, and civilization. He contended that the \\ntrader was the bearer of civilization, and that the trader must be protected in his \\ntrade else he would not come. Over to the westward were islands which would not \\nprotect the traders. What was the result? The traders would not come, and the \\npeople were like wild animals. They wore no clothes, no silk shirts (here he peered \\nand blinked significantly at the king), and they ate one another. \\n \\nThe queer paper of the Feathers of the Sun was not money. The traders knew \\nwhat money was, and they would not receive it. If Fitu-Iva persisted in trying to \\nmake them receive it they would go away and never come back. And then the \\nFitu-Ivans, who had forgotten how to make tapa, would run around naked and \\neat one another. \\n \\nMuch more he said, talking a solid hour, and always coming back to what their \\ndire condition would be when the traders came no more. \"And in that day,\" he \\nperorated, \"how will the Fitu-Ivan be known in the great world? Kai-kanak* will \\nmen call him. \\'Kiakanak! Kai-kanak!\" \\n \\n     * Man-eater. \\n \\nTui Tulifau spoke briefly. The case had been presented, he said, for the people, \\nthe army, and the traders. It was now time for Feathers of the Sun to present his \\nside. It could not be denied that he had wrought wonders with his financial \\nsystem. \"Many times has he explained to me the working of his system,\" Tui Tulif \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n123 \\nau concluded. \"It is very simple. And now he will explain it to you.\" \\n \\nIt was a conspiracy of the white traders, Cornelius contended. Ieremia was right \\nso far as concerned the manifold blessings of white flour and kerosene oil. Fitu-\\nIva did not want to become kai-kanak. Fitu-Iva wanted civilization; it wanted \\nmore and more civilization. Now that was the very point, and they must follow \\nhim closely. Paper money was an earmark of higher civilization. That was why he, \\nthe Feathers of the Sun, had introduced it. And that was why the traders opposed \\nit. They did not want to see Fitu-Iva civilized. Why did they come across the far \\nocean stretches with their goods to Fitu-Iva? He, the Feathers of the Sun, would \\ntell them why, to their faces, in grand council assembled. In their own countries \\nmen were too civilized to let the traders make the immense profits that they made \\nout of the Fitu-Ivans. If the Fitu-Ivans became properly civilized, the trade of the \\ntraders would be gone. In that day every Fitu-Ivan could become a trader if he \\npleased. \\n \\nThat was why the white traders fought the system of paper money, that he, the \\nFeathers of the Sun, had brought. Why was he called the Feathers of the Sun? \\nBecause he was the Light-Bringer from the World Beyond the Sky. The paper \\nmoney was the light. The robbing white traders could not flourish in the light. \\nTherefore they fought the light. \\n \\nHe would prove it to the good people of Fitu-Iva, and he would prove it out of the \\nmouths of his enemies. It was a well-known fact that all highly civilized countries \\nhad paper-money systems. He would ask Ieremia if this was not so. \\n \\nIeremia did not answer. \\n \\n\"You see,\" Cornelius went on, \"he makes no answer. He cannot deny what is true. \\nEngland, France, Germany, America, all the great Papalangi countries, have the \\npaper-money system. It works. From century to century it works. I challenge you, \\nIeremia, as an honest man, as one who was once a zealous worker in the Lord\\'s \\nvineyard, I challenge you to deny that in the great Papalangi countries the system \\nworks.\" \\n \\nIeremia could not deny, and his fingers played nervously with the fastening of the \\nbasket on his knees. \\n \\n\"You see, it is as I have said,\" Cornelius continued. \"Ieremia agrees that it is so. \\nTherefore, I ask you, all good people of Fitu-Iva, if a system is good for the \\nPapalangi countries, why is it not good for Fitu-Iva?\" \\n \\n\"It is not the same!\" Ieremia cried. \"The paper of the Feathers of the Sun is \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n124 \\ndifferent from the paper of the great countries.\" \\n \\nThat Cornelius had been prepared for this was evident. He held up a Fitu-Ivan \\nnote that was recognized by all. \\n \\n\"What is that?\" he demanded. \\n \\n\"Paper, mere paper,\" was Ieremia\\'s reply. \\n \\n\"And that?\" \\n \\nThis time Cornelius held up a Bank of England note. \\n \\n\"It is the paper money of the English,\" he explained to the Council, at the same \\ntime extending it for Ieremia to examine. \"Is it not true, Ieremia, that it is paper \\nmoney of the English?\" \\n \\nIeremia nodded reluctantly. \\n \\n\"You have said that the paper money of Fitu-Iva was paper, now how about this \\nof the English? What is it?.... You must answer like a true man... All wait for your \\nanswer, Ieremia.\" \\n \\n\"It is--it is----\" the puzzled Ieremia began, then spluttered helplessly, the fallacy \\nbeyond his penetration. \\n \\n\"Paper, mere paper,\" Cornelius concluded for him, imitating his halting utterance. \\n \\nConviction sat on the faces of all. The king clapped his hands admiringly and \\nmurmured, \"It is most clear, very clear.\" \\n \\n\"You see, he himself acknowledges it.\" Assured triumph was in Deasy\\'s voice and \\nbearing. \"He knows of no difference. There is no difference. \\'Tis the very image of \\nmoney. \\'Tis money itself.\" \\n \\nIn the meantime Grief was whispering in Ieremia\\'s ear, who nodded and began to \\nspeak. \\n \\n\"But it is well known to all the Papalangi that the English Government will pay \\ncoin money for the paper.\" \\n \\nDeasy\\'s victory was now absolute. He held aloft a Fitu-Ivan note. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n125 \\n\"Is it not so written on this paper as well?\" \\n \\nAgain Grief whispered. \\n \\n\"That Fitu-Iva will pay coin money?\" asked Ieremia \\n \\n\"It is so written.\" \\n \\nA third time Grief prompted. \\n \\n\"On demand?\" asked Ieremia. \\n \\n\"On demand,\" Cornelius assured him. \\n \\n\"Then I demand coin money now,\" said Ieremia, drawing a small package of notes \\nfrom the pouch at his girdle. \\n \\nCornelius scanned the package with a quick, estimating eye. \\n \\n\"Very well,\" he agreed. \"I shall give you the coin money now. How much?\" \\n \\n\"And we will see the system work,\" the king proclaimed, partaking in his \\nChancellor\\'s triumph. \\n \\n\"You have heard!--He will give coin money now!\" Ieremia cried in a loud voice to \\nthe assemblage. \\n \\nAt the same time he plunged both hands in the basket and drew forth many \\npackages of Fitu-Ivan notes. It was noticed that a peculiar odour was adrift about \\nthe council. \\n \\n\"I have here,\" Ieremia announced, \"one thousand and twenty-eight pounds twelve \\nshillings and sixpence. Here is a sack to put the coin money in.\" \\n \\nCornelius recoiled. He had not expected such a sum, and everywhere about the \\ncouncil his uneasy eyes showed him chiefs and talking men drawing out bundles \\nof notes. The army, its two months\\' pay in its hands, pressed forward to the edge \\nof the council, while behind it the populace, with more money, invaded the \\ncompound. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis a run on the bank you\\'ve precipitated,\" he said reproachfully to Grief. \\n \\n\"Here is the sack to put the coin money in,\" Ieremia urged. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n126 \\n \\n\"It must be postponed,\" Cornelius said desperately, \"\\'Tis not in banking hours.\" \\n \\nIeremia flourished a package of money. \"Nothing of banking hours is written here. \\nIt says on demand, and I now demand.\" \\n \\n\"Let them come to-morrow, O Tui Tulifau,\" Cornelius appealed to the king. \"They \\nshall be paid to-morrow.\" \\n \\nTui Tulifau hesitated, but his spouse glared at him, her brawny arm tensing as \\nthe fist doubled into a redoubtable knot, Tui Tulifau tried to look away, but failed. \\nHe cleared his throat nervously. \\n \\n\"We will see the system work,\" he decreed. \"The people have come far.\" \\n \\n\"\\'Tis good money you\\'re asking me to pay out,\" Deasy muttered in a low voice to \\nthe king. \\n \\nSepeli caught what he said, and grunted so savagely as to startle the king, who \\ninvoluntarily shrank away from her. \\n \\n\"Forget not the pig,\" Grief whispered to Ieremia, who immediately stood up. \\n \\nWith a sweeping gesture he stilled the babel of voices that was beginning to rise. \\n \\n\"It was an ancient and honourable custom of Fitu-Iva,\" he said, \"that when a man \\nwas proved a notorious evildoer his joints were broken with a club and he was \\nstaked out at low water to be fed upon alive by the sharks. Unfortunately, that \\nday is past. Nevertheless another ancient and honourable custom remains with \\nus. You all know what it is. When a man is a proven thief and liar he shall be \\nstruck with a dead pig.\" \\n \\nHis right hand went into the basket, and, despite the lack of his spectacles, the \\ndead pig that came into view landed accurately on Deasy\\'s neck. With such force \\nwas it thrown that the Chancellor, in his sitting position, toppled over sidewise. \\nBefore he could recover, Sepeli, with an agility unexpected of a woman who \\nweighed two hundred and sixty pounds, had sprung across to him. One hand \\nclutched his shirt collar, the other hand brandished the pig, and amid the vast \\nuproar of a delighted kingdom she royally swatted him. \\n \\nThere remained nothing for Tui Tulifau but to put a good face on his favourite\\'s \\ndisgrace, and his mountainous fat lay back on the mats and shook in a gale of \\nGargantuan laughter. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n127 \\n \\nWhen Sepeli dropped both pig and Chancellor, a talking man from the windward \\ncoast picked up the carcass. Cornelius was on his feet and running, when the pig \\ncaught him on the legs and tripped him. The people and the army, with shouts \\nand laughter, joined in the sport. \\n \\nTwist and dodge as he would, everywhere the ex-Chancellor of the Exchequer was \\nmet or overtaken by the flying pig. He scuttled like a frightened rabbit in and out \\namong the avocados and the palms. No hand was laid upon him, and his \\ntormentors made way before him, but ever they pursued, and ever the pig flew as \\nfast as hands could pick it up. \\n \\nAs the chase died away down the Broom Road, Grief led the traders to the royal \\ntreasury, and the day was well over ere the last Fitu-Ivan bank note had been \\nredeemed with coin. \\n \\nVII \\n \\nThrough the mellow cool of twilight a man paddled out from a clump of jungle to \\nthe Cantani. It was a leaky and abandoned dugout, and he paddled slowly, \\ndesisting from time to time in order to bale. The Kanaka sailors giggled gleefully \\nas he came alongside and painfully drew himself over the rail. He was bedraggled \\nand filthy, and seemed half-dazed. \\n \\n\"Could I speak a word with you, Mr. Grief?\" he asked sadly and humbly. \\n \\n\"Sit to leeward and farther away,\" Grief answered. \"A little farther away. That\\'s \\nbetter.\" \\n \\nCornelius sat down on the rail and held his head in both his hands. \\n \\n\"\\'Tis right,\" he said. \"I\\'m as fragrant as a recent battlefield. My head aches to \\nburstin\\'. My neck is fair broken. The teeth are loose in my jaws. There\\'s nests of \\nhornets buzzin\\' in my ears. My medulla oblongata is dislocated. I\\'ve been through \\nearthquake and pestilence, and the heavens have rained pigs.\" He paused with a \\nsigh that ended in a groan. \"\\'Tis a vision of terrible death. One that the poets \\nnever dreamed. To be eaten by rats, or boiled in oil, or pulled apart by wild \\nhorses--that would be unpleasant. But to be beaten to death with a dead pig!\" He \\nshuddered at the awfulness of it. \"Sure it transcends the human imagination.\" \\n \\nCaptain Boig sniffed audibly, moved his canvas chair farther to windward, and \\nsat down again. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n128 \\n\"I hear you\\'re runnin\\' over to Yap, Mr. Grief,\" Cornelius went on. \"An\\' two things \\nI\\'m wantin\\' to beg of you: a passage an\\' the nip of the old smoky I refused the \\nnight you landed.\" \\n \\nGrief clapped his hands for the black steward and ordered soap and towels. \\n \\n\"Go for\\'ard, Cornelius, and take a scrub first,\" he said. \"The boy will bring you a \\npair of dungarees and a shirt. And by the way, before you go, how was it we \\nfound more coin in the treasury than paper you had issued?\" \\n \\n\"\\'Twas the stake of my own I\\'d brought with me for the adventure.\" \\n \\n\"We\\'ve decided to charge the demurrage and other expenses and loss to Tui \\nTulifau,\" Grief said. \"So the balance we found will be turned over to you. But ten \\nshillings must be deducted.\" \\n \\n\"For what?\" \\n \\n\"Do you think dead pigs grow on trees? The sum of ten shillings for that pig is \\nentered in the accounts.\" \\n \\nCornelius bowed his assent with a shudder. \\n \\n\"Sure it\\'s grateful I am it wasn\\'t a fifteen-shilling pig or a twenty-shilling one.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n129 \\n \\nChapter Eight--THE PEARLS OF PARLAY \\n \\n I \\n \\nThe Kanaka helmsman put the wheel down, and the Malahini slipped into the eye \\nof the wind and righted to an even keel.

Though it was early morning and the wind brisk, \\nthe five white men who lounged on the poop-deck were scantily clad.

I was only an apprentice, but I can \\nremember that well enough. Brand new, four-masted steel ship; first voyage; \\nbroke the old man\\'s heart. He\\'d been forty years in the company. Just faded way \\nand died the next year.\" \\n \\nDespite the wind and the early hour, the heat was suffocating. The wind \\nwhispered coolness, but did not deliver coolness. It might have blown off the \\nSahara, save for the extreme humidity with which it was laden. There was no fog \\nnor mist, nor hint of fog or mist, yet the dimness of distance produced the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n130 \\nimpression. There were no defined clouds, yet so thickly were the heavens \\ncovered by a messy cloud-pall that the sun failed to shine through. \\n \\n\"Ready about!\" Captain Warfield ordered with slow sharpness. \\n \\nThe brown, breech-clouted Kanaka sailors moved languidly but quickly to head-\\nsheets and boom-tackles. \\n \\n\"Hard a-lee!\" \\n \\nThe helmsman ran the spokes over with no hint of gentling, and the Malahini \\ndarted prettily into the wind and about. \\n \\n\"Jove! she\\'s a witch!\" was Mulhall\\'s appreciation. \"I didn\\'t know you South Sea \\ntraders sailed yachts.\" \\n \\n\"She was a Gloucester fisherman originally,\" Grief explained, \"and the Gloucester \\nboats are all yachts when it comes to build, rig, and sailing.\" \\n \\n\"But you\\'re heading right in--why don\\'t you make it?\" came the Englishman\\'s \\ncriticism. \\n \\n\"Try it, Captain Warfield,\" Grief suggested. \"Show him what a lagoon entrance is \\non a strong ebb.\" \\n \\n\"Close-and-by!\" the captain ordered. \\n \\n\"Close-and-by,\" the Kanaka repeated, easing half a spoke. \\n \\nThe Malahini laid squarely into the narrow passage which was the lagoon \\nentrance of a large, long, and narrow oval of an atoll. The atoll was shaped as if \\nthree atolls, in the course of building, had collided and coalesced and failed to \\nrear the partition walls. Cocoanut palms grew in spots on the circle of sand, and \\nthere were many gaps where the sand was too low to the sea for cocoanuts, and \\nthrough which could be seen the protected lagoon where the water lay flat like the \\nruffled surface of a mirror. Many square miles of water were in the irregular \\nlagoon, all of which surged out on the ebb through the one narrow channel. So \\nnarrow was the channel, so large the outflow of water, that the passage was more \\nlike the rapids of a river than the mere tidal entrance to an atoll. The water boiled \\nand whirled and swirled and drove outward in a white foam of stiff, serrated \\nwaves. Each heave and blow on her bows of the upstanding waves of the current \\nswung the Malahini off the straight lead and wedged her as with wedges of steel \\ntoward the side of the passage. Part way in she was, when her closeness to the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n131 \\ncoral edge compelled her to go about. On the opposite tack, broadside to the \\ncurrent, she swept seaward with the current\\'s speed. \\n \\n\"Now\\'s the time for that new and expensive engine of yours,\" Grief jeered good-\\nnaturedly. \\n \\nThat the engine was a sore point with Captain Warfield was patent. He had \\nbegged and badgered for it, until in the end Grief had given his consent. \\n \\n\"It will pay for itself yet,\" the captain retorted, \"You wait and see. It beats \\ninsurance and you know the underwriters won\\'t stand for insurance in the \\nPaumotus.\" \\n \\nGrief pointed to a small cutter beating up astern of them on the same course. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll wager a five-franc piece the little Nuhiva beats us in.\" \\n \\n\"Sure,\" Captain Warfield agreed. \"She\\'s overpowered. We\\'re like a liner alongside \\nof her, and we\\'ve only got forty horsepower. She\\'s got ten horse, and she\\'s a little \\nskimming dish. She could skate across the froth of hell, but just the same she \\ncan\\'t buck this current. It\\'s running ten knots right now.\" \\n \\nAnd at the rate of ten knots, buffeted and jerkily rolled, the Malahini went out to \\nsea with the tide. \\n \\n\"She\\'ll slacken in half an hour--then we\\'ll make headway,\" Captain Warfield said, \\nwith an irritation explained by his next words. \"He has no right to call it Parlay. \\nIt\\'s down on the admiralty charts, and the French charts, too, as Hikihoho. \\nBougainville discovered it and named it from the natives.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s the name matter?\" the supercargo demanded, taking advantage of speech \\nto pause with arms shoved into the sleeves of the undershirt. \"There it is, right \\nunder our nose, and old Parlay is there with the pearls.\" \\n \\n\"Who see them pearl?\" Hermann queried, looking from one to another. \\n \\n\"It\\'s well known,\" was the supercargo\\'s reply. He turned to the steersman: \"Tai-\\nHotauri, what about old Parlay\\'s pearls?\" \\n \\nThe Kanaka, pleased and self-conscious, took and gave a spoke. \\n \\n\"My brother dive for Parlay three, four month, and he make much talk about \\npearl. Hikihoho very good place for pearl.\" \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n132 \\n \\n\"And the pearl-buyers have never got him to part with a pearl,\" the captain broke \\nin. \\n \\n\"And they say he had a hatful for Armande when he sailed for Tahiti,\" the \\nsupercargo carried on the tale. \"That\\'s fifteen years ago, and he\\'s been adding to \\nit ever since--stored the shell as well. Everybody\\'s seen that--hundreds of tons of \\nit. They say the lagoon\\'s fished clean now. Maybe that\\'s why he\\'s announced the \\nauction.\" \\n \\n\"If he really sells, this will be the biggest year\\'s output of pearls in the Paumotus,\" \\nGrief said. \\n \\n\"I say, now, look here!\" Mulhall burst forth, harried by the humid heat as much \\nas the rest of them. \"What\\'s it all about? Who\\'s the old beachcomber anyway? \\nWhat are all these pearls? Why so secretious about it?\" \\n \\n\"Hikihoho belongs to old Parlay,\" the supercargo answered. \"He\\'s got a fortune in \\npearls, saved up for years and years, and he sent the word out weeks ago that \\nhe\\'d auction them off to the buyers to-morrow. See those schooners\\' masts \\nsticking up inside the lagoon?\" \\n \\n\"Eight, so I see,\" said Hermann. \\n \\n\"What are they doing in a dinky atoll like this?\" the supercargo went on. \"There \\nisn\\'t a schooner-load of copra a year in the place. They\\'ve come for the auction. \\nThat\\'s why we\\'re here. That\\'s why the little Nuhiva\\'s bumping along astern there, \\nthough what she can buy is beyond me. Narii Herring--he\\'s an English Jew half-\\ncaste--owns and runs her, and his only assets are his nerve, his debts, and his \\nwhiskey bills. He\\'s a genius in such things. He owes so much that there isn\\'t a \\nmerchant in Papeete who isn\\'t interested in his welfare. They go out of their way \\nto throw work in his way. They\\'ve got to, and a dandy stunt it is for Narii. Now I \\nowe nobody. What\\'s the result? If I fell down in a fit on the beach they\\'d let me lie \\nthere and die. They wouldn\\'t lose anything. But Narii Herring?--what wouldn\\'t \\nthey do if he fell in a fit? Their best wouldn\\'t be too good for him. They\\'ve got too \\nmuch money tied up in him to let him lie. They\\'d take him into their homes and \\nhand-nurse him like a brother. Let me tell you, honesty in paying bills ain\\'t what \\nit\\'s cracked up to be.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s this Narii chap got to do with it?\" was the Englishman\\'s short-tempered \\ndemand. And, turning to Grief, he said, \"What\\'s all this pearl nonsense? Begin at \\nthe beginning.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n133 \\n\"You\\'ll have to help me out,\" Grief warned the others, as he began. \"Old Parlay is \\na character. From what I\\'ve seen of him I believe he\\'s partly and mildly insane. \\nAnyway, here\\'s the story: Parlay\\'s a full-blooded Frenchman. He told me once that \\nhe came from Paris. His accent is the true Parisian. He arrived down here in the \\nold days. Went to trading and all the rest. That\\'s how he got in on Hikihoho. \\nCame in trading when trading was the real thing. About a hundred miserable \\nPaumotans lived on the island. He married the queen--native fashion. When she \\ndied, everything was his. Measles came through, and there weren\\'t more than a \\ndozen survivors. He fed them, and worked them, and was king. Now before the \\nqueen died she gave birth to a girl. That\\'s Armande. When she was three he sent \\nher to the convent at Papeete. When she was seven or eight he sent her to France. \\nYou begin to glimpse the situation. The best and most aristocratic convent in \\nFrance was none too good for the only daughter of a Paumotan island king and \\ncapitalist, and you know the old country French draw no colour line. She was \\neducated like a princess, and she accepted herself in much the same way. Also, \\nshe thought she was all-white, and never dreamed of a bar sinister. \\n \\n\"Now comes the tragedy. The old man had always been cranky and erratic, and \\nhe\\'d played the despot on Hikihoho so long that he\\'d got the idea in his head that \\nthere was nothing wrong with the king--or the princess either. When Armande \\nwas eighteen he sent for her. He had slews and slathers of money, as Yankee Bill \\nwould say. He\\'d built the big house on Hikihoho, and a whacking fine bungalow \\nin Papeete. She was to arrive on the mail boat from New Zealand, and he sailed in \\nhis schooner to meet her at Papeete. And he might have carried the situation off, \\ndespite the hens and bull-beasts of Papeete, if it hadn\\'t been for the hurricane. \\nThat was the year, wasn\\'t it, when Manu-Huhi was swept and eleven hundred \\ndrowned?\" \\n \\nThe others nodded, and Captain Warfield said: \"I was in the Magpie that blow, \\nand we went ashore, all hands and the cook, Magpie and all, a quarter of a mile \\ninto the cocoanuts at the head of Taiohae Bay--and it a supposedly hurricane-\\nproof harbour.\" \\n \\n\"Well,\" Grief continued, \"old Parlay got caught in the same blow, and arrived in \\nPapeete with his hatful of pearls three weeks too late. He\\'d had to jack up his \\nschooner and build half a mile of ways before he could get her back into the sea. \\n \\n\"And in the meantime there was Armande at Papeete. Nobody called on her. She \\ndid, French fashion, make the initial calls on the Governor and the port doctor. \\nThey saw her, but neither of their hen-wives was at home to her nor returned the \\ncall. She was out of caste, without caste, though she had never dreamed it, and \\nthat was the gentle way they broke the information to her. There was a gay young \\nlieutenant on the French cruiser. He lost his heart to her, but not his head. You \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n134 \\ncan imagine the shock to this young woman, refined, beautiful, raised like an \\naristocrat, pampered with the best of old France that money could buy. And you \\ncan guess the end.\" He shrugged his shoulders. \"There was a Japanese servant in \\nthe bungalow. He saw it. Said she did it with the proper spirit of the Samurai. \\nTook a stiletto--no thrust, no drive, no wild rush for annihilation--took the \\nstiletto, placed the point carefully against her heart, and with both hands, slowly \\nand steadily, pressed home. \\n \\n\"Old Parlay arrived after that with his pearls. There was one single one of them, \\nthey say, worth sixty thousand francs. Peter Gee saw it, and has told me he \\noffered that much for it. The old man went clean off for a while. They had him \\nstrait-jacketed in the Colonial Club two days----\" \\n \\n\"His wife\\'s uncle, an old Paumotan, cut him out of the jacket and turned him \\nloose,\" the supercargo corroborated. \\n \\n\"And then old Parlay proceeded to eat things up,\" Grief went on. \"Pumped three \\nbullets into the scalawag of a lieutenant----\" \\n \\n\"Who lay in sick bay for three months,\" Captain Warfield contributed. \\n \\n\"Flung a glass of wine in the Governor\\'s face; fought a duel with the port doctor; \\nbeat up his native servants; wrecked the hospital; broke two ribs and the \\ncollarbone of a man nurse, and escaped; and went down to his schooner, a gun in \\neach hand, daring the chief of police and all the gendarmes to arrest him, and \\nsailed for Hikihoho. And they say he\\'s never left the island since.\" \\n \\nThe supercargo nodded. \"That was fifteen years ago, and he\\'s never budged.\" \\n \\n\"And added to his pearls,\" said the captain. \"He\\'s a blithering old lunatic. Makes \\nmy flesh creep. He\\'s a regular Finn.\" \\n \\n\"What\\'s that?\" Mulhall inquired. \\n \\n\"Bosses the weather--that\\'s what the natives believe, at any rate. Ask Tai-Hotauri \\nthere. Hey, Tai-Hotauri! what you think old Parlay do along weather?\" \\n \\n\"Just the same one big weather devil,\" came the Kanaka\\'s answer. \"I know. He \\nwant big blow, he make big blow. He want no wind, no wind come.\" \\n \\n\"A regular old Warlock,\" said Mulhall. \\n \\n\"No good luck them pearl,\" Tai-Hotauri blurted out, rolling his head ominously. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n135 \\n\"He say he sell. Plenty schooner come. Then he make big hurricane, everybody \\nfinish, you see. All native men say so.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s hurricane season now,\" Captain War-field laughed morosely. \"They\\'re not far \\nwrong. It\\'s making for something right now, and I\\'d feel better if the Malahini was \\na thousand miles away from here.\" \\n \\n\"He is a bit mad,\" Grief concluded. \"I\\'ve tried to get his point of view. It\\'s--well, it\\'s \\nmixed. For eighteen years he\\'d centred everything on Armande. Half the time he \\nbelieves she\\'s still alive, not yet come back from France. That\\'s one of the reasons \\nhe held on to the pearls. And all the time he hates white men. He never forgets \\nthey killed her, though a great deal of the time he forgets she\\'s dead. Hello! \\nWhere\\'s your wind?\" \\n \\nThe sails bellied emptily overhead, and Captain Warfield grunted his disgust. \\nIntolerable as the heat had been, in the absence of wind it was almost \\noverpowering. The sweat oozed out on all their faces, and now one, and again \\nanother, drew deep breaths, involuntarily questing for more air. \\n \\n\"Here she comes again--an eight point haul! Boom-tackles across! Jump!\" \\n \\nThe Kanakas sprang to the captain\\'s orders, and for five minutes the schooner \\nlaid directly into the passage and even gained on the current. Again the breeze fell \\nflat, then puffed from the old quarter, compelling a shift back of sheets and \\ntackles. \\n \\n\"Here comes the Nuhiva\" Grief said. \"She\\'s got her engine on. Look at her skim.\" \\n \\n\"All ready?\" the captain asked the engineer, a Portuguese half-caste, whose head \\nand shoulders protruded from the small hatch just for\\'ard of the cabin, and who \\nwiped the sweat from his face with a bunch of greasy waste. \\n \\n\"Sure,\" he replied. \\n \\n\"Then let her go.\" \\n \\nThe engineer disappeared into his den, and a moment later the exhaust muffler \\ncoughed and spluttered overside. But the schooner could not hold her lead. The \\nlittle cutter made three feet to her two and was quickly alongside and forging \\nahead. Only natives were on her deck, and the man steering waved his hand in \\nderisive greeting and farewell. \\n \\n\"That\\'s Narii Herring,\" Grief told Mulhall. \"The big fellow at the wheel--the \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n136 \\nnerviest and most conscienceless scoundrel in the Paumotus.\" \\n \\nFive minutes later a cry of joy from their own Kanakas centred all eyes on the \\nNuhiva. Her engine had broken down and they were overtaking her. The \\nMalahini\\'s sailors sprang into the rigging and jeered as they went by; the little \\ncutter heeled over by the wind with a bone in her teeth, going backward on the \\ntide. \\n \\n\"Some engine that of ours,\" Grief approved, as the lagoon opened before them and \\nthe course was changed across it to the anchorage. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield was visibly cheered, though he merely grunted, \"It\\'ll pay for \\nitself, never fear.\" \\n \\nThe Malahini ran well into the centre of the little fleet ere she found swinging \\nroom to anchor. \\n \\n\"There\\'s Isaacs on the Dolly,\" Grief observed, with a hand wave of greeting. \"And \\nPeter Gee\\'s on the Roberta. Couldn\\'t keep him away from a pearl sale like this. \\nAnd there\\'s Francini on the Cactus. They\\'re all here, all the buyers. Old Parlay \\nwill surely get a price.\" \\n \\n\"They haven\\'t repaired the engine yet,\" Captain Warfield grumbled gleefully. \\n \\nHe was looking across the lagoon to where the Nuhiva\\'s sails showed through the \\nsparse cocoa-nuts. \\n \\nII \\n \\nThe house of Parlay was a big two-story frame affair, built of California lumber, \\nwith a galvanized iron roof. So disproportionate was it to the slender ring of the \\natoll that it showed out upon the sand-strip and above it like some monstrous \\nexcrescence. They of the Malahini paid the courtesy visit ashore immediately after \\nanchoring. Other captains and buyers were in the big room examining the pearls \\nthat were to be auctioned next day. Paumotan servants, natives of Hikihoho, and \\nrelatives of the owner, moved about dispensing whiskey and absinthe. And \\nthrough the curious company moved Parlay himself, cackling and sneering, the \\nwithered wreck of what had once been a tall and powerful man. His eyes were \\ndeep sunken and feverish, his cheeks fallen in and cavernous. The hair of his \\nhead seemed to have come out in patches, and his mustache and imperial had \\nshed in the same lopsided way. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n137 \\n\"Jove!\" Mulhall muttered under his breath. \"A long-legged Napoleon the Third, \\nbut burnt out, baked, and fire-crackled. And mangy! No wonder he crooks his \\nhead to one side. He\\'s got to keep the balance.\" \\n \\n\"Goin\\' to have a blow,\" was the old man\\'s greeting to Grief. \"You must think a lot \\nof pearls to come a day like this.\" \\n \\n\"They\\'re worth going to inferno for,\" Grief laughed genially back, running his eyes \\nover the surface of the table covered by the display. \\n \\n\"Other men have already made that journey for them,\" old Parlay cackled. \"See \\nthis one!\" He pointed to a large, perfect pearl the size of a small walnut that lay \\napart on a piece of chamois. \"They offered me sixty thousand francs for it in \\nTahiti. They\\'ll bid as much and more for it to-morrow, if they aren\\'t blown away. \\nWell, that pearl, it was found by my cousin, my cousin by marriage. He was a \\nnative, you see. Also, he was a thief. He hid it. It was mine. His cousin, who was \\nalso my cousin--we\\'re all related here--killed him for it and fled away in a cutter \\nto Noo-Nau. I pursued, but the chief of Noo-Nau had killed him for it before I got \\nthere. Oh, yes, there are many dead men represented on the table there. Have a \\ndrink, Captain. Your face is not familiar. You are new in the islands?\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s Captain Robinson of the Roberta,\" Grief said, introducing them. \\n \\nIn the meantime Mulhall had shaken hands with Peter Gee. \\n \\n\"I never fancied there were so many pearls in the world,\" Mulhall said. \\n \\n\"Nor have I ever seen so many together at one time,\" Peter Gee admitted. \\n \\n\"What ought they to be worth?\" \\n \\n\"Fifty or sixty thousand pounds--and that\\'s to us buyers. In Paris----\" He \\nshrugged his shoulders and lifted his eyebrows at the incommunicableness of the \\nsum. \\n \\nMulhall wiped the sweat from his eyes. All were sweating profusely and breathing \\nhard. There was no ice in the drink that was served, and whiskey and absinthe \\nwent down lukewarm. \\n \\n\"Yes, yes,\" Parlay was cackling. \"Many dead men lie on the table there. I know \\nthose pearls, all of them. You see those three! Perfectly matched, aren\\'t they? A \\ndiver from Easter Island got them for me inside a week. Next week a shark got \\nhim; took his arm off and blood poison did the business. And that big baroque \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n138 \\nthere--nothing much--if I\\'m offered twenty francs for it to-morrow I\\'ll be in luck; it \\ncame out of twenty-two fathoms of water. The man was from Raratonga. He broke \\nall diving records. He got it out of twenty-two fathoms. I saw him. And he burst \\nhis lungs at the same time, or got the \\'bends,\\' for he died in two hours. He died \\nscreaming. They could hear him for miles. He was the most powerful native I ever \\nsaw. Half a dozen of my divers have died of the bends. And more men will die, \\nmore men will die.\" \\n \\n\"Oh, hush your croaking, Parlay,\" chided one of the captains. \"It ain\\'t going to \\nblow.\" \\n \\n\"If I was a strong man, I couldn\\'t get up hook and get out fast enough,\" the old \\nman retorted in the falsetto of age. \"Not if I was a strong man with the taste for \\nwine yet in my mouth. But not you. You\\'ll all stay, I wouldn\\'t advise you if I \\nthought you\\'d go, You can\\'t drive buzzards away from the carrion. Have another \\ndrink, my brave sailor-men. Well, well, what men will dare for a few little oyster \\ndrops! There they are, the beauties! Auction to-morrow, at ten sharp. Old Parlay\\'s \\nselling out, and the buzzards are gathering--old Parlay who was a stronger man \\nin his day than any of them and who will see most of them dead yet.\" \\n \\n\"If he isn\\'t a vile old beast!\" the supercargo of the Malahini whispered to Peter \\nGee. \\n \\n\"What if she does blow?\" said the captain of the Dolly. \"Hikihoho\\'s never been \\nswept.\" \\n \\n\"The more reason she will be, then,\" Captain Warfield answered back. \"I wouldn\\'t \\ntrust her.\" \\n \\n\"Who\\'s croaking now?\" Grief reproved. \\n \\n\"I\\'d hate to lose that new engine before it paid for itself,\" Captain Warfield replied \\ngloomily. \\n \\nParlay skipped with astonishing nimbleness across the crowded room to the \\nbarometer on the wall. \\n \\n\"Take a look, my brave sailormen!\" he cried exultantly. \\n \\nThe man nearest read the glass. The sobering effect showed plainly on his face. \\n \\n\"It\\'s dropped ten,\" was all he said, yet every face went anxious, and there was a \\nlook as if every man desired immediately to start for the door. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n139 \\n \\n\"Listen!\" Parlay commanded. \\n \\nIn the silence the outer surf seemed to have become unusually loud. There was a \\ngreat rumbling roar. \\n \\n\"A big sea is beginning to set,\" some one said; and there was a movement to the \\nwindows, where all gathered. \\n \\nThrough the sparse cocoanuts they gazed seaward. An orderly succession of huge \\nsmooth seas was rolling down upon the coral shore. For some minutes they gazed \\non the strange sight and talked in low voices, and in those few minutes it was \\nmanifest to all that the waves were increasing in size. It was uncanny, this rising \\nsea in a dead calm, and their voices unconsciously sank lower. Old Parlay \\nshocked them with his abrupt cackle. \\n \\n\"There is yet time to get away to sea, brave gentlemen. You can tow across the \\nlagoon with your whaleboats.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s all right, old man,\" said Darling, the mate of the Cactus, a stalwart youngster \\nof twenty-five. \"The blow\\'s to the southward and passing on. We\\'ll not get a whiff \\nof it.\" \\n \\nAn air of relief went through the room. Conversations were started, and the voices \\nbecame louder. Several of the buyers even went back to the table to continue the \\nexamination of the pearls. \\n \\nParlay\\'s shrill cackle rose higher. \\n \\n\"That\\'s right,\" he encouraged. \"If the world was coming to an end you\\'d go on \\nbuying.\" \\n \\n\"We\\'ll buy these to-morrow just the same,\" Isaacs assured him. \\n \\n\"Then you\\'ll be doing your buying in hell.\" \\n \\nThe chorus of incredulous laughter incensed the old man. He turned fiercely on \\nDarling. \\n \\n\"Since when have children like you come to the knowledge of storms? And who is \\nthe man who has plotted the hurricane-courses of the Paumotus? What books \\nwill you find it in? I sailed the Paumotus before the oldest of you drew breath. I \\nknow. To the eastward the paths of the hurricanes are on so wide a circle they \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n140 \\nmake a straight line. To the westward here they make a sharp curve. Remember \\nyour chart. How did it happen the hurricane of \\'91 swept Auri and Hiolau? The \\ncurve, my brave boy, the curve! In an hour, or two or three at most, will come the \\nwind. Listen to that!\" \\n \\nA vast rumbling crash shook the coral foundations of the atoll. The house \\nquivered to it. The native servants, with bottles of whiskey and absinthe in their \\nhands, shrank together as if for protection and stared with fear through the \\nwindows at the mighty wash of the wave lapping far up the beach to the corner of \\na copra-shed. \\n \\nParlay looked at the barometer, giggled, and leered around at his guests. Captain \\nWar-field strode across to see. \\n \\n\"29:75,\" he read. \"She\\'s gone down five more. By God! the old devil\\'s right. She\\'s \\na-coming, and it\\'s me, for one, for aboard.\" \\n \\n\"It\\'s growing dark,\" Isaacs half whispered. \\n \\n\"Jove! it\\'s like a stage,\" Mulhall said to Grief, looking at his watch. \"Ten o\\'clock in \\nthe morning, and it\\'s like twilight. Down go the lights for the tragedy. Where\\'s the \\nslow music!\" \\n \\nIn answer, another rumbling crash shook the atoll and the house. Almost in a \\npanic the company started for the door. In the dim light their sweaty faces \\nappeared ghastly. Isaacs panted asthmatically in the suffocating heat. \\n \\n\"What\\'s your haste?\" Parlay chuckled and girded at his departing guests. \"A last \\ndrink, brave gentlemen.\" No one noticed him. As they took the shell-bordered \\npath to the beach he stuck his head out the door and called, \"Don\\'t forget, \\ngentlemen, at ten to-morrow old Parlay sells his pearls.\" \\n \\nIII \\n \\nOn the beach a curious scene took place. Whaleboat after whaleboat was being \\nhurriedly manned and shoved off. It had grown still darker. The stagnant calm \\ncontinued, and the sand shook under their feet with each buffet of the sea on the \\nouter shore. Narii Herring walked leisurely along the sand. He grinned at the very \\nevident haste of the captains and buyers. With him were three of his Kanakas, \\nand also Tai-Hotauri. \\n \\n\"Get into the boat and take an oar,\" Captain Warfield ordered the latter. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n141 \\nTai-Hotauri came over jauntily, while Narii Herring and his three Kanakas paused \\nand looked on from forty feet away. \\n \\n\"I work no more for you, skipper,\" Tai-Hotauri said insolently and loudly. But his \\nface belied his words, for he was guilty of a prodigious wink. \"Fire me, skipper,\" \\nhe huskily whispered, with a second significant wink. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield took the cue and proceeded to do some acting himself. He raised \\nhis fist and his voice. \\n \\n\"Get into that boat,\" he thundered, \"or I\\'ll knock seven bells out of you!\" \\n \\nThe Kanaka drew back truculently, and Grief stepped between to placate his \\ncaptain. \\n \\n\"I go to work on the Nuhiva,\" Tai-Hotauri said, rejoining the other group. \\n \\n\"Come back here!\" the captain threatened. \\n \\n\"He\\'s a free man, skipper,\" Narii Herring spoke up. \"He\\'s sailed with me in the \\npast, and he\\'s sailing again, that\\'s all.\" \\n \\n\"Come on, we must get on board,\" Grief urged. \"Look how dark it\\'s getting.\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield gave in, but as the boat shoved off he stood up in the \\nsternsheets and shook his fist ashore. \\n \\n\"I\\'ll settle with you yet, Narii,\" he cried. \"You\\'re the only skipper in the group that \\nsteals other men\\'s sailors,\" He sat down, and in lowered voice queried: \"Now \\nwhat\\'s Tai-Hotauri up to? He\\'s on to something, but what is it?\" \\n \\nIV \\n \\nAs the boat came alongside the Malahini, Hermann\\'s anxious face greeted them \\nover the rail. \\n \\n\"Bottom out fall from barometer,\" he announced. \"She\\'s goin\\' to blow. I got \\nstarboard anchor overhaul.\" \\n \\n\"Overhaul the big one, too,\" Captain Warfield ordered, taking charge. \"And here, \\nsome of you, hoist in this boat. Lower her down to the deck and lash her bottom \\nup.\" \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n142 \\nMen were busy at work on the decks of all the schooners. There was a great \\nclanking of chains being overhauled, and now one craft, and now another, hove \\nin, veered, and dropped a second anchor. Like the Malahini, those that had third \\nanchors were preparing to drop them when the wind showed what quarter it was \\nto blow from. \\n \\nThe roar of the big surf continually grew though the lagoon lay in the mirror-like \\ncalm. \\n \\nThere was no sign of life where Parlay\\'s big house perched on the sand. Boat and \\ncopra-sheds and the sheds where the shell was stored were deserted. \\n \\n\"For two cents I\\'d up anchors and get out,\" Grief said. \"I\\'d do it anyway if it were \\nopen sea. But those chains of atolls to the north and east have us pocketed. \\nWe\\'ve a better chance right here. What do you think, Captain Warfield?\" \\n \\n\"I agree with you, though a lagoon is no mill-pond for riding it out. I wonder \\nwhere she\\'s going to start from? Hello! There goes one of Parlay\\'s copra-sheds.\" \\n \\nThey could see the grass-thatched shed lift and collapse, while a froth of foam \\ncleared the crest of the sand and ran down to the lagoon. \\n \\n\"Breached across!\" Mulhall exclaimed. \"That\\'s something for a starter. There she \\ncomes again!\" \\n \\nThe wreck of the shed was now flung up and left on the sand-crest, A third wave \\nbuffeted it into fragments which washed down the slope toward the lagoon. \\n \\n\"If she blow I would as be cooler yet,\" Hermann grunted. \"No longer can I breathe. \\nIt is damn hot. I am dry like a stove.\" \\n \\nHe chopped open a drinking cocoanut with his heavy sheath-knife and drained \\nthe contents. The rest of them followed his example, pausing once to watch one of \\nParlay\\'s shell sheds go down in ruin. The barometer now registered 29:50. \\n \\n\"Must be pretty close to the centre of the area of low pressure,\" Grief remarked \\ncheerfully. \"I was never through the eye of a hurricane before. It will be an \\nexperience for you, too, Mulhall. From the speed the barometer\\'s dropped, it\\'s \\ngoing to be a big one.\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield groaned, and all eyes drew to him. He was looking through the \\nglasses down the length of the lagoon to the southeast. \\n \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n143 \\n\"There she comes,\" he said quietly. \\n \\nThey did not need glasses to see. A flying film, strangely marked, seemed drawing \\nover the surface of the lagoon. Abreast of it, along the atoll, travelling with equal \\nspeed, was a stiff bending of the cocoanut palms and a blur of flying leaves. The \\nfront of the wind on the water was a solid, sharply defined strip of dark-coloured, \\nwind-vexed water. In advance of this strip, like skirmishers, were flashes of \\nwindflaws. Behind this strip, a quarter of a mile in width, was a strip of what \\nseemed glassy calm. Next came another dark strip of wind, and behind that the \\nlagoon was all crisping, boiling whiteness. \\n \\n\"What is that calm streak?\" Mulhall asked. \\n \\n\"Calm,\" Warfield answered. \\n \\n\"But it travels as fast as the wind,\" was the other\\'s objection. \\n \\n\"It has to, or it would be overtaken and it wouldn\\'t be any calm. It\\'s a double-\\nheader, I saw a big squall like that off Savaii once. A regular double-header. \\nSmash! it hit us, then it lulled to nothing, and smashed us a second time. Stand \\nby and hold on! Here she is on top of us. Look at the Roberta!\" \\n \\nThe Roberta, lying nearest to the wind at slack chains, was swept off broadside \\nlike a straw. Then her chains brought her up, bow on to the wind, with an \\nastonishing jerk. Schooner after schooner, the Malahini with them, was now \\nsweeping away with the first gust and fetching up on taut chains. Mulhall and \\nseveral of the Kanakas were taken off their feet when the Malahini jerked to her \\nanchors. \\n \\nAnd then there was no wind. The flying calm streak had reached them. Grief \\nlighted a match, and the unshielded flame burned without flickering in the still \\nair. A very dim twilight prevailed. The cloud-sky, lowering as it had been for \\nhours, seemed now to have descended quite down upon the sea. \\n \\nThe Roberta tightened to her chains when the second head of the hurricane hit, \\nas did schooner after schooner in swift succession. The sea, white with fury, \\nboiled in tiny, spitting wavelets. The deck of the Malahini vibrated under the \\nmen\\'s feet. The taut-stretched halyards beat a tattoo against the masts, and all \\nthe rigging, as if smote by some mighty hand, set up a wild thrumming. It was \\nimpossible to face the wind and breathe. Mulhall, crouching with the others \\nbehind the shelter of the cabin, discovered this, and his lungs were filled in an \\ninstant with so great a volume of driven air which he could not expel that he \\nnearly strangled ere he could turn his head away. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n144 \\n \\n\"It\\'s incredible,\" he gasped, but no one heard him. \\n \\nHermann and several Kanakas were crawling for\\'ard on hands and knees to let go \\nthe third anchor. Grief touched Captain Warfield and pointed to the Roberta. She \\nwas dragging down upon them. Warfield put his mouth to Grief\\'s ear and \\nshouted: \\n \\n\"We\\'re dragging, too!\" \\n \\nGrief sprang to the wheel and put it hard over, veering the Mahhini to port. The \\nthird anchor took hold, and the Roberta went by, stern-first, a dozen yards away. \\nThey waved their hands to Peter Gee and Captain Robinson, who, with a number \\nof sailors, were at work on the bow. \\n \\n\"He\\'s knocking out the shackles!\" Grief shouted. \"Going to chance the passage! \\nGot to! Anchors skating!\" \\n \\n\"We\\'re holding now!\" came the answering shout. \"There goes the Cactus down on \\nthe Misi. That settles them!\" \\n \\nThe Misi had been holding, but the added windage of the Cactus was too much, \\nand the entangled schooners slid away across the boiling white. Their men could \\nbe seen chopping and fighting to get them apart. The Roberta, cleared of her \\nanchors, with a patch of tarpaulin set for\\'ard, was heading for the passage at the \\nnorthwestern end of the lagoon. They saw her make it and drive out to sea. But \\nthe Misi and Cactus, unable to get clear of each other, went ashore on the atoll \\nhalf a mile from the passage. The wind merely increased on itself and continued \\nto increase. To face the full blast of it required all one\\'s strength, and several \\nminutes of crawling on deck against it tired a man to exhaustion. Hermann, with \\nhis Kanakas, plodded steadily, lashing and making secure, putting ever more \\ngaskets on the sails. The wind ripped and tore their thin undershirts from their \\nbacks. They moved slowly, as if their bodies weighed tons, never releasing a \\nhand-hold until another had been secured. Loose ends of rope stood out stiffly \\nhorizontal, and, when a whipping gave, the loose end frazzled and blew away. \\n \\nMulhall touched one and then another and pointed to the shore. The grass-sheds \\nhad disappeared, and Parlay\\'s house rocked drunkenly, Because the wind blew \\nlengthwise along the atoll, the house had been sheltered by the miles of cocoanut \\ntrees. But the big seas, breaking across from outside, were undermining it and \\nhammering it to pieces. Already tilted down the slope of sand, its end was \\nimminent. Here and there in the cocoanut trees people had lashed themselves. \\nThe trees did not sway or thresh about. Bent over rigidly from the wind, they \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n145 \\nremained in that position and vibrated monstrously. Underneath, across the \\nsand, surged the white spume of the breakers. A big sea was likewise making \\ndown the length of the lagoon. It had plenty of room to kick up in the ten-mile \\nstretch from the windward rim of the atoll, and all the schooners were bucking \\nand plunging into it. The Malahini had begun shoving her bow and fo\\'c\\'sle head \\nunder the bigger ones, and at times her waist was filled rail-high with water. \\n \\n\"Now\\'s the time for your engine!\" Grief bellowed; and Captain Warfield, crawling \\nover to where the engineer lay, shouted emphatic commands. \\n \\nUnder the engine, going full speed ahead, the Malahini behaved better. While she \\ncontinued to ship seas over her bow, she was not jerked down so fiercely by her \\nanchors. On the other hand, she was unable to get any slack in the chains. The \\nbest her forty horsepower could do was to ease the strain. \\n \\nStill the wind increased. The little Nuhiva, lying abreast of the Malahini and \\ncloser in to the beach, her engine still unrepaired and her captain ashore, was \\nhaving a bad time of it. She buried herself so frequently and so deeply that they \\nwondered each time if she could clear herself of the water. At three in the \\nafternoon buried by a second sea before she could free herself of the preceding \\none, she did not come up. \\n \\nMulhall looked at Grief. \\n \\n\"Burst in her hatches,\" was the bellowed answer. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield pointed to the Winifred, a little schooner plunging and burying \\noutside of them, and shouted in Grief\\'s ear. His voice came in patches of dim \\nwords, with intervals of silence when whisked away by the roaring wind. \\n \\n\"Rotten little tub... Anchors hold... But how she holds together... Old as the ark---\\n-\" \\n \\nAn hour later Hermann pointed to her. Her for\\'ard bitts, foremast, and most of \\nher bow were gone, having been jerked out of her by her anchors. She swung \\nbroadside, rolling in the trough and settling by the head, and in this plight was \\nswept away to leeward. \\n \\nFive vessels now remained, and of them the Malahini was the only one with an \\nengine. Fearing either the Nuhiva\\'s or the Winifdred\\'s fate, two of them followed \\nthe Roberta\\'s example, knocking out the chain-shackles and running for the \\npassage. The Dolly was the first, but her tarpaulin was carried away, and she \\nwent to destruction on the lee-rim of the atoll near the Misi and the Cactus. \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n146 \\nUndeterred by this, the Moana let go and followed with the same result. \\n \\n\"Pretty good engine that, eh?\" Captain Warfield yelled to his owner. \\n \\nGrief put out his hand and shook. \"She\\'s paying for herself!\" he yelled back. \"The \\nwind\\'s shifting around to the southward, and we ought to lie easier!\" \\n \\nSlowly and steadily, but with ever-increasing velocity, the wind veered around to \\nthe south and the southwest, till the three schooners that were left pointed \\ndirectly in toward the beach. The wreck of Parlay\\'s house was picked up, hurled \\ninto the lagoon, and blown out upon them. Passing the Malahini, it crashed into \\nthe Papara, lying a quarter of a mile astern. There was wild work for\\'ard on her, \\nand in a quarter of an hour the house went clear, but it had taken the Papara\\'s \\nforemast and bowsprit with it. \\n \\nInshore, on their port bow, lay the Tahaa, slim and yacht-like, but excessively \\noversparred. Her anchors still held, but her captain, finding no abatement in the \\nwind, proceeded to reduce windage by chopping down his masts. \\n \\n\"Pretty good engine that,\" Grief congratulated his skipper, \"It will save our sticks \\nfor us yet.\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield shook his head dubiously. \\n \\nThe sea on the lagoon went swiftly down with the change of wind, but they were \\nbeginning to feel the heave and lift of the outer sea breaking across the atoll. \\nThere were not so many trees remaining. Some had been broken short off, others \\nuprooted. One tree they saw snap off halfway up, three persons clinging to it, and \\nwhirl away by the wind into the lagoon. Two detached themselves from it and \\nswam to the Tahaa. Not long after, just before darkness, they saw one jump \\noverboard from that schooner\\'s stern and strike out strongly for the Malahini \\nthrough the white, spitting wavelets. \\n \\n\"It\\'s Tai-Hotauri,\" was Grief\\'s judgment. \"Now we\\'ll have the news.\" \\n \\nThe Kanaka caught the bobstay, climbed over the bow, and crawled aft. Time was \\ngiven him to breathe, and then, behind the part shelter of the cabin, in broken \\nsnatches and largely by signs, he told his story. \\n \\n\"Narii... damn robber... He want steal... pearls... Kill Parlay... One man kill \\nParlay... No man know what man... Three Kanakas, Narii, me... Five beans... \\nhat... Narii say one bean black... Nobody know... Kill Parlay... Narii damn liar... \\nAll beans black... Five black... Copra-shed dark... Every man get black bean... Big \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n147 \\nwind come... No chance... Everybody get up tree... No good luck them pearls... I \\ntell you before... No good luck.\" \\n \\n\"Where\\'s Parlay?\" Grief shouted. \\n \\n\"Up tree... Three of his Kanakas same tree. Narii and one Kanaka\\'nother tree... \\nMy tree blow to hell, then I come on board.\" \\n \\n\"Where\\'s the pearls?\" \\n \\n\"Up tree along Parlay. Mebbe Narii get them pearl yet.\" \\n \\nIn the ear of one after another Grief passed on Tai-Hotauri\\'s story. Captain \\nWarfield was particularly incensed, and they could see him grinding his teeth. \\n \\nHermann went below and returned with a riding light, but the moment it was \\nlifted above the level of the cabin wall the wind blew it out. He had better success \\nwith the binnacle lamp, which was lighted only after many collective attempts. \\n \\n\"A fine night of wind!\" Grief yelled in Mulhall\\'s ear. \"And blowing harder all the \\ntime.\" \\n \\n\"How hard?\" \\n \\n\"A hundred miles an hour... two hundred... I don\\'t know... Harder than I\\'ve ever \\nseen it.\" \\n \\nThe lagoon grew more and more troubled by the sea that swept across the atoll. \\nHundreds of leagues of ocean was being backed up by the hurricane, which more \\nthan overcame the lowering effect of the ebb tide. Immediately the tide began to \\nrise the increase in the size of the seas was noticeable. Moon and wind were \\nheaping the South Pacific on Hikihoho atoll. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield returned from one of his periodical trips to the engine room with \\nthe word that the engineer lay in a faint. \\n \\n\"Can\\'t let that engine stop!\" he concluded helplessly. \\n \\n\"All right!\" Grief said, \"Bring him on deck. I\\'ll spell him.\" \\n \\nThe hatch to the engine room was battened down, access being gained through a \\nnarrow passage from the cabin. The heat and gas fumes were stifling. Grief took \\none hasty, comprehensive examination of the engine and the fittings of the tiny \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n148 \\nroom, then blew out the oil-lamp. After that he worked in darkness, save for the \\nglow from endless cigars which he went into the cabin to light. Even-tempered as \\nhe was, he soon began to give evidences of the strain of being pent in with a \\nmechanical monster that toiled, and sobbed, and slubbered in the shouting dark. \\nNaked to the waist, covered with grease and oil, bruised and skinned from being \\nknocked about by the plunging, jumping vessel, his head swimming from the \\nmixture of gas and air he was compelled to breathe, he laboured on hour after \\nhour, in turns petting, blessing, nursing, and cursing the engine and all its parts. \\nThe ignition began to go bad. The feed grew worse. And worst of all, the cylinders \\nbegan to heat. In a consultation held in the cabin the half-caste engineer begged \\nand pleaded to stop the engine for half an hour in order to cool it and to attend to \\nthe water circulation. Captain Warfield was against any stopping. The half-caste \\nswore that the engine would ruin itself and stop anyway and for good. Grief, with \\nglaring eyes, greasy and battered, yelled and cursed them both down and issued \\ncommands. Mulhall, the supercargo, and Hermann were set to work in the cabin \\nat double-straining and triple-straining the gasoline. A hole was chopped through \\nthe engine room floor, and a Kanaka heaved bilge-water over the cylinders, while \\nGrief continued to souse running parts in oil. \\n \\n\"Didn\\'t know you were a gasoline expert,\" Captain Warfield admired when Grief \\ncame into the cabin to catch a breath of little less impure air. \\n \\n\"I bathe in gasoline,\" he grated savagely through his teeth. \"I eat it.\" \\n \\nWhat other uses he might have found for it were never given, for at that moment \\nall the men in the cabin, as well as the gasoline being strained, were smashed \\nforward against the bulkhead as the Malahini took an abrupt, deep dive. For the \\nspace of several minutes, unable to gain their feet, they rolled back and forth and \\npounded and hammered from wall to wall. The schooner, swept by three big seas, \\ncreaked and groaned and quivered, and from the weight of water on her decks \\nbehaved logily. Grief crept to the engine, while Captain Warfield waited his \\nchance to get through the companion-way and out on deck. \\n \\nIt was half an hour before he came back. \\n \\n\"Whaleboat\\'s gone!\" he reported. \"Galley\\'s gone! Everything gone except the deck \\nand hatches! And if that engine hadn\\'t been going we\\'d be gone! Keep up the good \\nwork!\" \\n \\nBy midnight the engineer\\'s lungs and head had been sufficiently cleared of gas \\nfumes to let him relieve Grief, who went on deck to get his own head and lungs \\nclear. He joined the others, who crouched behind the cabin, holding on with their \\nhands and made doubly secure by rope-lashings. It was a complicated huddle, for \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n149 \\nit was the only place of refuge for the Kanakas. Some of them had accepted the \\nskipper\\'s invitation into the cabin but had been driven out by the fumes. The \\nMalahini was being plunged down and swept frequently, and what they breathed \\nwas air and spray and water commingled. \\n \\n\"Making heavy weather of it, Mulhall!\" Grief shouted to his guest between \\nimmersions. \\n \\nMulhall, strangling and choking, could only nod. The scuppers could not carry off \\nthe burden of water on the schooner\\'s deck. She rolled it out and took it in over \\none rail and the other; and at times, nose thrown skyward, sitting down on her \\nheel, she avalanched it aft. It surged along the poop gangways, poured over the \\ntop of the cabin, submerging and bruising those that clung on, and went out over \\nthe stern-rail. \\n \\nMulhall saw him first, and drew Grief\\'s attention. It was Narii Herring, crouching \\nand holding on where the dim binnacle light shone upon him. He was quite \\nnaked, save for a belt and a bare-bladed knife thrust between it and the skin. \\n \\nCaptain Warfield untied his lashings and made his way over the bodies of the \\nothers. When his face became visible in the light from the binnacle it was working \\nwith anger. They could see him speak, but the wind tore the sound away. He \\nwould not put his lips to Narii\\'s ear. Instead, he pointed over the side. Narii \\nHerring understood. His white teeth showed in an amused and sneering smile, \\nand he stood up, a magnificent figure of a man. \\n \\n\"It\\'s murder!\" Mulhall yelled to Grief. \\n \\n\"He\\'d have murdered Old Parlay!\" Grief yelled back. \\n \\nFor the moment the poop was clear of water and the Malahini on an even keel. \\nNarii made a bravado attempt to walk to the rail, but was flung down by the \\nwind. Thereafter he crawled, disappearing in the darkness, though there was \\ncertitude in all of them that he had gone over the side. The Malahini dived deep, \\nand when they emerged from the flood that swept aft, Grief got Mulhall\\'s ear. \\n \\n\"Can\\'t lose him! He\\'s the Fish Man of Tahiti! He\\'ll cross the lagoon and land on \\nthe other rim of the atoll if there\\'s any atoll left!\" \\n \\nFive minutes afterward, in another submergence, a mess of bodies poured down \\non them over the top of the cabin. These they seized and held till the water \\ncleared, when they carried them below and learned their identity. Old Parlay lay \\noh his back on the floor, with closed eyes and without movement. The other two \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n150 \\nwere his Kanaka cousins. All three were naked and bloody. The arm of one \\nKanaka hung helpless and broken at his side. The other man bled freely from a \\nhideous scalp wound. \\n \\n\"Narii did that?\" Mulhall demanded. \\n \\nGrief shook his head. \"No; it\\'s from being smashed along the deck and over the \\nhouse!\" \\n \\nSomething suddenly ceased, leaving them in dizzying uncertainty. For the \\nmoment it was hard to realize there was no wind. With the absolute abruptness of \\na sword slash, the wind had been chopped off. The schooner rolled and plunged, \\nfetching up on her anchors with a crash which for the first time they could hear. \\nAlso, for the first time they could hear the water washing about on deck. The \\nengineer threw off the propeller and eased the engine down. \\n \\n\"We\\'re in the dead centre,\" Grief said. \"Now for the shift. It will come as hard as \\never.\" He looked at the barometer. \"29:32,\" he read. \\n \\nNot in a moment could he tone down the voice which for hours had battled \\nagainst the wind, and so loudly did he speak that in the quiet it hurt the others\\' \\nears. \\n \\n\"All his ribs are smashed,\" the supercargo said, feeling along Parlay\\'s side. \"He\\'s \\nstill breathing, but he\\'s a goner.\" \\n \\nOld Parlay groaned, moved one arm impotently, and opened his eyes. In them \\nwas the light of recognition. \\n \\n\"My brave gentlemen,\" he whispered haltingly. \"Don\\'t forget... the auction... at ten \\no\\'clock... in hell.\" \\n \\nHis eyes dropped shut and the lower jaw threatened to drop, but he mastered the \\nqualms of dissolution long enough to omit one final, loud, derisive cackle. \\n \\nAbove and below pandemonium broke out. \\n \\nThe old familiar roar of the wind was with them. The Malahini, caught broadside, \\nwas pressed down almost on her beam ends as she swung the arc compelled by \\nher anchors. They rounded her into the wind, where she jerked to an even keel. \\nThe propeller was thrown on, and the engine took up its work again. \\n \\n\"Northwest!\" Captain Warfield shouted to Grief when he came on deck. \"Hauled \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n151 \\neight points like a shot!\" \\n \\n\"Narii\\'ll never get across the lagoon now!\" Grief observed. \\n \\n\"Then he\\'ll blow back to our side, worse luck!\" \\n \\n \\n \\n V \\n \\nAfter the passing of the centre the barometer began to rise. Equally rapid was the \\nfall of the wind. When it was no more than a howling gale, the engine lifted up in \\nthe air, parted its bed-plates with a last convulsive effort of its forty horsepower, \\nand lay down on its side. A wash of water from the bilge sizzled over it and the \\nsteam arose in clouds. The engineer wailed his dismay, but Grief glanced over the \\nwreck affectionately and went into the cabin to swab the grease off his chest and \\narms with bunches of cotton waste. \\n \\nThe sun was up and the gentlest of summer breezes blowing when he came on \\ndeck, after sewing up the scalp of one Kanaka and setting the other\\'s arm. The \\nMalahini lay close in to the beach. For\\'ard, Hermann and the crew were heaving \\nin and straightening out the tangle of anchors. The Papara and the Tahaa were \\ngone, and Captain Warfield, through the glasses, was searching the opposite rim \\nof the atoll. \\n \\n\"Not a stick left of them,\" he said. \"That\\'s what comes of not having engines. They \\nmust have dragged across before the big shift came.\" \\n \\nAshore, where Parlay\\'s house had been, was no vestige of any house. For the \\nspace of three hundred yards, where the sea had breached, no tree or even stump \\nwas left. Here and there, farther along, stood an occasional palm, and there were \\nnumbers which had been snapped off above the ground. In the crown of one \\nsurviving palm Tai-Hotauri asserted he saw something move. There were no boats \\nleft to the Malahini, and they watched him swim ashore and climb the tree. \\n \\nWhen he came back, they helped over the rail a young native girl of Parley\\'s \\nhousehold. But first she passed up to them a battered basket. In it was a litter of \\nblind kittens--all dead save one, that feebly mewed and staggered on awkward \\nlegs. \\n \\n\"Hello!\" said Mulhall. \"Who\\'s that?\" \\n \\nAlong the beach they saw a man walking. He moved casually, as if out for a \\n', 'www.freeclassicebooks.com \\n152 \\nmorning stroll. Captain Warfield gritted his teeth. It was Narii Herring. \\n \\n\"Hello, skipper!\" Narii called, when he was abreast of them. \"Can I come aboard \\nand get some breakfast?\" \\n \\nCaptain Warfield\\'s face and neck began to swell and turn purple. He tried to \\nspeak, but choked. \\n \\n\"For two cents--for two cents----\" was all he could manage to articulate. \\n \\nTHE END  \\nwww.freeclassicebooks.com \\n']\n",
