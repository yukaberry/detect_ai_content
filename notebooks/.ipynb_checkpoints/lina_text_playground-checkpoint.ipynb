    "- **Class 0** (Human-written): 1375 samples (99.78%)\n",

    "This imbalance poses a significant challenge for training a robust and unbiased machine learning model. With such a disproportionate ratio, the model is likely to become biased towards predicting the majority class (human-written), as it has very few instances of the minority class (AI-generated) to learn from.\n",

    "Given the extreme imbalance in the dataset, we will explore other datasets that have a more balanced distribution of AI-generated and human-written texts. This will allow us to train a more effective and generalized model capable of accurately distinguishing between human and AI-generated content."
