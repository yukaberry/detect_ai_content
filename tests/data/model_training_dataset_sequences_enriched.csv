Writing SOL

Where is one place you would like to visit?

I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather.

Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida.

The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year

To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida.

My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground.

He is special to me because if it was'nt for him I would not be playing soccer right now.

Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him.

I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me.

I will take off this chain the day I die.

I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer.

The college that I'm going to is Generic_School.

The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age.

Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect.

If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it.

If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation.

The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me.

Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.

The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.

Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.

When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.

I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.

After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.

That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.

My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.

My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.

All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.

When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.

He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.

When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.

When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.

In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.

This why I play soccer just because of him.

Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.

He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.

Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:

Family and my grandfather grave.

I would like to go to Generic_City studios.

Go to the beach and get some nice weather.

27,"Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, that's why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem.

Some people believe in praising a student's to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the student's best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention.

Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while they're doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldn't do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has.

First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they don't, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they don't.

In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us what's to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, we'll not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because we'd already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove we're good on something, it's completetly wrong, you don't have to get an achievement to prove you're good on something you like it or enjoy to do.

The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because you're waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself.

The first step that I say that nobody choose our own character is because when we are sad nobody can change our attitude or own character somebody can try to help us but they don't gonna change our attitude because when we are sad sometimes we are angry, and our character is so bad that we don't want to do anything we just want to be alone or we just need to take a brake because maybe we are stress.",0,12,-0.10714285714285712,0.3092592592592593,2,937

The last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character

Nobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile..",0,20,0.0,0.21939393939393945,10,1969

there for is a bit concerning about how kids change there characters just because they dont fell good about them selves and have a lot of thinking inside of them the traits that you carry will have a dominance over them but i dont think that its best answering the question there for do actually they take control beyond our control.

There for it will be not always the case between how other view your things and traits makes you in insecure how other people see you and you change to make your self better than our parents gave us something we just got it from society like there is a lot of influences in the internet and more things that can go far behind the imaginable and they are not controlled by anyone they are just more likely to have more influences beyond there control but there is a lot of influences in this world you just got to find the right one for you and stick with it general likely there is more change in society for different perspectives.

Secondly there is a possible out come that you everyone can get out of this, just like other people that change there perspective at looking at things there for i should say that i have changed a lot since i got here in Virginia and am adapting to being normal well the normal way of being normal for other people there are influences beyond our control because what you see on the internet you will want to mimic it one day like there is a lot of rapers talking about 'girls, god there is a it of are influences in our daily lives always hearing what a rapper did or what type of things he is going to do there for its a bit concerning about all that because for a person that just moved here is a lot of change there is a lot of people that influence almost all the world in California there is where i lived all the artist and musical players and all of them have a purpose of having more people being influenced by them and making a lot of money if they get a lot of attention from a lot of people.

There is kids just like adults that get influence by others there is a possibility that we choose our own ideas of being influenced that are out of our control we choose to be this way we choose our path always they follow what we want there for i am proud of the world we live in.

There is a posibility that new things come out every year new things that 'kill' us or maybe other things like war and most of the things happening to our world and more polution and more virus that want to kill us and it is being more influenced by others to be scared of it becasuse you could die from that there is a lot of thinnking behind every smart influences.

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is.

Also,

having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind person's life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

25,"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else.

no body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework.

In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people)

they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do )

to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue.

and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter.

In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it.
