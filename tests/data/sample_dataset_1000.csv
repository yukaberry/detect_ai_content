969602,"These volunteer experiences have taught me invaluable lessons in time management, multitasking, and problem-solving. 
When employers are looking for potential employees, they often look for qualities associated with responsibility and hard work. I have always strived to be a responsible person, and I have several examples of how I have accomplished this. By showing employers how responsible I am with my own work, I can prove that I can be trusted and that I value hard work.

In addition, I have also gained valuable experience through volunteering in various positions. A hard-worker will also be seen as a reliable and trustworthy individual, characteristics that can make them highly desirable to employers.. For example, I always complete my tasks accurately and thoroughly, and I try to stay organized by using to-do lists and project timelines. Through developing these skills, I have been able to increase my efficiency so I can complete tasks quickly and effectively.

Finally, it's easy to take for granted how important it is to be a hard-worker as opposed to a lazy one. A lazy person may appear unmotivated and may take shortcuts on work, while a hard-worker will go the extra mile",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
38824," Online learning and traditional classroom education are two distinct approaches to acquiring knowledge and skills. While online learning has gained popularity in recent years, there are several reasons why attending school in a traditional classroom setting is still the best option for students.

First and foremost, attending school provides students with the opportunity to develop important interpersonal skills. By interacting with peers and teachers on a daily basis, students learn how to communicate effectively, collaborate with others, and build relationships. These skills are essential for success in both academic and professional settings. In contrast, online learning can be isolating, as students may feel disconnected from their peers and teachers. This can make it difficult for them to develop the social skills they need to succeed in the long term.

Secondly, attending school allows students to receive immediate feedback and support from their teachers. In a classroom setting, teachers can provide real-time feedback on assignments and assessments, helping students to identify areas where they need to improve and providing guidance on how to do so. This level of personalized support is not possible with online learning, where students may have to wait for feedback or rely on automated grading systems.

Furthermore, attending school provides students with a structured learning environment that is conducive to focused study. In a classroom, students are required to attend lectures, participate in discussions, and complete assignments on a specific schedule. This structure helps to keep students on track and ensures that they are making progress towards their goals. In contrast, online learning can be more flexible, which can be both a strength and a weakness. While it allows students to study at their own pace, it can also lead to procrastination and a lack of structure.

Lastly, attending school provides students with the opportunity to participate in extracurricular activities and events. These activities can range from sports and music to clubs and volunteer organizations. Participation in these activities can help students to develop new skills, build their resume, and make connections with like-minded individuals. Online learning does not offer the same level of extracurricular opportunities, which can limit students' ability to develop well-rounded skills and experiences.

In conclusion, while online learning has its advantages, attending school in a traditional classroom setting is still the best option for students. Attending school provides students with the opportunity to develop important interpersonal skills, receive immediate feedback and support from their teachers, study in",,1.0

With classes, social activities, and even just finding time for yourself all vying for your attention, it can be difficult to juggle everything at once. Although the process of learning how to manage these competing demands is not easy, making adjustments along the way will help you get through each semester with success and confidence. The first step toward managing stress levels during college is to create a daily schedule that allows enough time for attending classes as well as studying and completing assignments on time. To do this effectively, consider writing down all upcoming due dates in one place so that there are no surprises when they come up; this will also help you plan out when you should start working on particular tasks ahead of their deadlines in order to have enough time to complete them properly. Additionally, setting aside dedicated blocks of “free” or “me” time every day where no work-related obligations occupy your thoughts can give you an opportunity for relaxation which is essential for succeeding both academically and personally throughout the semester. In addition to creating a structured daily routine, prioritizing self-care during college is vital in order maintain productivity levels while decreasing stress significantly over long periods of time. Finding ways such as going for walks around campus or participating in physical activities like running or yoga can benefit both mental health and physical wellbeing; getting outside into natural surroundings has been proven by many studies to reduce anxiety symptoms dramatically over short amounts of period spent doing so regularly – even if it’s only fifteen minutes per day! Making sure that there are plenty of nutrient dense food choices available during meals (and avoiding processed/junk foods) will provide energy needed throughout the hours spent studying instead of crashing after eating snacks filled with sugar or additives frequently found within convenience items sold at stores near campus locations too!

Second chances are also very important with impressions. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job.

In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. You will forgive and forget. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. Your first impression or somebody else's first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself.

I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory.

I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.. First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. Over a period of time if let's say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity.

But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they don't pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and that's why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"". If you have a positive attitude that can make you a better person or successful for yourself and other people.. If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person.

Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people don't do it . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you.

Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons.

Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it ",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Finally i will expain how to take decisons, and to make them work. you can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else.

In summary we all have the decision to select which way to follow. As the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. In this essay i will talk about some ways the we can work together. Second i will explain about society, and how can be relative to be not a individual person. This can be a result the Ralp Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, beacuse you change that and be what you want to be.. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. Many companies work together as a team to get there goels, you can work with other people in your job as a company.

Some people prefert to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. There another people the doesn't like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by there own. As i went throught about job and result. Some them beacuse they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good.

We all make decisions in life but some those decisons can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. This may prove that individuality doesn't change the you can not be, what you want be.

There are many ways the can be a ocation of individuality. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. The president can deciside to work alone, and make the things as he wants but he knows the he needs to work together, we the people in the congress beacuse by himself can not do everything. They like to be the one the everyone see, the point of attention these people we can call as indiviluatys. Another occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. Is not just to be individual is to know how to management your life in your time. Be around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or somethings these people chage. You can try to work with the person, is not just be a individual person, beause you might need the help of the person one day. Prompt

You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life.

948995,"And it's a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused.

Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you don't understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they won't lose points and grades.

On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you won't receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they won't be confused or fail the class.

In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, that's why I'm base with school programs.. Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didn't go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works.

If a student wasn't available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they haven't done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

46954,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is a groundbreaking technology that enables computers to detect and analyze human emotions. According to the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" this technology has the potential to revolutionize various fields, including education. However, the idea of using FACS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom raises several concerns. In this essay, I will argue that the use of this technology in educational settings is not valuable and may even be harmful.

Firstly, the FACS system is not foolproof, and its accuracy may be affected by various factors, such as lighting conditions, facial expressions, and cultural differences. According to Nick D'Alto, a technology expert, the human brain can already perform complex emotional calculations, and FACS may not be able to accurately detect emotions in all students. This means that FACS may wrongly identify a student's emotional state, leading to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. For example, a student who is naturally reserved or introverted may be mislabeled as bored or disengaged, which could be detrimental to their self-esteem and academic progress.

Secondly, the deployment of FACS in classrooms raises significant privacy concerns. The technology can potentially invade students' personal space and emotional privacy, which could have a negative impact on their mental health and well-being. Students may feel uncomfortable knowing that their emotions are being monitored and analyzed by a computer, leading to increased stress levels and anxiety. Moreover, the FACS system may not be able to understand the underlying causes of students' emotions, which could result in misplaced interventions and a lack of empathy from teachers.

Thirdly, the implementation of FACS in classrooms may not be practical or affordable for many schools. The cost of equipping computers with FACS technology and training teachers to interpret the data could be exorbitant, especially for cash-strapped schools. Moreover, the constant adaptation of teaching methods to meet individual students' needs may disrupt the learning process for other students, leading to a lack of cohesion and consistency in the classroom. This could result in students falling behind or becoming disengaged from the learning process.

Lastly, the use of FACS may undermine the importance of human connection and emotional understanding in education. Teachers are trained to recognize and respond to students' emotions, and this skill is essential for building positive relationships and creating a supportive learning environment. By relying on technology to detect emotions, we may be neglecting the human touch that is so vital in education. Students who struggle with emotional expression or have difficulty interacting with peers may miss out on valuable opportunities to develop social and emotional skills, which could have a lasting impact on their academic and personal success.

In conclusion, while the Facial Action Coding System is an impressive technological advancement, its use in classrooms to read students' emotional expressions is not valuable. The potential inaccuracies, privacy concerns, and financial constraints outweigh the potential benefits, and it may undermine the human connection that is so important in education. Instead, we should focus on supporting and training teachers to recognize and respond to students' emotions in a human-centric approach. By doing so, we can create a more personalized and effective learning environment that promotes academic success and supports students' emotional well-being.",,1.0

In the present times, many people all over the world use their cellular devices either for activity planning, work related tasks, or some time to relax. Phones in this generation are considered an addiction to our lives and is in a way dangerous because of how easily we get distracted on to them even in times when we shouldn't be on them. When driving, all senses and attention is needed because an accident can come at you from anywhere, when you least expect it. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? When you lose focus doing something that requires attention give it full attention with no distractions because you or others could end up getting hurt.

Driving is an action that does indeed require utmost attention when doing it, especially around other people. Distractions will get in the way when driving and ignoring it is the best course of action. Trying to drive can be difficult for some and it's understandable but those who do know how to drive still can cause car accidents do to lack of focus when driving which is why laws to prevent phone usage while driving have been put down and enforced by police to keep others and ourselves safe from car accidents.

Cell phones were created for fast communication and to help us react fast if there was trouble or we were put in dangerous situations to get help as quickly as possible. Over the years, cell phones have evolved to be able to help us in our daily lives. An example would be reminders for occasions, calls from or to work/ video chat calls for face to face meetings if necessary, quick information gathering, and many more uses. The mobile era is riding strong and doesn't look like its gonna fall for awhile with many apps developed that can be downloaded and used on our phones from social media apps to learning ones. The use of phones has changed the lives of many to the best or worst occasions, meaning that phones are good for us only at certain times, not all the time.

The fact of the matter is that phones are useful but can cause harm to us and others like health problems, mental problems, and tear what we call fun. Driving is needed for moving around quickly if your not feeling like taking public transportation to get to your location. Both the cell phone and motor vehicle were made to make our lives easier in the new era, but putting both together can cause issues and hurt yourself and others. Thinking of times without these tools life was a little rough and harder to keep up with, meaning that staying updated on friends and family or trying to get from place to place.

Overall, the people know what's right from wrong and when to do something at the right time. Does texting and driving cause traffic accidents? The blame goes to those who don't abuse the technology of the new generation like bluetooth devices, speakerphones in the car, and smartwatches. The laws that help and try to prevent people from harm do their best, but the people need to contribute to helping each other.

433656,"""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" is an article that discusses a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FBCS). This technology uses a series of codes to identify human emotions based on facial expressions. The article highlights the potential benefits of using this technology in various fields, including education. However, the idea of using FBCS to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom raises some concerns and questions.

On the one hand, FBCS technology can provide valuable insights into students' emotional states, which can help educators tailor their teaching methods to better meet the needs of individual students. For example, if a student is consistently displaying signs of frustration or confusion, the teacher can adjust their approach to make the material more accessible and engaging. Similarly, if a student is consistently displaying signs of boredom or disengagement, the teacher can take steps to reengage the student and keep them motivated.

Furthermore, FBCS technology can also help identify students who may be struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety or depression. By detecting changes in facial expressions over time, educators can intervene early and provide support and resources to help students manage their mental health.

However, there are also concerns about the use of FBCS technology in the classroom. Firstly, the accuracy of the technology is not yet perfect, and there is a risk of misinterpreting facial expressions and making incorrect assumptions about a student's emotional state. Additionally, some students may feel uncomfortable or violated if they know they are being monitored and analyzed in this way.

In conclusion, the use of FBCS technology to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom has both potential benefits and drawbacks. While it may provide valuable insights into students' emotional states and help educators tailor their teaching methods and provide mental health support, it also raises questions about accuracy and student privacy. Ultimately, the decision to use this technology in the classroom should be carefully considered and balanced against the potential risks and benefits. """,,1.0

Graduating at an early age gives students the unique opportunity to explore higher education and the workforce, while also providing valuable time to build real-world experience. Although Zuckerberg made a habit of jumping ahead of his peers, he states that he only considered graduating early after he took Advanced Placement courses during his high school years. 
Graduating high school in three years can provide many opportunities for young students that wouldn't be available in a traditional four year high school program. Furthermore, some high schools may even offer special degree programs that allow students to graduate early while earning college credit or a technical certificate. 

One great example of a successful person who achieved early graduation is Mark Zuckerberg, the co-founder and CEO of Facebook. 

High school graduates also have the option of pursuing special opportunities that open up to them earlier if they don't take the traditional four year route. For instance, many universities offer early admission and scholarships programs to students who choose to apply early. During this gap year, students have the unique opportunity to gain valuable skills, network, and explore new interests, all of which can provide advantages later in life.

In conclusion, graduating high school in three years can provide a variety of benefits and opportunities for young students that may not be available in the traditional four year route. Students that choose to pursue this route can look forward to taking advantage of special programs and resources, furthering their education early, and taking a gap year to explore new interests..

If these rules are enforced then maybe students wont need to tried to slip to use their phone during the school hours. I hope you will see my point in why students should be allowed to use cell phones during free periods.",,0.0

Indeed, setting a good example by one's own behavior can have a tremendous impact on the lives of those around them. Not only will it provide an individual with a sense of accomplishment and self-worth, but it will also lead to an increased sense of mutual respect and understanding with those around them. We can also create a positive environment in which people feel inspired and supported to pursue and strive for success.

When individuals lead by setting a good example, their positive behaviors are bound to rub off on those they interact with, especially those in their immediate network. Not only does it lead to personal growth, but it also encourages a positive attitude and environment in which everyone can thrive and share in a more successful and rewarding outcome.. It not only reflects an individual's personal values and character, but also impacts the surrounding community in powerful ways. As such, it is crucial to strive to maintain a positive demeanor and outlook and lead with integrity and kindness in order to inspire others to do the same.

The potential positive consequences of setting a good example with one's own behavior are numerous. During difficult situations, people will look to those with good habits for guidance. 
Setting a good example by one's own behavior is incredibly important. By setting a good example, we can inspire those around us to become better versions of themselves through a combination of admiration and emulation",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

10454,"In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile,"" the author is decribing how a new technology: the Facial Action Coding System, is enabling computers to identify human emotions. The use of this technology: to read the emotional expressions of students, is not valuable. Even though human have simaliar muscles to show the same emotion each one does vary a great significance.

In paragraph 6 of the article Dr. Huang made a bold prediction ""A classroom computer could reconize when a student is becoming confused or bored,"" This means to him that a students emotions can be completly read by a computer scan. This doesn't seem logical in any means at all. Have you ever watched your classmates facial expression change from confused to them understanding completely in the blink of an eye? Im sure you have. If a computer reads your confused facial emotion in the middle of a lesson right before you understand it, it will change making you have to reset your brain to relearn what you were the the bridge of mastering.

In paragraph 5 a sentence contradicted the article ""Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial trait,"" if this is true then why would an artifical intelegence be able to read emotions better than a human who experiences the similar emotions? A real life example is when someone is really good at looking like they don't care. This is a hard face to read because some people just naturally have it at all times. With a piece of simple technology how would the scan be able to look past the same face with the same emotion at all times? It most likely couldnt and would be uneffectful in the end.

In paragraph 6 another outside of the box thought was put into words from Dr. Huang ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication...So computers need to understand that, too,"" The problem with this is that computers don't understand things, they are programmed to do what they are told. Only alive things ""understand"" which means to learn. If we put a program in our computer to read emotions then the computer will most likely only read that exact facial expression.

The use of technology to read emotional facial expressions of students in a classroom is not valuable because it is to far fetched and unpractical. This is because we have teachers, emotions change constantly, emotions are sometimes hard to read, and computers can't ""understand"" how a human is feeling a all times. Maybe one day a computer will be able to read facial expression, but it will be a waste of time and money.",,1.0

People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. That will help you build up better self-esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what.

In conclusion, there are both positive and negative aspects to consider when contemplating whether or not to change the length of the school day. This could lead to unnecessary stress, as students feel overwhelmed by the amount of work they have to complete in a day. 

On the other hand, a longer school day could mean an overall decrease in the amount of free time students have to themselves. Ultimately, it is important to carefully think through and weigh these different factors in order to make an informed and beneficial decision.. 
When considering the pros and cons of a school day one hour and thirty minutes longer, there are several different points to consider. Additionally, it could also lead to exhaustion, as students can become worn down by having less time to rest and recharge.

The power of imagination has been described as an invaluable tool for navigating the world. It has the potential to expose us to revolutionary ideas that can lead to groundbreaking discoveries. It can create and shape one's perception of reality, while producing seemingly limitless possibilities for the future. This freedom shapes the world we live in, as well as the future generations. Imagination is fluid, without bounds or rules. Imagination allows us to think beyond the limits of our own knowledge, challenging us to explore unknown territories. It provides an expansive view of reality that can lead us to achieving greatness. Knowledge is important and necessary; it is a form of understanding and can be critical for learning. 

In conclusion, imagination is more important than knowledge for many reasons. It gives us the power to explore the seemingly impossible, producing radical ideas and stimulating creative problem-solving.

It can be argued that imagination is essential for progress. 

When comparing imagination to knowledge, imagination takes the lead. But knowledge can often be rigid and restrictive, adhering to traditional ideas with limited potential for growth or innovation.

Texting and driving is something common a lot of people do now a day. There are so many problems with cellphone usage while driving. Many people think it's okay to use their phones while driving, but I personally think it is not okay for people to text and drive. Some people rather risk their life's than to be careful about their surrounding and how one car accident can cause so much damage all because that one person wanted to be on their phone. It doesn't just have to be texting it can be in general by just being on your phone. People get way too distracted by cellphone usage.

Cellphones make a big impact on people, who knew that cellphones can be that addicting. It doesn't matter where you are you turn your head and you see someone on their phone because it is so addicting. It almost like having a coffee addiction. When you see people crossing a cross walk you insatiately see a phone in someone's hands and half of the time there not looking at where there going they just walk and walk until they run into somethings. Cellphones are a huge addiction in today's society for everyone including teenagers. You see cellphones almost everywhere you going. You will be shocked about how many people use their phones a day.

When you're driving and you're on your cellphone is really risky. It can cause many problems as in you cashing into someone else or you can go off the road and get in an accident. There have been many different accidents because people want to be on their phone and not focus on the road. Texting and driving can many deaths as well. People die of being in car accidents when the driver is texting. People don't look on the outside of how many tragic thinks can happen in a blink of an eye. It can be life changing too because you never know what can happen or go wrong. Many people don't know how much damage can happen. People die, vision lost, no arm, no leg, an arm, etc. none of this is replaceable but every material thing can be. That's what people don't understand. People need to be careful of their surroundings and, be careful who you have in the car.

People have habits of looking at their phones once they hear a ring. They right away have to go see what it was or who it was. That's where the distraction comes from and that were people get into trouble with officers or car accidents etc. because they get distracted by the ring of a phone. There is always pros and cons about things people being on the phone. Some of the pros are if you have the sound on it is always good for important in the case of an emergency. You always have something on the side or if someone else calls you and it is an emergency. Some of the cons is that people use it for other purposes which is to text, snapchat, twitter, Instagram etc. and they think they can multi task but some people can't. That's why it's better to put the phone down and let social media wait before there is an accident.

It's better to save your life and some else's.

Being safe is one on the most important things. A text message or video call, snapchat, Instagram is not worth you in bad conditions or you causing a death to yourself or to someone else. Phone are becoming to be more addicting by the day and you would be shocked about how much technology has gone up. Keep all eyes on the road never look down and stay focus.             ",,0.0

A negative effect that can ruin you is like losing friendships or losing a job based on the way you've been acting.

But let me tell you this as a tip so you won't make a mistake and regret it ""think before you speak"", if you don't do that it can lead you to many consequences.. When being honest, people will start trusting you with a lot of things. If you show integrity, people will start looking up to you.

One reason i believe why that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours is because we can conserve more energy for the future, and also too the school should instruct to each student to be careful about the how to consume energy, for example to teach wich focus is the correct for the use in the home and gives tips for that maybe they to pay the least possible bill of light.

Another reason is that i feel that a resource that we can save in the school is the water because all students use almost two time the bathroom and always to take down the pull of the toile, i think the students can make posters in where show the importance about how to save the water and others resources that in the school can save is the plastic and paper because in some places purchase this resources, and with the money the school should to be a better school than others and the students should be more careful about this rescources.

The final reason is that i believe if the school add two hours at the day students and teachers should will have more time for to do more thigs, a thing that the teachers and students will can do is maybe a propaganda, in this propaganda they can show the society how prevent the clime global and to instruct how to be careful with of world, other thing that the students can do is a page online in where to instruct the other students and people out school how make herself have to be careful.

They feel that is the same thing and also too that is more time in the school in addiction that they will spent more money in energy like electricity, ligths , charge to computers ,blackboard electric and the more things, an resource that should spent more is the water because some students when go to the bathroom they forget closed the washstand. Only topic that is frequenthy is debate today is whether or not conserve energy and resouces since some business have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours.

You might remember the facts (how many people were on the ship, what happened when it'sunk, etc.), but you might also remember the concept of the Titanic. This is because the Titanic is a memorable example of something that went wrong. You might also remember the concept of the Titanic because it is a famous example of a disaster.

Another example of why it is important foo students to understand ideas and concepts is that concepts can be applied to new situations. Foo example, let's say that you learn about the solo system. You might remember the facts (the sun, the planets, etc.), but you might also remember the concept of the solo system. This is because the solo system is a collection of objects that orbit around a central object. You might also remember the concept of the solo system because it is a familiar structure.

At the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. 
Growing up, I was entranced by the beautiful sound of the violin—a classical instrument which has been in existence since the 16th century in Europe. I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. I was surrounded by much more experienced and knowledgeable musicians, yet the teacher was patient with me and helped me gradually become more comfortable and confident with the instrument. You need to practice regularly in order to ensure that you can play the instrument comfortably and develop both musical and technical skills such as knowing fingering positions, posture, and having an overall command of the instrument’s sound. 

My first experiences taking violin lessons were humbling. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers.

On the other hand, adopting a four day school week could help reduce the amount of energy needed to transport students, as fewer buses and cars would be necessary. On one hand, extending school days means that a school can do more to conserve energy as they can turn off certain lights or air conditioners earlier each day.

Yoga is even more relaxing then anything else beacuse it helps your mind conitrait and balance its self in order to distress. One, is beacuse the food is great, especially the street food. The best part of Generic_City is the performances beacuse you get to see so many talented people show off there skills with rapping, dancing, and singing. I hope i see you there too. You might even chatch a glipse of your favorite Kpop idol.. Well its time for me to catch a flight to korea. The relaxition spa's are great, to have some ""me time"" they do foot massages, faciaul treatment and more. Once they get the raw meat they cook it have ever they want, in the small grill in the mibble of the table. Last but not least, is the relaxation time i can get for myself. Decent hotels are really hard to find but every single hotel in Korea looks amazing from the inside and from the outside. The beaches in Korea are a great place for families to have bonding time together, especially in Busan.

Finally, the best part is ""me time"" which means I can get time for myself. Korean BBQ'S is where everyone sits down at a table order some raw meat, they also get some side dishes like to go with it. But the best part adout the food in Korea is the street food beacuse it's so cheap but yet so tasty that I could die for it.

Another reason, is the beautiful places in Korea. These are the reason why I would love to go to Korea beacuse of there food, the beautiful places, and the time I can get to myself.

One reason, why I love Korea as much is beacuse of the food. Kimchi is another type of food that I like beacuse it's spicy and I love spicy foods. Over all korea is a great place to visit. Han River has lots of beautiful pink bloosom tree's which are great for taking photograghs. Generic_City is just like California here in the United State beacuse it's where all the famous people live at. Second, it have the most amazing places to visit like Han River",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Remember you need put effort to your activitys in the work, school, sports and your life all need effort. Thomas Jefferson Prompt

Thomas Jefferson once said, Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Jefferson wanted the world to become more active in life whether if it is a physical.

Being active has many positives. In this world people have big reasons to have activity life for example, they need one work where maybe all the time they are move for this reasons and more I think that the people need one activity life.

Small actions like recycling or participating in community this help to disperse a good life for you and for the other people because people look that you have one purpose in the life. For a idle all is for tomorrow not take actions today, not take effort and if make this person not put the one hundred percent only put five percent. Nothing coming so easy you need effort, and dedication the inactivity not help you, the essence of the life is to crate good reason of live and work for yours dreams and goals.

The idle person is a person how not have activity, That person maybe not have dreams or goals or maybe your dream is be idle, but the poin is that a idle person not have reasons for the society, not have support for your community, and he or she is lost in the life",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
163456,"Driverless cars can be seen as an advantage or a shipwreck waiting to happen. Yes, humans have dreamed of this technology for generations, but is it truly what we need? Honestly, driverless cars could potentially cause more harm than good. They even sound scary: if a person, not in their right mind, can't drive a car functionally, then why can a computer? A super being that can't even think for themselves? I am against the development of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States.

As explained in the article, two separate companies already came up with patents for driverless vehicles. They used electrical cables/ magnets within the road to create a path that the automobile could follow. As said in paragraph three, these ideas worked surprisingly well, yet they were too expensive to be practical. This idea was invented decades ago; everything was cheaper back then. Nowadays, this idea also seems impractical. The cost for these ""smart cars"" will remain insanely costly. The manufacturers will be out money because the people won't be able to afford these high-priced gadgets.

I, for one, love car rides when I can't sleep at night. They help me drift off into sleep so easily and in a such a fast manor. Hundreds of people across the globe fall asleep at the wheel of an automobile every week. Even with all the distractions of driving, they can't resist falling asleep. So imagine, having no distractions at all, how easy it would be to doze into that comfortable state of mind. In the article it states that drivers are occasionally needed when the car is faced with a difficult task. If driver drifted off to sleep, a wreck is bound to happen. I also feel as though too many people will put too much faith into their vehicle that they'll become unaware and careful about what's going on in particular scenarios that they are needed in, and they'll find themselves in a fatal accident.

What good if a car in a round country trip if it's illegal to drive in certain states? What are people supposed to do if they cross the boarder into a state that disapproves of these new and ""improved"" vehicles? Just turn around and take another route? It's pointless to have a vehicle you can't take everywhere with you. Laws aren't just made for no reason; they're there to keep the community safe. If it's supposedly dangerous to ride in an unmanned vehicle, then why do it? In paragraph nine, it states that presently, traffic laws are written with the assumption that the only safe car has a human driver in control at all times. I believe in this law whole and completely.

In my opinion, driverless cars are unsafe. There are many statistics and facts stating that safety is a huge risk with these vehicles, and it's very true. A computer cannot possibly predict how a human mind will act or what a person will do unconsciously; these vehicles won't be able to have last minute reactions.

I am against the development of these cars because they're too expensive to manufacture at a good rate, they do require a driver at some point in time, and they're illegal in various areas of the United States. Driverless cars are thought to be the future; I want no part in such a dangerous place.",,0.0

Growing up, I was taught that adhering to the paths of others was the only sure way to achieve success. I did what I was told in order to fit in, to appease authority figures and to repay kindness and debts. He famously wrote, “Today you are You, that is truer than true. Over time, I became used to the idea that I had to do what was expected of me - but I was gradually losing my own sense of identity and purpose.

Realizing that I needed to find a balance, I began searching for ways to differentiate between external and internal pressures.

Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. It was an important assighnment so I did'nt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I have exprienced it when I make a wrong choice. Than, I asked my parents about it, and they said that You should not clean the car because there is a lot of different diseases that are in the car. I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and can't think about your question in the test. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. Then, I decided that I will not going to clean the car. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best.. One time, I planned to clean the car. Have you ever thought about asking other people for advice? Perhaps, people sometimes talk to more than one person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next step, and that person will stop thinking about their choice too much.

FIrstly, the person will be able to know which one is the best choice to go with. It is better to ask advise from the people that are your friend or family. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. My friend just ask me that if I have a test. I have exprience that when I don't find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something.

In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. I said to myself that my parents are right because I can be sick, tired, and can have different kinds of diseases. One time, I decided to play video games with my friend, and I actually had a test after that day. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great.

Imagination is very important, why you may ask, well with out imagination we cant think of new ways to solve problems or read. If imagination was never a thing their never have been numbers, books, or even a language.

Imagination is how we have things like google, computers, cars, books, and with out imagination we cant think of new ways it make the world a better place.

Lets say imagination was never a thing we wont know how to read or count to 10 because imagination is the key to knowlege Without imagination we will be having a lot of problems like how to comunicate, read, think, or even count to 10 thats why imagination is important.

With out imagination we as people cant make new things like books, art, or even better things thats why imagination is very important in may ways. Without imagination we cant think and when we cant think we cant learn or solve every day problems. Imagination is the key to making new things like cars, phones, computers, books, with out imagination we wont have things like cars, or phones. Knowledge did not just exist like that is was made how?

It takes an open mind and patience to change one’s opinion and create a different perspective, but with the right attitude it is achievable.. 

In conclusion, while first impressions are usually hard to shake off completely, it is definitely not an impossible feat. 
The saying that “first impressions are almost impossible to change” is one that often rings true in many situations. For example, if a person first sees another person they deem as unapproachable, unfriendly, or unkind, it may be quite difficult to convince them to give that person a second chance. As humans, we are capable of recognizing our own biases and can learn to consider another’s opinion without jumping to conclusions.  

On the other hand, there are also instances when first impressions are not necessarily set in stone and can be changed with deliberate effort and the willingness to look past one’s initial judgment. While the truth of this statement largely depends on the individual’s personality, experiences, and expectations regarding the particular person or situation they are encountering, it often holds true that a person’s initial impressions of something or someone can be hard to change. With the right attitude and a readiness to learn and understand, it is possible to modify one’s first impressions and develop a more accurate evaluation of the person or situation in question",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

The state senator should change the voting system to popular vote, because you're giving the American people what they want, it gets more people to participate and vote, and it lessens conflict.

To start, the senator should change the voting system to popular vote, because it gives the people what they want. If we rely on the Electoral College to elect our congress, presidents, senators, or whatever then what are the people voting for? People vote for who they want, so wouldn't make sense to elect the candidate with the most votes, since that's what the people want. Say there were two students running for class president, PROPER_NAME and PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME got 75% of the students votes while PROPER_NAME only got 25% of the students votes. In the end PROPER_NAME wins the election, because a group of teachers voted she should be president. That's how the electoral college acts, like their vote counts more than the peoples.

To add on, they should change the voting system to popular vote, because it gets more people to participate and vote. Many people are not going to waist their time and vote for the candidate they want, when most likely that candidate will not even get elected. This will affect the whole process, if there is a decrease in people voting. To encourage people to vote give them hope that the candidate they vote for will have a shot at winning the election. They should not have to think my vote does not matter. They should feel like they actually have a say in the election.

Lastly, changing the voting system to a popular vote can lessen conflict. Yhen people see that who they are voting has a great chance at winning, but does not get elected, let's just say there can be outbursts. People usually start to protest in what they believe is fair. To decrease incidents like this give the people a fair vote and fair election. The people should come together and fairly vote on the candidate they want to be elected. For the benefit of the American citizens, let them know they have a voice in the elections, do not take their freedom of speech away from them; give them what they want. Yes we can vote!

To conclude the voting system needs to be changed to popular vote, because it gives the people what they want, it will get more people to participate and vote, and lastly it lowers conflict.  ",,0.0

Plus, you have better opportunities and also you don't waste your time.

Even four years is not a bad idea because you do more and you learn more and you can get more information. The school will help you in life to know how to act and guide you in what is better and you get a better life with school.

School should be just 3 years instead of four. It's better 3 years than 4 because, you get a job, you get on the college earlier and you accomplish your goals before what you expect.

Most of the kids are looking for end the school early, is a good motivation for the students that they will end the school early. You have the same facilities even if you finish early or you take more time. If the student want to success in life it doesn't matter how much time it will take the only thing that is important is to accomplish the goals.

I am agree with the idea to finish high school in 3 years, I think that 3 years are enough for the student to learn all the stuff that needs. For example: sports, clubs and help the teachers. Three years of high school is a challenge. . Both options have a good opportunity to be in a good university. Before you finish high school, before you get in the college and you do not finish the university to old. High school is an important and necessary step to get to the successful, is a requirement in life because of the education and the things that you should learn. In that way maybe the majority of the teenagers will be more focus on what they are doing, and have a better future. That's why I like the idea. Is it a good idea to finish high school in three years than four years?

Four years is to long to graduate from high school. In four years the student learn more, but I don't think is necessary to be in the school all that time. The student have to be after school and take classes during summer is a lot of stress and a lot of things to do, but is not impossible. It just depends on what the student wants to do and what decision it will make. Four years is a good option, but three years or less sound better. The majority of the people when is young always think about that they leave school because they don't want to end when they get old.

Furthermore, the lack of an in-person class schedule allows students the opportunity to manage their time more effectively so they can accomplish work-related, educational, and leisure activities.

Despite the many advantages of taking online courses, in-person instruction is beneficial in helping to motivate students and ensure that they are on track to complete their courses. 

Finally, taking online courses enhances skills sought after by employers such as developing self-discipline and time management. By taking online courses, students can access their course materials any time, any place, as long as they have an internet connection, as well as watch lectures, take exams, and engage in classroom discussions.

In comparison to in-person courses, online courses offer a wide variety of courses and topics that may not be available in a local classroom setting",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
40310,"Hey there!  So, I was assigned this essay about asking one person vs. multiple people for advice, and I gotta say, it's a pretty interesting topic. I mean, who doesn't love getting advice from others, right? 

Personally, I've found that asking one person for advice can be really helpful. Like, when I'm trying to decide which TV show to watch, my best friend is always the first person I go to. She's got great taste in shows, and she's always willing to share her opinions with me. It's like, she's my personal TV critic or something! 

But, on the other hand, asking multiple people for advice can be pretty cool too. Like, when I was trying to decide which college to apply to, my parents were super helpful. They asked me what I wanted to study, what kind of environment I wanted to be in, and stuff like that. They were like, my own personal college counselors! 

I also found some cool quotes that relate to this topic. Like, Oprah Winfrey said, ""Surround yourself with people who uplift and support you, and seek out their advice and guidance."" That's so true! Having people around you who believe in you and want to help you can make all the difference.

However, there are also some downsides to asking multiple people for advice. Like, sometimes it can be really overwhelming to get too many opinions. It's like, how do you know what's best for you when everyone's got a different idea? 

So, after researching and thinking about it, I think the most beneficial method is to ask a mix of both one person and multiple people for advice. Like, have that one person who's always got great opinions, but also ask other people for their thoughts too. That way, you get a good balance of perspectives and advice. 

In conclusion, asking one person vs. multiple people for advice is a tough call. But, I think it's important to have a mix of both to get the best of both worlds.  Thanks for reading my ess",,1.0

In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person. Being creative would help them in several ways.

And lastly, art would help them be focused. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. Art would help them in life and school. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience.

The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways.

The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. This is why I would like to share this lesson with them.. Being creative wouldn't only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

For busy students, having the freedom of self-paced learning can be a double-edged sword, since it requires a great degree of discipline and self-regulating in order to ensure coursework is being completed in a timely manner. 
With the rise of online education, many students are considering taking classes online instead of attending traditional classes. Additionally, for students hoping to enter certain professions, attending traditional classes may be important for boosting one’s career prospects. Ultimately, online classes may provide some freedom and flexibility to students, but it is also important to consider the tradeoffs that come with such otherwise convenient learning opportunities..

You can experience different things which is phenomenal. In the future I hope we have less useless people and more people who like to get things done.  . Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic.

42681,"To quote Winston Churchill, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" 

Failure can help us become better people. It encourages us to think about the cause of failure and how to overcome it and become more successful. Staying motivated, being positive, and learning from our mistakes are all important aspects of recovering from failure. It pushes us to reflect on our mistakes and strive to make better decisions in the future. 
Failure is an inevitable part of life. Understanding that failure is part of the process can help us stay motivated and keep us from getting discouraged.

Finally, it is important to practice self-care when facing failure. We should learn from mistakes and view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. Staying positive and understanding that the process of success is full of highs and lows is key to overcoming failure and finding success. By viewing failure in this way, we can transform it from something that is bad into something that can ultimately lead to success.. It can be seen as both good and bad, but mainly depends on one's attitude towards it. Accepting our failures, rather than dwelling on them, is key to success. Failure can open up new opportunities to find success, build resilience, and gain valuable life lessons. It pushes us to stay positive, motivated, and determined, and to keep striving for the best. On the other hand, when we taste success, we should value it and continue our good work, rather than using it as the only measure of our worth.

In order to make failure a positive experience, it’s important to stay motivated. 

To summarize, failure is not the end of the world - it's just a roadblock that we must overcome in order to find success. It is normal to feel discouraged, but it is important to remember that setbacks are just temporary",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?         . I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.

We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They really can't do anything after school is done.

If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. We will also be getting home late. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool. Crashes could happen if it's too dark and the bus drivers can't see outside. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.

I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. I don't think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do.

However or whenever students graduate but parents want them all to graduate and make their future bright. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases.

Initially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years.

Secondly, this idea is good for the students who's entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc.

Students can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college.

There is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard.

Some students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life. Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home.

Suppose, they do not live good life in their back home. That's when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems.

Finally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. .

508578,"Having a curfew can provide a sense of safety for adolescents, as well as set up good habits for the future. Many people argue that curfews are too restrictive and infringe on teenagers’ freedom. 

In conclusion, teenage curfews provide essential safety, promote healthy habits, and encourage responsibility. Sufficient sleep plays a vital role in teenagers' growth and development, and setting a reasonable curfew helps promote healthy sleeping habits. A curfew also helps identify appropriate times for teens to come home, allowing parents to relax knowing when their children will be home and safe.

Another reason for a curfew is that it sets the stage for developing responsible habits. However, with the right amount of guidance and discussion, most families can work together to create an effective curfew that meets their needs. The primary focus of a curfew is to keep teenagers safe; as teenagers gain more freedom, curfews help enforce a range of limits that are necessary for their safety. Additionally, having a curfew can instill respect for authority and encourage teens to take responsibility for their obligations.

Not everyone agrees that imposing a curfew is beneficial. Although having a curfew might not be well-received by some teenagers, the long-term outcomes are worth the initial conflict.. It is important to consider these arguments when establishing a curfew for your teens.

With one photo taken of a mysterious figure, people think they have come closer than ever to knowing if there was life long before us on another planet. ""Unmasking the Face on Cars"" is a topic commonly talked about. Some say the Face was created by aliens, while others say it is the natural landform that caused it. Pictures were taken, and a conclusion have been made whether aliens created it, or if it was caused by a natural landform.

In 1976, Viking 1 was orbiting Cars to find a landing space for their sister ship, Viking 2.

While scouting out Cars, Viking 1 comes across an image that could likely show life on Cars. The pictured appeared to be a face, but was debated for a long time. A couple of years later in 1998, the Cars Global surveyor (KGS) took a shot of the ""Face"" which revealed a natural landform.

The image shot in 1998 was ten times shaper and more clear than the one taken in 1976. Once the second picture was taken, it was released to the JPL website showing all, that it was caused by natural landforms and that aliens were not the case. People began to say that the aliens were hidden by a haze since the camera it was taken with had to zoom through the clouds in order to take the shot. The people needed specific evidence to believe that aliens do not exist, so the KGS did just that.

To prove to all the people, a third picture was taken in 2001 by the KGS. The image was shot with the most powerful resolution. It showed the mysterious figure on Cars turned out to be a butte or mesa. These were landforms common in the American West.

The author of ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" believes that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. But, how well does the author support this idea? In this essay, I will evaluate the author's argument and use evidence from the article to support my claim.

Body:
Firstly, the author highlights the importance of understanding Venus's thick atmosphere, which is similar to Earth's but with a runaway greenhouse effect. This similarity makes Venus an ideal planet to study in order to better understand the effects of climate change on Earth. The author also mentions that Venus has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys that are similar to Earth's geological features, making it an interesting planet to explore. This shows that the author values the scientific benefits of studying Venus, despite the dangers.

Additionally, the author acknowledges the dangers of exploring Venus, such as the extreme temperatures, crushing pressure, and corrosive atmosphere. However, they also mention that scientists have developed technological innovations, such as the use of titanium and other materials that can withstand the harsh conditions, to overcome these challenges. This shows that the author recognizes the difficulties of exploring Venus but also believes that they can be overcome with the right technology and expertise.

Furthermore, the author notes that studying Venus can also provide insights into the possibility of life existing elsewhere in the universe. Venus, once a planet with oceans and a thick atmosphere, is now a barren wasteland, which suggests that life may have existed there in the past. This raises questions about the possibility of life existing on other planets that have similar conditions to Venus. The author recognizes the potential significance of studying Venus for the search for extraterrestrial life, making the pursuit of exploring Venus even more worthwhile.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, the author effectively supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. They highlight the scientific benefits of understanding Venus's atmosphere, geological features, and potential for life, while also acknowledging the technological challenges that come with exploring the planet. By providing evidence of the significance of studying Venus, the author makes a compelling argument for why it is worth exploring despite the risks. Therefore, the author's idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit is well supported and valid.",,1.0

For many of us, this transformation can be seen in the rise of smartphones, social media platforms, and other digital devices that have become so indispensable for modern life. But one area where technology has had an especially profound impact is on the art of photography. Since its origins in 1839 with French artist Louis Daguerre’s invention of daguerreotype process—the world’s first practical form of photography—the medium has come a long way. In fact, today photographers are able to control not just how they capture their images but also more precisely edit them after they're taken with various software programs like Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop Elements. Consequently, what was once considered a relatively basic craft now requires knowledge and practice to master it fully; knowing which lenses to use when shooting portraits or landscapes is only part of the equation since there's a whole realm dedicated to editing photos afterwards as well. Furthermore, advances in camera phone technology mean that almost anyone can take decent photographs without having to invest in expensive hardware or software solutions; all you need nowadays is your smartphone! This democratization effect clearly shows just how far digital photography has come over time and why even professional photographers must adapt quickly if they want stay current with new trends — something that may involve learning about photo manipulation techniques suchas HDR (High Dynamic Range) processing or achieving unique effects through computer-generated filters (like those found on Instagram). In conclusion, it’s hard deny that digital cameras coupled with image-editing programs have changed not just how people record their memories but also how photographers create special effects from scratch — making modern day photography both excitingly accessible yet technically complicated at the same time!

385707,"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the politicians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an end to the use of cars on a daily basis. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its streets are relatively free of cars and the residents of this ""carefree"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rid the world of cars along with the pollution and stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an antiwar revolution. There are days in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare and the air is hardly breathable, they are forced to enforce a partial driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany and Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also decided to become a member of the ever-growing ""carefree"" city club by starting a program that sponsors a carefree day once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winding roads and intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog and other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars and other vehicles. Vauban has greatly decreased the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article titled ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emerged into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winding roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores and residential homes. In Vauban, they have reconstructed the roadways and car garages into walkways and new stores, so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads and highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the constructions of highways and such. When reading the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an end to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see and the majority of them could be seen and reached by a simple bike ride and there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnecessary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragraph 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate driving completely so that the smog would disappear, they knew that with the millions of drivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illuminate the smog and still keep from having too many issues with its citizens, Paris decided to make it so that one day the drivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to drive their vehicles and the next day only drivers with odd numbered license plates were banned from driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who decided to drive their cars whether it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty-two euro fine. According to the article titled ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragraph 12, nearly four thousand drivers were fined throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illuminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogotá, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one day out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""Carefree Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogotá"" by Andrew Kelsey in paragraph 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, and other forms of transportations they're reducing smog and the amount of traffic jams and accidents throughout their city. After three years of this day being made two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali and Valledupar, Colombia. The day without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogotá in the mid1990s according to the article titled ""Carefree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky in paragraph 27. By participating in this day, the people of Bogotá have seen the construction of one hundred and eighteen miles of bicycle paths and added parks and sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every day, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people driving and obtaining their licenses has drastically decreased according to the article ""The End Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32.

For non-traditional students, online courses also provide a more flexible option for taking courses as needed from any location. Additionally, depending on the course materials, online courses can be more cost effective, with fewer materials required and lower tuition costs from universities. 

Being in a classroom setting also offers access to hands-on learning which can be immensely beneficial for certain subjects such as physics, chemistry and engineering. Furthermore, a physical classroom setting allows for a better understanding of the material, as students are able to interact directly with the instructor and receive demonstrations firsthand. Courses online are often more convenient and can be taken at any time from the comfort of the student’s own home. In a traditional classroom setting, students may benefit from face-to-face discussion and interactions with their peers, developing a stronger sense of community that can encourage higher engagement in class activities. However, depending on the subject material, taking courses in a classroom setting can offer its own unique and varied benefits that may prove invaluable in educational advancement.. Additionally, the scheduled class time can be helpful for students in developing a regular routine for studying and completing assignments, as well as for keeping themselves on track. 

Ultimately, the best option for any individual might depend on their own individual needs, the subject material, and their preferred learning style. 
Taking a class in a classroom setting as opposed to taking one online can offer a variety of distinct benefits.

Success requires hard work, unwavering motivation, and dedication.

It's important to stay focused on the end goal and never give up, no matter how difficult the journey may become.

This could mean taking small steps each day towards the ultimate goal, while also making sure to take time to reflect on what has been achieved thus far. It's not enough to just dream about being successful, you have to actually follow through with your plans and make sure that you're consistently moving forward.

However, I support that sometimes is good to make some changes to your plan, i'm trying to do the same thing, I'm doing my best, to achieve my goals.. and that happens because sometimes the people lost the interest, and sometimes because the people doesn't want to make an effort or is very difficult to solved it.

while, there are so many reasons why people that think that, their goals are very hard to achieve, because they have to do a lot of test, in those 4 semesters, homeworks, activities, but, suddenly a problem comes to the person life, which is that he has to work at night, have to take care of his mom, he have to pay rent, food, and it's very difficult to think about it, because in those cases is more problabbly that he leave school, and don't follow his dream of graduated from high school or university and get the job that he was dreaming with.

Therefore, even knowing that he was giving up, he started to create a plan, it was a bout a project that should chnge his life, some of his friends tell him, that he will never going to graduated, and that he wouldn't achieve his goal, but, he never give up, and when summer cames.

You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.

After years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.

You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.

In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? that's is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldn't go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?.

For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. . Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why it's a great idea to go and have lots of fun.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

Teachers and staff members are thinking that students are going home and they will do their homework or study, but what they dont think is that some people need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school, now with that less day they will be more students failing projects and exams, for example if a students used to study at the library after school he is not going to be able because it is going to be late by the time he gets out of school, they should keep the normal schedule for all the students that are getting benefits from it

People wants to save energy and money by taking away a day of school, but they dont think that students will be going home to use their cellphones, watch TV, play video games, and a lot of more things that consume energy, if they stay at school they are not going to be able to use their cellphones or any other electronic device, they will just use it during breaks and lunch, so that is less time than being home a whole extra day.

For all this reasons a think that it would be better for students to keep with the regular schedule and keep coming to school everyday, for the regular hours, in that case they will not miss any hours at work, they will have more time to study and to do homework at school, and they will not use their electronic devices as much as they would at home, even though the idea of saving money and electricity its such a good idea some students dont understand that and they will not do it at home.. Should school weeks consist on four days with days of 10 hours of school ? on my opinion there is no point on doing that, people that work is going to miss hours at work because of this, students are going to use that extra day to not study and be home doing nothing, and people instead of using electronics at school are going to use them more at home.

Some students work after school, they need time to go home and get ready for work and with school days being longer it would be pointless to work, you will be making 3 or 4 hours a day, some students,specially on senior year, need to pay bills or make money for the future to pay college",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) would help with students' emotions. This software would identify any emotion you have and the face expressions you have, and it would calculate ever days feeling.

First, it would identify any emotion you have. Just like Mona Lisa they found out that she was eighty three percent happy, nine percent disgusted, six percent fearful, and two percent angry. ""The facial expressions for each emotion are universal,""observes Dr. Huang, ""even though individuals often show varying degrees of expression""(like not smiling as broadly). Dr. Huang used video imagery, and tracked the new emotionrefognition software and the facial movements. In the real face or in the painted face of Mona Lisa. The software fan even identify mixed emotions (as in the Vinci's masterpiece) by weighting the different units in every expression is against a neutral face (showing no emotion)""

Finally, calculating your emotions. Are you asking yourself if the software fan calculate emotions like math homework? This professes begins with the computer constructs a 3D computer model of the face. The forty four muscles in the model must move like human muscles. Dr. Paul ENJMIN has classified some basis emotions like happiness, surprise, anger, digest, fear, and sadness and then associated each with fhrafteristif movements of the facial muscles. An example they give is, ""Your frontal is muscles (above your eyes) raises your eyebrows when you're surprised; your orbicularis Boris (around your mouth) tightens your lips to show anger."" Its pretty entrusting how it fan determined your emotions.

34261,"The Facial Action Coding System (FACS) is an innovative method for analyzing and categorizing human facial expressions. Developed by Dr. Paul Ekman and colleagues in the 1970s, FACS is based on the idea that facial movements can be broken down into discrete actions or units, which are then classified into a set of standardized facial expressions.
FACS consists of a comprehensive set of 44 facial action units (AUs), each representing a distinct facial action or muscle movement. These units are organized into seven primary emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutral (which can be further subdivided into other categories).
By analyzing facial expressions using this system, researchers can better understand human emotions, nonverbal communication, and their applications in various fields such as psychology, sociology, and even computer graphics and animation.
FACS has been instrumental in helping to develop emotion recognition software that can identify and analyze emotions in both real-time and pre-recorded video data. In the field of psychology, it has contributed to the study of emotional contagion and the spread of emotions among people in social settings.
In conclusion, the Facial Action Coding System has revolutionized the way we study and analyze human facial expressions, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and categorizing the complexities of human emotions.",,1.0

Therefore, it may be better for schools to opt for four 10-hour days instead of five 8-hour days, as this would balance out the resource consumption while still providing students with ample time for their homework and rest.. On the other hand, the change would place a strain on energy, water, and other resources, as more time in class would require more resources to accommodate. This change could have both positive and negative impacts on the students and teachers. On the one hand, more time in the classroom could enable students to pursue more activities, such as extracurriculars, that would otherwise be impossible due to the time constraints that come with a normal 8-hour school day.

467751,". There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. Im talking about if the school days should be extended by one and a half hours or not and the effects it'll have towards the students, teachers, and the whole school together.

So adding an hour and a half to a school can open a lot of opportunities to learn, more electives, and what most students would think of a longer day at school is bordem, but school is where you socialize the most during the day and as a kid school is where you meet most of your long time friends so there is more then just being bored at school it's a place you can socialize, have fun, and learn all in one day.

If it were up to me whether to leave the school schedule as it is or to add an hour and half to the school day I would have to disagree because if the teachers were to give piles of homework then when you get home you'd be exhausted and drained to the point where you arent able to then even if you did manage to then you would be so tired that it would effect the next day which would cause you to barely do any work in school so the students need to get out of school so they can get their homework done.

If students were to stay at school till 4pm assuming there bedtime is around 9pm then the would basically only have 5 hours to do their homework but wait so then imagine if they had chores to do around the house then once they've done their chores they'd be even more exhausted so after all that they had done what if they wanted to relax a little bit now they have such little time to do anything during their time off from school that they might have to stay up longer then they usually do now it's about 6am in the morning after last night they could barely get a goods night rest and their body and mind are completely drained for today and all they have is good breakfast to get their mind to at least keep them knowledgeable for the day and this whole cycle repeats over and over but then you can at least get a good weekend of relaxing so that you'll be refreshed for the weekdays.

I disagree with the decision to extend the school day because of the effects that it has towards students and how it can effect their mind and how much productivity they are able to produce could be affected due to overwhelming amount of work put upon a child. Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

In my option I think we should go with policy 1. Because we should be able to bring our cell phones to school in case of any emergency. Just as long as we have our cell phones turned off during class. And during any free time we should be allowed to use our phones. I mean what if one day our school locked down because some criminal was in the building. But nobody knew exactly where he was in the building. And it so happened that he was in one of the classrooms.

And a student had their phone and was able to call the front office or maybe even the police. To get some help eminently. That could be a very good help to the principal and the staff. I know that maybe the teachers don't trust us because of issues they've had before with cell phones.

But I really think this could be an excellent way to show the teachers that we are old enough to have some adult responsibility's try this new policy. Some people like the troublemakers ruin it for the rest of us because they don't know how to act like young adults. But I don't think that's fair for the rest of us who know how to act. Because all because of the childish behavior we also have to be punished. When it should only be the troublemakers punished for their actions. If this was your child would you want them to be punished from things they didn't do. Or would you want the teachers to take away special opportunity's like having their cell phones at school just because of some peoples decisions i'm more than sure you wouldn't want that to happen. What if your child was at school, and they were in a situation to where they needed to use their cell phone for an emergency.

132269," Completing high school one Are early can seem like a great opportunity for students to start their careers and gain experience. However, it is important to consider the benefits of completing the traditional four Years of high school before moving on to college. In this essay, we will explore the reasons who it is better to finish high school in the traditional manner.

Firstly, completing the four Years of high school allows students to prepare more for college. This time can be used to reflect on one's interests and career goals, and to take the necessary steps to achieve them. For example, the four Years of high school helped me to discover mu passion for a particular field and to work towards it. It also helped me to become more mature and prepared for the next step.

Secondly, it is too early for students to finish high school at the age of 1517. At this age, students MAU not be full read to take on the responsibilities of college life. The MAU not have had enough time to mature and develop the skills necessary to succeed in college. For example, mu Younger brother is 16 and is currently a junior in high school. When we have nothing to do or are having a conversation, I always ask him if he is read to go to college, and his response is that he is not even read for his senior Are. I understand his perspective, as I was his age when I was a junior.

Finally, students MAU not have had enough education to succeed in college. Completing four Years of high school allows students to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to excel in college. If students graduate early, the MAU be at a disadvantage in college, as the MAU not have had enough time to full understand the material. For example, I have heard from some friends in college that the struggled in certain classes, even though the graduated from high school at 18. This suggests that if students graduate early, the MAU not have had enough time to full understand the material.

In conclusion, completing high school in the traditional manner has many benefits. It allows students to prepare more for college, it is not too early for students to finish high school, and it allows students to gain the necessary education to succeed in college. High school is a crucial step in one's life, and completing it in the traditional manner can set the stage for success in the future.",,1.0

Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. I think the students should not be allow to use their cell phone in classroom, the effects of allowing them is not going to be useful comparing to how it will take their attention from their class work to the online world of cell phone. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that .

Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classroom's people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time.

Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need.

Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that it's, because that would wast all class's time, and students have more options to search online for their class work.

the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friend's secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it ,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true.

In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true. Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. Another example is that if your friend ask you if she looks good in a certain outfit , however, that is not your style and you don't like it at all , the best thing to do is to say that you like the outfit, if you tell her this , you will not hurt your friend's feelings.

One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she say that she will eat it later on.    . sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects.

honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

This type of attitude helped to foster a sense of mutual trust amongst us, as well as a willingness to work together. It has enabled me to approach each situation with an optimistic outlook. 
Having a positive attitude is essential for success in any aspect of life, including job searching, developing interpersonal relationships, and personal development. Instead, I decided to take it as an opportunity to find my true passion and use it to build the life I had always wanted. By staying optimistic, I was more likely to approach each of them with an open-mind and a good sense of humour. I was able to use these assets to find a job that I truly enjoyed - one that would challenge and reward me. 

I was recently laid off from my job, but I refused to let it define or dampen my outlook on life. The knowledge and skills I gained from my past job proved to be advantageous. It has helped me to better understand how to take advantage of the opportunities that come my way, create meaningful relationships with others, and continuously challenge and grow myself.. 

Having a positive attitude also helped me develop stronger relationships with my co-workers.

When we answer a question in the class or get a good grade in our class, the teacher, and students courage us but if we get a good grade in online class, there is no one to see our talent and courage us wihtout a small class massege. while we are attending school we will make a lot of freinds but we can't make any freind while attending online classes. We will be able to ask any question from the teacher at any time that we want, and they can give us the answer without waiting or searching it online. Attending online classes might look a smart idea for some learners because they might be able to stay home, and study, but there is absolutely a reason that we build schools. Attending school is a complete education than other ways. Comunicating is something that we will need to use in every day of our life. Attending school is a best way to have a bright future, a good way to communicate and a good preperation for college and bigger communities.. We will have a lot of events at school that we can celebrate with the whole school. When we are sick or we have a poblem that we can't go to school; attending online class will help us, but not for a long time. we build schools because we can understand the importance of studying at school.

Celebrating some events will give us the best memory while we can have that by attending school but not online classes.

Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. Education is one of the most important things in our life that we can't continue it in a good way by attending online classes. Attending online class might be good for some reasons. Attending online classes will be a big process, diffuicult, less apportunties, and there is no one to encourage us or show us what is good for us. Attending school instead of attending online classes have a lot of benefits that can change an idea of attending online classes.

Attending school can give us a freindly character by being able to talk in front of a group of people. Video conferencig has a big different with wactching what the teacher does in class, and what questions students ask.

There is a lot of ways that we can study but, attending school is the best way. We can not learn all the good things on online classes that we can by attending school. Therefore, attending school is a very good option rather than attending online classes. We need courage in order to study. You can learn better by making eye contact, and asking questions from the teacher rather, than just trying to learn online. Teachers don't just teach us a lesson, but they show us how to talk in a good way, and how to have a good character in our life. A big community like school can make us get used to talk in front of a group of people, while in online classes we are alone. When we go to college or university there will be a community bigger than a school. We can't celebrate any event while attending online classes.

Our chatacter, and the way we are is really important, and attending school will help us to have them in a best way. Students might get benifts by attending online classes, but not as they will by going to school. Attending school and Attending online classes.

Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing is not a really smart idea. Talking, and asking questions in front of the whole class or several classes will help us a lot to get ready for college, and more other presentations.

On the one hand, completion ahead of schedule is an attractive concept to many students who are eager to begin college and make an impact on the world.

In Hawaii, I helped repair fences on a ranch high up on volcanic slopes, tougher conditions than I'd ever seen back home! But the camaraderie between the cowboys there and their strong work ethic felt familiar. In Australia, I gained immense respect for stations that operate on vast tracts of remote rangeland. Adapting cattle breeds and techniques to arid climates showed the resilience of ranchers worldwide. 

Most memorable were my conversations with Māori ranchers in New Zealand. Hearing how their cultural traditions blend with ranching tradtions was truly fascinating. We discovered shared values of hard work, respect for the land and animals. Meeting people proud of multigenerational ties to the ranch, as with my own family, strengthened my cowboy pride. The program also allowed me to fulfill my adventurous side, visiting Sydney's iconic Opera House and hiking through New Zealand's breathtaking landscapes.  

For any young rancher seeking an opportunity to serve our agriculture community while broadening your worldview, I encourage applying for the Seagoing Cowboys program. You won't regret the unforgettable people you'll meet or places you'll see. Most of all, you'll return home with a renewed passion for ranching and its importance around the globe.

Ralph Waldo Emerson's quote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is highly applicable here. Although growing requires a degree of risk and vulnerability, it is those who take such risks and step outside of their comfort zones who find the greatest rewards.. I discovered a huge sense of satisfaction and accomplishment from pushing myself beyond my physical and mental limitations. Despite their initial enthusiasm for their goal, they eventually lacked the confidence and perseverance to stay committed to the goal. In order to meet this goal, I had to commit to regular running and to gradually increase the duration and intensity of my runs.

It is widely accepted that knowledge can be a great source of power and success in our lives. For those who invest the time and energy to learn, whether it be through inventing products or understanding how the markets works, knowledge has the potential to lead to many great opportunities. For example, thanks to the invention of the light bulb by Thomas Edison in 1879, he and other inventors were able to make a great financial gain. 

Another way knowledge can lead to financial success is through the power that comes with understanding the way the world works. People who are knowledgeable in a particular field, like finance, business, or marketing, can use their knowledge to their advantage and increase their financial stability. Through their knowledge of advanced engineering and usage of the 3D printing technology, inventors have been able to create profitable businesses designing and printing complex products. Take for example the invention of the 3D printer, which has revolutionized the field of manufacturing. Understanding how the markets work, how a business is structured, and the way people buy and sell products, are all examples of knowledge that can be used to drive financial success.

In conclusion, allowing cell phone use in the classroom is a reasonable decision. Nonetheless, the advantages of having cell phones in the classroom far outweigh any potential detriment.. Of course, guidelines need to be in place in order to ensure that cell phones are used responsibly and follow school policies. It can open up more possibilities in terms of learning, organization, and communication between students and teachers. By having access to their phones, students can contact their teachers with questions or for further help. Additionally, phones can serve as a tool to stay organized; reminders, to-do lists, and alarms can help students keep on track and stay on task.

Furthermore, allowing cell phone usage can help foster relationships between students and teachers. They can also take pictures or videos of their notes, which allows them to study more effectively at home or while on break. Students can use their phones to look up relevant information that can be used in class discussions. 
Cell phone use in the classroom has been a widely debated topic in recent years, with many schools implementing rules and regulations to govern their use.

Although having a positive attitude has a plethora of benefits, there can indeed be downsides. Positive thinking can lead to denial of the realities of the world and gloss over potential dangers. People with positive attitudes often display higher self-confidence, increased motivation, improved concentration, and greater engagement with day-to-day tasks. Additionally, having a positive attitude can cultivate emotional resilience and help reduce stress and anxiety. To safeguard against this, it is essential to remember to stay grounded in reality and remain open to constructive criticism and negative information.. 

Those looking to develop a more positive attitude can start by engaging in positive self-talk, being mindful of their thoughts and watching for signs of pessimistic thinking. Additionally, it can be useful to surround oneself with positive people, take breaks from negative influences, and focus on the positive aspects of oneself and one’s life.

Through Jefferson's words, young people are not only inspired to make use of their free time constructively but also strive to help others. 
In Thomas Jefferson's words, ""Never be idle. By using our time wisely, we can all come together and make a difference for future generations.. This could look like volunteering in local food banks, finding creative ways to engage with friends and family online, or even taking up a new hobby. No matter how big or small the contributions are, we can all do our part to not be idle.

Ultimately, Jefferson's words help us recognize the importance of not being idle and how it can both challenge and motivate us to strive to better our society. No person will have occasion to complain of the want of time who never loses any. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""

Ultimately, failure can indeed lead to success, as demonstrated by Winston Churchill's quote and by a range of successful individuals and entrepreneurs. By understanding the power of failure, it is possible to use it to achieve ultimate success.. Rather than being fearful of failure, it is important to embrace it and use it as an opportunity to learn and grow. Failure can actually be a stepping stone to eventual success.

One example of someone who successfully used failure to propel them to success is Thomas Edison. 
Winston Churchill famously said, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" This quote suggests that although failure can lead to a sense of disappointment, it does not have to be the end of the story. This is an insightful example of how failure can be used as a learning experience and can ultimately lead to success.

Similarly, many entrepreneurs have experienced a number of failures before finally realizing success.

When one is honest throughout their journey, relationships with others tend to thrive and love is shared in a meaningful way.

Conversely, when one is dishonest or attempts to be someone else, those relationships suffer and trust is often lost.

27611,"## The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

Over the past century, cars have become an essential part of our lives. We rely on them to get to work, school, and the grocery store. We use them to take vacations and to visit friends and family. But cars also come with a number of negative consequences, such as traffic congestion, pollution, and climate change.

One way to address these problems is to limit car usage. This can be done by encouraging people to walk, bike, or take public transportation instead of driving. It can also be done by making it more difficult and expensive to own and operate a car.

There are many advantages to limiting car usage. For one, it can help to improve air quality. Cars are a major source of air pollution, and reducing the number of cars on the road can lead to cleaner air. This is especially important in cities, where air pollution can be particularly bad.

Limiting car usage can also help to reduce traffic congestion. When there are fewer cars on the road, traffic flows more smoothly and there are fewer delays. This can save time and money for everyone on the road.

In addition, limiting car usage can help to promote physical activity. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise, and taking public transportation can also provide some physical activity. This can help to reduce obesity and other health problems associated with a sedentary lifestyle.

Finally, limiting car usage can help to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. Cars are a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. Reducing the number of cars on the road can help to lower our emissions and reduce our impact on the environment.

There are many ways to encourage people to limit car usage. One way is to make it easier for people to walk, bike, or take public transportation. This can be done by building more sidewalks and bike lanes, and by improving public transportation service.

Another way to encourage people to limit car usage is to make it more difficult and expensive to own and operate a car. This can be done by raising taxes on gasoline, parking, and car registration. It can also be done by making it more difficult to get a driver's license.

Limiting car usage can have a number of benefits for individuals and for society as a whole. It can help to improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. There are many ways to encourage people to limit car usage, and these efforts are worth making.",,1.0

Music, drama, and art classes have a wide variety of benefits to offer when it comes to educating students, so it comes as no surprise that they are taught in schools around the world. 

In addition to traditional music, drama, and arts courses, other types of electives could be offered that target some of the most popular student interests such as robotics, computer programming, and athletic programs. Moreover, by being able to choose classes for which they have a personal interest, students are more likely to engage in the material and take interest in learning it.

Counselors or teachers can be of great help in narrowing down the selection of electives and helping students find the courses that best fit their individual interests. However, the debate of whether these creative courses should be electives rather than mandatory courses continues to be a topical issue. 

In conclusion, it is clear that assigning music, drama, and art classes as electives rather than mandatory courses would provide students with a better educational experience. By offering personalized support, they can guide students towards exploring subjects that they would otherwise be unaware of or reluctant to take. By offering students a variety of creative and innovative courses, schools can accommodate individual interests and provide a balanced learning environment. 

By allowing students to choose which electives they take, they are free to pick the skill-sets they are most passionate about and that best match their goals. Electives provide students a wider range of interests to explore and the opportunity to customize their educational journey. Having the freedom to make their own decisions is a valuable learning opportunity for students and teaches them the skill of prioritizing and decision making in a safe and supervised environment. Through these electives, students can pursue the activities or talents that best suit their individual talents, explore innovative subjects that peak their interests, and gain valuable experience in decision making.

I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have.

So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you don't know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it.

failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didn't find the solution at your problem.

Dear [Senator's Name],

I am writing to express my opinion on the current system of electing the President of the United States. As a concerned citizen, I believe it is crucial to either maintain the Electoral College or transition to a popular vote system. In this letter, I will present my arguments in favor of both options, considering various sources and viewpoints.

Firstly, the Electoral College, established in the Constitution as a compromise between a congressional vote and popular vote, ensures a certain level of certainty in the outcome, as stated by the Office of the Federal Register. This system requires a candidate to secure a majority of 270 electoral votes. This prevents the possibility of a disputed election, which could be more likely in a direct popular vote system. As Judge Richard Poster explains, the winner-take-all approach in most states results in a clear outcome, even if the popular vote is close. In 2012, President Obama won 61.7% of the electoral vote, despite only receiving 51.3% of the popular vote. This demonstrates the stability of the Electoral College system.

Secondly, the Electoral College ensures that the president represents the interests and concerns of all regions, as mentioned by Judge Poster. With no region having enough electoral votes to secure victory, candidates must appeal to a wide range of states. This prevents narrow regional favorites from ignoring the needs and interests of other areas. In a direct popular vote system, candidates might focus solely on high population areas, neglecting the concerns of smaller or less populated regions. The Electoral College encourages candidates to campaign across the country, leading to a more inclusive representation.

Furthermore, the Electoral College helps to narrow down campaign efforts to key swing states, as Judge Poster argues. This leads to increased voter attention and thoughtful decision-making. Swing states play a crucial role in determining the outcome of elections. By concentrating campaign efforts in these states, candidates are forced to address the specific concerns and issues faced by their electorate. This gives voters in these states a heightened sense of involvement and ensures that their voices are heard.

Additionally, the Electoral College gives adequate weight to larger states, thereby restoring political balance, as explained by Judge Poster. While the Senate's mal-apportionment can create inequality, the Electoral College counteracts this by providing more electoral votes to states with larger populations. As a result, presidential candidates devote more attention to these states during their campaigns. This balances the influence of smaller states and avoids a scenario where only densely populated areas decide the outcome of the election.

On the other hand, it is important to address the concerns raised by opponents of the Electoral College system. Bradford Plume argues that the system is unfair to voters, as candidates tend to focus on swing states, neglecting states that are already solidly in favor of one party. Plume asserts that this results in certain states being ignored during campaigns. However, it should be noted that the need to campaign in swing states ensures that candidates must address a broad range of issues and concerns, even if some states are considered less competitive.

Considering the arguments from both sides, it is evident that the Electoral College provides stability, legitimacy, and representation in the presidential electoral process. While it is not a perfect system, it ensures a fair distribution of political power and prevents a potential crisis arising from a disputed election. Implementing a direct popular vote system may lead to various complications, such as the possibility of run-off elections and less diverse representation.

In conclusion, I urge you to consider the advantages of maintaining the Electoral College or transitioning to a popular vote system with careful consideration of both sides of the argument. The well-being of our democracy and the fair representation of our citizens depend on the thoughtful analysis of these important factors. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

115382,"For centuries, students have endured the same rigorous schedule of school.

Five days a week for seven hours, with only two days of rest. Students have been told that school can be perceived a safe haven where one can escape their challenges at home and have a comfortable place to learn and be with friends.

However, in recent times this has been proven difficult due to the adversity that students face in a school setting from bullying to a fear of one's safety.

Therefore, allowing students to attend online classes is beneficial because students can escape the burden of bullying, take care of their mental health, and feel comfortable in their learning environment.

Bullying has become a major issues in schools.

Modern media generally illustrates bullying as a physical concept as in fighting, but through social media, a new type of bullying has risen known as cyberbullying.

This has allowed individuals to sit behind a screen, hiding their identity, to target other users by commenting or posting cruel things.

When an individual is bullied, it not only affects their lives at home but also school.

Therefore, giving students the option to take online classes can serve those who are bullied by not allowing them to feel targeted the moment they step foot in a school.

Although, schools have attempted to implement change to stop bullying, it is apparent that it is an aspect of life that will sadly be difficult to make disappear.

Without the option of online schooling, it teaches students who face bullying that they must endure the trauma and there is no escaping the cruelty in a school setting.

Schools must take a stand for those who are bullied and notice the positive impact that online schooling can have on an individual contributing to them no longer be treated as inferior by another person and finally discovering their self-worth.

From kindergarten to senior year, students are discovering who they are.

This is a fragile time period for an individual because one begins to from relationships and learn what's makes them happy.

A major aspect of being happy is mental health.

However, school has become a burden on ones mental health by overloading students with an immense amount of stress.

For example, students have been told that their success is primarily based upon a grading scale.

One must have a 4.0 grade point average and be involved in every club to reach the ultimate taught goal of getting into college.

This idea of success has caused students to forget the importance of their mental health and allow stress and anxiety to quickly dissolve ones healthy living. The option of online schooling can effectively ensure that an individual is able to keep their mental health under control by relieving the pressure of a school setting.

Anxiety plays a major role in ones testing ability.

A school environment can place more pressure on a student to not only please themselves, but also their teacher.

The atmosphere of a school may enhance the learning abilities of one individual, but to another can have detrimental impact on ones mental health leading to major long term effects.

At homeschooling, can help stop the epidemic of the increase in mental health issues in students, such as depression and anxiety, by giving them the opportunity to be in an environment that accommodates to their learning style.

Lastly, a student should be able to consider their school as if it is a second home.

However, after the 2017 tragedy at Parkland high school in Florida that led to the death of 17 students and left many injured this became very difficult.

After the devastation at Parkland, it sparked the fear of one's safety at school that would ultimately haunt students until they graduate.

The most important aspect of school should be that students feel safe. With online schooling it can allow those students with a fear to be comfortable in their environment and not constantly worry about their life.

Another reason online schooling would benefit students, is due to the issue of overcrowding in many schools.

For example, Generic_School in Generic_City has a major issue of overcrowding.

As students walk through the hallway, there is a swarm of people that make it very difficult to walk comfortably through the halls.

Schooling at home can leaven the overcrowding of schools and create a more pleasant atmosphere.

Furthermore, schools would not have to use numerous trailers in order to accommodate to all students.

Online schooling can allow students to not only feel more safe, but also stray from feeling claustrophobic in schools that are overcrowded.

To achieve success one must feel that they can learn and prosper in a place that best fits their needs.

A school environment does not always accommodate to certain individuals.

With the option of at homeschooling it can positively benefit students by allowing an individual to stray from bullying, work on their mental health, and feel safe.

The needs of a student should be the most important concept to those of higher power in schooling staff.

If a student feels that they will thrive with at homeschooling, then why prevent these students from reaching maximum potential.

Online schooling is not for everyone, but it can guide those who may be struggling by giving them an alternate option to achieve success.",,0.0

So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. Maybe our ""selves"" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself"".

This is the other side of the coin. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning.

I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. Everyone else is taken. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. Seuss, ""Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't care''. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Be Yourself. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. It is a most important thing to be yourself. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you.

Another way to look at ''finding'' yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. it is alot like osmosis. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that ""To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended.

However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. At first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. I couldn't have said it any better.

Essentially, and ultimately, you don't have any choice in the decision about being yourself. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk.

The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Consider he words of Dr. Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow.

3299,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue their learning during the break. Every individual at some point in their life has had to make a project of their own. Whether it be a project at school or a project at home for themselves to enjoy. So when it comes to these summer projects, they should be student-designed because an individual has more freedom to choose a topic of their own, they are less restrictive, and students can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them.

A student has more freedom when choosing a topic of their own with a student-designed project. For instance, a lot of the projects in school are tied to a specific topic. When it comes to choosing the type of project, at a first glance, there may seem like there is a lot to choose from. But in reality, this is just the illusion of choice. There isn't a lot of room for creativity and imagination, therefore there isn't much freedom. Many individuals will agree that with more freedom, they have the liberties and creativity to come up with something that is unique. Others may argue that with more freedom, a student might not stick to what they what they are supposed to learn, But that is far from the truth. It is the opposite, students are more restricted when they are forced to create a project with a topic they are not the best at, which leads to the next point.

Student-designed projects are less restrictive. For instance, much of the work we are assigned in school is teacher-designed. From personal experience, when a project is teacher-designed, a lot of the work can be mediocre, as apposed to a project that is student-designed. When students aren't allowed to come up with their own ideas, their imagination is bound and restricted. Some teachers may argue that it doesn't matter that students are restricted, all that matters is that a student gets the work done, but that is not correct. The student wont be as motivated and will turn in a project that is has no effort, therefore getting a lower grade.

individuals can use their best strengths to make a project that is less stressful for them with student-designed projects. A project can seem like a large and outstanding task to finish for a large amount of students, and as a result, puts stress on an individual. A student-designed project can relieve plenty of this stress, as students can choose a subject that they are best at. It is easier for someone as they are more comfortable with a topic they are more knowledgeable with. Other individuals may argue that students should make an effort to choose a subject they aren't familiar with, but many can disagree because choosing a topic someone isn't familiar with puts more stress on a person and can lead to them struggling to learn.

Summer projects help students learn during the break, but students should ultimately decide on designing their own projects for individuals to continue to learn. At the end of the day, they should have the freedom to enjoy doing what they are best at they shouldnt be stressed over work they aren't comfortable with in the summer.            ",,1.0

47154,"""Emotions are an integral part of human nature, and the ability to understand them can be a valuable tool. However, the adoption of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) technology for classrooms raises several ethical, practical, and financial concerns that must be taken into account.
While the FACS technology may seem revolutionary, it's essential to remember that the human brain already excels at detecting emotional cues, rendering such technology largely unnecessary in classrooms. Moreover, the use of this emotion-detecting software in educational settings raises privacy issues and the potential for invasive monitoring of students' personal and emotional states. The lack of understanding of the underlying causes behind these emotions also poses a risk of misinterpretation, which could lead to further emotional trauma.
The cost-benefits of adopting such technology also need to be considered. While the potential of personalized learning experience may be beneficial, practical and financial constraints need to be addressed. Adapting the software for real-time teaching methods may lead to constant disruptions, and personalized computers are financially prohibitive for most schools. Ultimately, it is crucial to remember the human element in education. Emphasizing emotional understanding, empathy and personal connections should not be overshadowed by the integration of this technology in classrooms.

Both sides have good benefits, but traditional classes overtake online classes by a big long shot.

The option to take classes online hasn't always been available. The address to mobile devices, computer, and Wi-Fi didn't exist at one point in time. Going back thirty years; The option to attend classes from your phone or computer wasn't a thing. Every single student that attended school had to take classes in person, which forded them to adapt to a classroom environment. The big plethora of benefits that you receive from taking regular classes ranges very far and wide, but there are only a few that should be acknowledged. These include a hand on experience, more valid information intake, support from your classmates, and it prepares you for the introduction of your future job.

Hands on learning is the number one factor that differs online classes from regular classes. Having a professional in subjects like math in your vicinity at all times is the best way for a student to get a good grasp on information. Whether it be a professor or a student; The help and guidance of another mind will always have a more significant stretch over trying to learn a subject or topic by yourself. Taking online classes will have some guidance; However, if you're study on your work and your not in a video all with your professor, then how are you supposed to get the answer, and looking on the internet for the answer is not the most trustworthy thing to do.

Classmates have such a huge impact because they'll be the next best thing to a professor when it domes to helping you learn. You might not understand the information, but changes are that one of your classmates fully understands it, and they will help you understand the don dept most of the time. In certain situations; One might take online courses because their income cannot support them, which is totally understandable, but the circumstances of the benefits from taking online or traditional classes still apply. Being in a classroom when taking classes for your dearer are vital. Most businesses don't allow you to take online classes. They require you to have a certain number of hours in a certain class, and an internship on top of that.

There will always be the few that counterclaim that online classes are so much better than regular classes, and they might even go as far as claiming that they're a blessing in disguise; However, those individuals tend to throw off the potential downfalls and only look at the few benefits that exist. I agree with most of the benefits like the independent work environment, the accessibility of class from home, and the exception of taking these classes because of financial reasons, but online class students are yet and still heating themselves out of the large mass of benefits that regular classes offer.

255829," Dear [StatS Senator],

I am writing to Express my views on THS Electoral College and its role in THS selection of THS President of THS Units States. While some Argus that THS Electoral College is outdated and unfair, I bliss that it is a necessary component of our Democratic system.

First and foremost, THS Electoral College allows for a candidate to win THS presidency without winning THS popular vote. This is an important consideration as it Ensures that THS candidate who is best suited to lead THS country is Elected, rather than just THS candidate who is popular in certain regions. For Example, in 2000, Al Goes received more individual votes than Songs W. Bush nationwide, but Bush won THS Election, receiving 271 Electoral votes to Goes's 266. This shows that THS Electoral College allows for a more nuanced and balanced selection of THS President, rather than just relying on a single popular vote.

Additionally, THS Electoral College allows for a candidate to focus their campaign Efforts on key swing States, rather than just focusing on highly populated urban areas. This Ensures that candidates as reaching out to a diverse range of voters and not just relying on THS support of a FSW key regions. This is important as it Ensures that THS President is Elected by a rSprSsSntativS sample of THS American people, rather than just a select FSW.

Furthermore, THS Electoral College Ensures that THS President is Elected by a group of Sectors who as trusted to make THS best decision for THS country, rather than just relying on THS support of a single popular vote. This is important as it Ensures that THS President is Elected by a group of individuals who as not swayed by political pressure or short-arm gain, but rather as making a decision based on THS longer best interests of THS country.

One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didn't heard when she say that she will eat it later on. For example ,one of Generic_Name's friends tells her something and ask Generic_Name to keep it a secret,

the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friend's secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didn't tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it ,

the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name.    . sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects.

honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles.

Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings. Is honesty always the best policy?

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true.

In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someone's feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Distance learning has some notable drawbacks compared to traditional classroom-based instruction. Distance learning can also be less engaging for students, as it can lack the competition and collaboration seen in traditional classrooms.

Studies have found that interpersonal interactions between teachers and students are important for learning. Traditional classrooms provide students with the guidance and support they need to be successful, as well as an engaging learning environment that promotes engagement and independent learning.. For example, distance learning may not allow for face-to-face interaction, making it difficult for teachers to provide feedback and support. Finally, teachers can serve as a model of success and inspire students to reach their goals.

While online courses do offer a more flexible learning option, they cannot replicate the communication, competition, and inspiration of a traditional classroom. Furthermore, there may be less motivation to succeed as there is no sense of competition.

Attending classes in person is an invaluable educational experience that offers communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers that distance learning cannot. Communication, competition, and inspiration from teachers can all have a positive impact on student performance and engagement. Interaction with peers is limited and feedback from teachers can be delayed or difficult to understand.

On the other hand, when students work in a group, they can take advantage of being able to brainstorm. However, working in a group can stimulate a student's creativity and collaboration skills, allowing for a deeper understanding of difficult topics.

When working alone, a student can benefit from undivided attention and full focus on the task at hand. Working in a group setting can also provide a student with instant feedback from their peers, leading to an improved understanding of the subject being discussed.

In conclusion, both working alone and in a group have their own set of advantages, and each student should take into consideration their own working style when deciding which is best for them. Working alone provides undivided attention and fits better with some student’s learning strategies, while working in a group encourages collaboration and group think which will undoubtedly benefit the student in the long run.. Students can work together to generate ideas and come up with solutions, usually leading to a deeper understanding of a subject which wouldn’t have been reached when working alone. Working alone will also give a student the liberty to use new strategies which would allow them to work through obstacles in their own way.

It is for these reasons why having a good character is essential in everyday life. For example, if someone is wearing bright colors and interacting boisterously, they may be categorized as irresponsible. On the other hand, someone in a more toned-down ensemble and keeping to themselves may be perceived as introverted or shy. Acquiring these skills can help minimize conflict or difficult social interactions, and can make living a happy and successful life much easier. 

Having a “good character” is a term often used to describe those with admirable traits, such as being honest, generous, and respectful. In order to ensure that each person is in their best possible state of mind, it is important to take the time and effort to work on the self and improve their character. It is important to consider that these assumptions are not always accurate, and that each person’s character is unique to them. It should be noted that having a good character is not only beneficial for the individual, but also those around them. . Friends and family can be more confident in the trustworthiness of the person, and colleagues can potentially become more productive as a direct result. It’s important to remember that these characteristics are skills, and a person must actively work on honing their character in order to become a better person. 
In this day and age, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one’s own character traits and the implications that they can have. Oftentimes, people make snap judgments based solely on the way somebody interacts with others or what they’re wearing on any given day",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of longer summer vacation must be taken into consideration by families. If planned and organized in concert with parents and school staff, longer summer vacations can be beneficial for teens as they can spend more time with their family and friends. Studies have found that longer summer vacations have many benefits, such as providing more time for socialization, improving mood and cognition, and broadening opportunities for exploration and discovery. Teens who have a lengthy amount of time away from school-related activities and responsibilities may experience a drop in academic performance, as disruptive behavior can manifest from boredom. 
Summer vacations provide teens with a unique opportunity to take a break from the normal routine of the academic year and spend more time with their friends and family. Additionally, longer summer vacations can help strengthen family bonds, as teens are able to spend more quality time with their parents, siblings, and extended family.

How many time in the day do you use your phone? Well av you know your Students at School have cell phone. Some are caught using them during clave, at lunch, or during School hour Vat time. I believe you Should allow Students to use their phone Vat School. There are many reason why. Just think, the School could have an emergency evacuation, the Students might need a way to call home to be Safe. Or even for an after School activity, they might have forgotten Something at home or with Someone they need to contact. Also it could be for the guardian contact to make Sure their child iv ok. So cell phone in School might just benefit the Students more than you expect.

Students Should have cell phone for emergency purpose. There might be an evacuation they required the Students to immediately leave the School building. The Students are no longer able to use the School phone. So if you allow cell phone they can call their guardian in cave of an accident involving them or other. Now doesn't that Found like a back-up plan?

Many Students join after School activities. In casual Situation Some might leave Something they really need. Sometimes the child will need to call their guardian to tell them their need. If you permit cell phone Students will not be able to call their guardian easily. Yes, there are School phone, but Some people don't answer unknown caller.

Hence, Sometimes the child may have to Secure with the guardian. Which can also mean the guardian call the Student assuring the child'V Safety. In most cave the child iv after School doing an activity. Yes, the child may have adult Supervision, but the guardian Still iv not there. Think of how assured the child'V guardian will be once they hear the child'V voice.

In conclusion, I believe Students Should have the right to use cell phone Vat School. With their cell phone ITV more Safety and assurance to the guardian. Also it help with to the need of a Student. Fact of the matter iv children communicate regardless of a cell phone. So why not enhance the cell phone for Safety issue also.

The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits.

On the other hand, students may find themselves unprepared for the speed at which they complete their education and may have difficulty keeping up with the intensity of the program. The primary motivation for this type of program is to give students an academic head start on college or vocational school. Another potential disadvantage is that the 3-year program limits students’ opportunities to explore multiple subject areas and discover their interests.

95705,"As an eighth grade student, I believe that it is important to learn from one's own mistakes. However, seeking guidance from experts and authorities can also be beneficial. In this essay, I will explore the pros and cons of both approaches and provide examples of people who have made their own decisions and learned from their experiences.

Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be beneficial because it can provide a fresh perspective and potentially save time and resources. For example, if a student is struggling with a particular subject, seeking guidance from a teacher or tutor can help them understand the material more effectively. Additionally, seeking guidance from experts can provide a sense of security and validation, as they may have more experience and knowledge in a particular area.

However, making one's own decisions can also be beneficial. When individuals make their own decisions, they are able to take ownership of their choices and learn from their mistakes. This can lead to personal growth and development. For example, a person who has made a mistake and learned from it may be more likely to make better decisions in the future. Additionally, making one's own decisions can lead to a greater sense of independence and self confidence.

There are many stories of people who have made their own decisions and learned from their experiences. One such example is Steve Jobs, the cofounder of Apple. Jobs made many unconventional decisions throughout his life, such as dropping out of college and focusing on developing Apple. While these decisions were not always successful, they ultimately led to the creation of one of the most successful companies in the world.

Another example is Oprah Winfrey, who made many difficult decisions throughout her life, such as moving from Mississippi to California and pursuing a career in television. While these decisions were not always easy, they ultimately led to her becoming one of the most successful and influential people in the world.

It is important to learn from one's own mistakes because it can lead to personal growth and development. When individuals make mistakes, they are able to reflect on what went wrong and identify areas for improvement. This can lead to better decision making in the future. Additionally, learning from one's mistakes can lead to a greater sense of self awareness and self reflection.

Not growing up and making one's own decisions can have a negative impact on personal development. When individuals rely too heavily on",,1.0

I don't agree with your decisions about the new school policy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress.

If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishment's in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future.

Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. Changing school policy is a bad idea.

We all as humans make mistakes, therefore we can not or it is harder for us to find our own character by our own self.

As humans we all have at least someone that we admire a lot,and we see them as a person we should imitate so we can be even a bit as them. Many people are going say that we can be our self, but even though we can be as we want in certain things, our character is formed by influences beyond our control because we tend to try to fit in society, we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire.

As humans we tend to try to fit in society; we like to feel liked by the people around us, so we act different than we actually are. As humans we dont like to be categorized as different and our main goal in a big percentage of people in the world is to fit in society and that is something that can not be controlled, but it helps us a lot to find our self afterwards and form our character at the end.. Scientist have said that having the fear of making mistakes will make it harder for people to achieve their most wanted goals in life. Many famous es have said that they also had followed someone else's steps to get where they are, so being influenced by the people you admire might help the people a lot to achieve their goals as it did with the famous people,and they also said that the people they admired a lot was the one helped them to find themselves, because if it was not for them they would have probably the same as they were before being famous.

In conclusion, we can decide how we want to be but that does not remove the fact that our character is mostly formed of influences that we can not control because we tend to try to fit in society,we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire a lot. Imitating someone else that has had such a great impact in life might be good for your self and you might achieve your goal because that person did. trying to fit in a society might be the biggest reason why we do not act as we want and tend to act as everyone else in front of other people,because we fear that if society categorize us different then society is going to dislike us,however, there is some people that are careless of what people say about them. The feeling of being liked by society in most cases makes us feel pride and self confidence, which is fine but makes a line between being our self and being influenced. Imitating someone in any way will make our self to struggle when trying to develop our own character because we are thinking of how someone else would think. It is part of being a human that we care about what society says because we do not want be seen as someone different that can not fit. Being insecure is a huge obstacle and mistake for people to get to choose their own character, because it does not let us decide for what we really want,therefore people should learn from them which it will hopefully help people to develop a better character. People are going to find themselves mostly from experiences and influences that they can not control,however you should have some of your own character to do things so when you achieve something important you feel better about yourself, but we,the people tend to act different so people like us and it is something inevitable,either control in life. For example, students in schools dress as the trend is, so they can fit in society,even when they grow they will care how they look.

The fear of making mistakes influences part of our character. we fear many different things in life for example,our appearance, if we think our appearance is not as we want, we get insecure in many different ways but, it is a huge help in the development of our own character because we learn from those mistakes. Even though our character is formed by influences of other we admire we also have to have our own character into it, so we can feel the pride of achieving a goal that has had our effort in to it. There is always someone that will not care at all of what people say about them which is good,but, there is always a time where they cared or will care about it. Fitting in a society might be hard for some people,even frustrating, but people still are willing to do it so we can not be seen as different.

Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them.

If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose. Students Need to Identify a Career

I am in 11th grade and I still thinking in what career should be better for me, if I could expected a career by the time I entered to High School, I could not being worry about what career should be better for me. By the time the students enter to college it will be much easier for them because they have already decided what career should be better for them.

There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. That's why it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school or at least when they are still in high school.

In my opinion it's good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because if they could identify a career that they might think they would like, that could be a lot of helpful, because by the time they go to college they don't get stress because they don't have much time to decide what career could be better for them.

This story make me think about it if i have the election to choose how i can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school.

I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home that's great idea. Many student suffer of depreciation and that is so bad for them. If they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is more better for their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still going at school, but it was diffult for them had to continue study and also after that they giving birth too. Could fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study. Below for those students that don't like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it.

During school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting.

Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. He will try to find the way to solve the problem by himself.

Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. Yes i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus.

-The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, "" the intelligent student told me that i can't do anything or i can't speak very well English"" still if we want make our goals we can do it. Without go to the school.

-For example:

If a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are:

- Spend more time in the computer

- More focus in the homework

- Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want

- Study all the day

- No talk with your friends during your class

159473,"Girls,let me tell you my big mistake that i did,we talk about 5 months as a friend after we talk for 5 months he make me his girlfriend,at the time i was still feeling butterfly for him that first years is was perfect like any relationship,those 12 months i was so happy,i always told him that he was ''the love of my life'' and i just say it for everything we went trough since middle school also,because he was my first boyfriend and my parents were fine that i was dating him because they though he was a good person.

Girls,find a guy who is real with you all the time they might be a lot of guys out there that can pretend that he is in love with you. i'm not thinking to go out with a guy because girls you have to love yourself to be able to love other person.

In conclusion,if you are honest with yourself your life will be okay without any problem.     . When i was in 8th grade i met this person i was so in love with him,he add me on snapchat so that same day that he add me i post a pictures that i was in the field,35 minutes after he text me i was so happy,and nervous because i liked him so we start texting but we never talked in person,a week pass by and he start to being disrespectful with me,playing with my feelings i knew that we were just friends in those time. One thing you don't ever forget is to be honest,and to be real with yourself and everyone around you.

Girls,if you reading this please don't make the same mistakes that i did in my past be always honest with your partnership or whoever, because the consequences are not how you might think. Yes, they might be real and make you feel butterfly 5 months or 6,but things changes in this life person change not everything is always the same,anyways he started to lie to me when i knew that truth of that problems is when he start to hurt me all the time but when you love someone you let them hurt you,so i keep letting him hurt me,i started crying and to supplicated to stop hurting me he stop like any relationship we were okay for a week and then he started doing things that hurt,he started talking to girls,and cheated on me but us girls we so dumb that we keep them.2 Years after i was in depression i did not tell my parents they found out when they take me to the hospital because i passed out in my room crying, without eating for days i was in the hospital for a week after that i was able to go they take me to therapy. One day i told him that i want him to be honest with me,he always said that he was honest with me,2 week pass by he were keeping playing his little games and i did not say anything i just leave his message in delivered,1 years pass by he texted me saying that he felt so bad for everything he did to me in the past,i just told him everything that i felt for him in the past but he was not honest with me. after 5 months of going to therapy,i was able to talk him to close a chapter because i learn to forgive but in my heart i felt hate for him what i told him was ""i love you but i love other person more than you and that person i'ts me"" yes, he cried but he did not deserved me .Finally i let toxic people leave my life,i'm not going to lie like i'm afraid to talk a guy again because i feel they will hurt me.

288247,"Hey, Mrs. Johnson!  I'm super excited to write this essay about the four day work week with ten hours of school each day.  I know, I know, it's a pretty cool topic, right? 

So, let's start with the pros.  First, a four day work week would be super awesome for students like me who have a lot of extracurricular activities and stuff.  I mean, think about it, we'd have more time to focus on our passions and interests without feeling so burnt out from school and work. Plus, it would give us more time to spend with our families and friends, which is like, super important for our mental health and stuff. 

But, there are also some cons to consider.  For one, a shorter work week might mean less money for our families and communities.  Like, think about all the bills and stuff that need to be paid, and how a shorter work week could make it harder for people to make ends meet. And two, some people might not be able to adjust to the shorter work week, especially if they're used to working longer hours.  It could be really hard for them to balance their work and personal life, and that could lead to stress and burnout.

So, overall, I think the four day work week with ten hours of school each day could be a good thing, but we need to consider all the pros and cons before making any big decisions.  Like, we need to think about how it would affect our families, communities, and workplaces, and make sure everyone is on board with it. 

I know, I know, it's a pretty complicated issue, but I hope you can see where I'm coming from.  Thanks for reading my essay, Mrs. Johnson!  I hope you give me an A+!",,1.0

The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions. I think it is a good idea that people should ask for others peoples advice because they can learn extra info from them. You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. They can also get help someone make a better choice. The more people ask for advice they will get multiple opinions. If I dont ask questions iill never get any responses or advices. Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people.                                                                                                                                                                                              .

To begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when I'm mad or just in general. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. Do you agree or disagree with ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. Some people take learning as a joke but I take it seriously because I want my dreams to come true I always wake up in the morning happy to go to school to learn something new. It is all imagination it helps a lot of people each and everyday by studying, learning or reading books because I enjoy it a lot it helps me fill up my emptiness.

In conclusion, I agree imagination is more important than knowledge because it a it of people just like it helps me. Learning is important it helps people get to where they want to be either it's a dream, a location or read and write things. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph.

In addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn. Learning is important because it helps you reach your goals in life, and studying is not my thing but imagination helps me with studying because I can imagine the things we talked about. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I don't learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class.

Also, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Reading books is more important to me because it cheers me up when I am mad so I don't pop off and say things I regret saying . Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I don't understand especially when it comes to English and math",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go.

Technology has had a profound impact on our lives, both good and bad. This includes monitoring the way we use technology, as well as implementing safety measures to protect our data and privacy. With these measures in place, the positive impacts of technology can hopefully be maximized while its potential harms are minimized.. To counteract the potential negative impacts of technology, it is important to take steps to ensure that technology is used responsibly and safely. On the other hand, technology has also created new problems, such as cyberbullying, identity theft, and the spread of misinformation. On the one hand, technology has enabled us to become more connected than ever before, allowing us to communicate and collaborate with people around the world. This has revolutionized the way businesses work, helped create jobs, and given us access to information at a speed that was previously unimaginable. By allowing us to access too much information too quickly, technology can also lead to feelings of information overload, alienation, and even depression.

On the positive side, cell phones can be used to help students keep up with course work and class notes. When used correctly, cell phones offer an effective tool for students to access course information and engage in meaningful discussions. Not only do they provide a convenient way to take notes, but they can also be used to access educational websites, virtual classrooms, and online videos and articles. 
Cell phones have become invaluable tools, especially for students. Proper responding to emails and texting in the classroom must be monitored to ensure cell phone use will be productive and not a distraction.

Overall, the use of cell phones in the classroom should not be discouraged, but instead should be used with caution and structure. However, it is important to be mindful of how cell phone use can negatively affect student grades if not used properly.. For instance, students may be distracted by their phones, leading to a decrease in information retention and overall learning. Additionally, cell phones can be used for communication purposes, such as group collaboration on group projects or critical discussions of course material.

418139,"Driverless cars are obviously cars without drivers. Many have envisioned such an idea as revolutionary as Sergey Erin. As a matter of fact google has built such cars since 2009. However, some people see this as a flawed idea and see this as a bad thing. I'm honestly split about each side.

Driverless cars do have a lot of positives. They are ecological friendly, so they save both gas and money. Also, they are way more flexible than a bus could be, since it can go anywhere. Not to mention they are way safer than normal vehicles, alerting people who are distracted by anything while on the road. Speaking of safety, that seems to be a major area that is addressed. For instance, when there is a problem the car would state it and giver the passenger the option to take over. Another way is the cars expensive sensors that detect when there's going to be a problem, and automatic breaks the car to avoid any damage.

However, there are some glaring issues that must be addressed. First off people will get bored because they are passengers. Plus being alarmed of this every time your dozing off, by the car itself, isn't going to help anyone, just annoy them. On top of this driving cars is a rite of passage into adulthood. Taking that freedom away is just wrong. Not to mention, who's to claim in an accident involving two of these things from different companies. It's stated in the paragraph that new laws must be made for these kinds of cases, and that could take years.

In conclusion, I'm split about this idea. Driverless cars might be the next evolution for the motor companies, but it is flawed in some rather serious degrees. ",,0.0

So, I know it's not exactly the coolest thing to do, but I think elementary schoolers should have to do community service. I mean, think about it, we're basically just sitting around all day, learning stuff and stuff. It's not like we're actually contributing to society or anything. But, if we did community service, we could be helping people and making a difference! 

First, community service can teach us important life skills like responsibility and empathy. Like, if we're helping out at a soup kitchen, we're not just sitting there playing games on our phones. We're actually helping people who are hungry and don't have enough food. And, if we're cleaning up a park, we're not just messing around, we're actually making the place cleaner and nicer for everyone. 

And, it's not like it has to take up a lot of time. Like, we could do it during recess or something. I mean, I know we have a lot of fun during recess, but think about how much more fun it would be if we were doing something good for the community instead of just playing tag. 

Plus, it can be really rewarding. Like, I heard about this one kid who did a community service project where he made blankets for homeless people. And, he was so happy and proud of himself when he finished. It was like, wow, he made a real difference in someone's life. 

So, yeah, I think elementary schoolers should totally have to do community service. It's not only good for us, but it's good for the community too. And, who knows, maybe one day we'll be the ones making the rules, and can make sure that community service is a requirement for everyone!

321268,". I want to make my family friends and all of my relatives feel proud of me. i took him into my room and we were talking about somethings and recently he came up with a topic which is call depression. My friend he was so motivated. when i see him i was little happy to see him after a long time. Forget about everythings that happened in the past.

After he have told me all the lesson i was feeling way better than the past i realised how crazy i was before and the way of my thinking. It also make our family think that we are smart and make them feel proud of us.

The first thing we all should do is to love our self if we cannot do that it will be hard for us to control our positive attitude. I agree with that because positive attitude always bring the success in our life. I decited to not to keep my life stop because i dont want to be in the same situstion as before. I started to giving up on my life i didn't feel like to doing anything in life. Only those will understand if they ever gone through depression.

That was the worst feelings i ever felt in my life. I didn't have anyone to share my feelings all i did is just to kept that in my heart and made my self cry alot. i was trying so hard to figure out why this is happening to me and where does this come from and didn't get any response out of this. This is why the positive attitude is the key to success in life. It will help all of us to become successful in our life. Some of us might have have seen some people they can't be satisfy with their life beacause of their behavior and the way how they think of there life. I was starting to loose friends in that time. It also happened to me when i was freshmen during the highschool year. I throught of myself i will never be successful in life.

After few days passed one of my friend came to my house just to visit our family member and me. It helps people to get more friends and make a good community. We can get so much benifit out of it. All people love those who have positive mentality and a good personality. i broke down myself and put my self somewhere where no one can find me. In order to be successful in life u need to be respectful with every single things that we do everyday. He knew how i was feeling with my life so he started to giving me some lesson to make me feel better and everything. Whatever he told me it was so appriciated to me and it forced me to changed my self to become a normal and to be a possitive person. Every one of us need to love their selves and if they think in a negative way to bring the success in their life, it will never work thats why we all should try to handle our mind in a positive way. We are human we cannot be same as others in some point we make mistakes in life we always should try to move forward. Its not their fault maybe the situation makes them to be like that some of us living with depression and it causes a massive differents into our brain our thinking area and more other part or side effects. As a human no body is happy about their life in some point their sad but the main thing is we got to move onto forward. It helps us with alots of things in our life. Every single day was the hell of my life. First he told me i need to changed the way how i think about my self and people and he also told me there are many people who always try to push others down and make them feel bad and make you think something that is not good for you. My friends told me to ignore those and listen to my own heart. We need to conduct our self in a perticular way to bring the power of success.

There are many people who can't show their love to people or who are kind of broke on their life most of them have negative mentality. I didn't talk to anybody just trying to stay at home all the times and realised how could i get out of this kind of situation. I tried so hard to change the situation but it didn't work. if we don't love our self we can't love others as well as you do to ourself. I felt negative every time.

I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change. . I think we can't compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work.

To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school don't have to follow,

First,

we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and that's not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students.

Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school.

Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things,

so they will not have time and that's will be a reason why they can left the school.

Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time.

Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they can't do all.

People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week.

Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit.

One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off.

Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they don't have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do.

students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn.

Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do.

all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day.

352001,"Distance learning is extremely beneficial for certain groups of students. It can help them focus on the main task. It also assists them with better use of their time, and a deeper understanding of the academic material. For some people school is a more social area than an academic one.

At school, they are many distractions. It is extremely easy to get lost in these distractions. Such as student disrupting class, Teachers personal issues, and classes being pushed for scheduled activities. Also, some students can get away from not learning the material by cheating off their classmates, but If there is no one to cheat off of then their only way of passing is by learning it and doing the word for themselves. Distance learning may not remove all the problems, but it reduces most of them.

Attendance may also cause problems for many students. If they miss one class they are already behind their fellow classmates. Which means they have to catch up and learn double the material for that class in a short amount of time; not being fully able to understand the topic. If these students were to learn at home and on their own time then they will be able to manage their time and word efficiently. For example, If every class is the same length, but one student is able to learn and perform well in math better than science. They could start the day with math, so they can get a better understanding and spend more time on the subjects they really struggle with life science. This type of learning will help the student progress and not have the stress of late assignments if they are spending the most time on what really matters, so they can fully experience a good education.

Many students struggle with school, and it isn't because they land intelligence or struggle to learn the material. It can be other factors such as environment and mental health. Some students may experience tragic things at school life bullying or stress. This will physically and mentally drain a student causing them to perform bad academically. Distance classes will made the environment more friendly and safe. As the saying goes ""there is no place life home"". Students will be able to go through their day without the anxiety or stress teachers and peers put on them. This allows the students who struggle socially to have the same chance of a good education just life everybody else deserves. No fear of group projects or public speaking it will all be informational and academically based. To help the students who are not capable of this and not forcing them to feel unsafe while learning.

Distance learning is truly beneficial for some students. It can really made the difference of passing or failing. The purpose for school is to educate the youth and help to prosper. If we cannot fully do that then there is no reason for that student to struggle to achieve that in school. If these students benefit from distance learning than lets help them do what schools are meant to do, To educate them.",,0.0

Ultimately, the decision to adopt or reject a four-day, ten-hour school schedule should only be made after careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks. This could encourage them to better manage their time, become more organized, and complete tasks more efficiently. Proponents of this idea argue that it could provide students with more breaks and lighter homework loads, as well as giving them more time to explore and pursue activities beyond the classroom. This could lead to feelings of exhaustion and could be particularly difficult for younger students who are already more susceptible to tiredness. Furthermore, the extended weekend could allow for good recreational activities and potentially more time spent with family.

On the flipside, the downside to a four-day, ten-hour school week may be that students will be required to attend school for a much longer period of time each day than usual. On the other hand, opponents of this concept worry that it could cause kids to experience fatigue and lack of focus due to the length of each day.

In terms of advantages, there is the potential for improved student productivity due to the shorter but longer school days. 
The debate over the potential pros and cons of switching to a four-day, ten-hour school week has been raging for some time.

Summer projects CRN also teach them about responsibilities. School already teaches students to be responsible and to identify what are their priorities rt the moment. Once summer comes in and students free themselves with so much free time in their hands; Learning is no longer r priority. Some tent to lack motivation and that results in laziness. Putting their responsibilities side and not their main priority. Lang responsible is r trait you'll find yourself using often in your dry to dry life. With r summer project schools are making sure students have something that will be of their interest, providing them the opportunity to obtain knowledge rt the some time.

Students will have to learn about time management. In order for students to be role to have free time during their break they'll have to learn how to manage their time. This is another form of identifying your priorities. Time management is something that we RLL used to be more successful in life. It's something students will use for their jobs, rt home, school, and even in their hobbies. It's r trait that will make students life less stressful and they'll be more likely to get more work done effortlessly.

Some would sorry that summer is meant for students to have r break from school and that theirs no point in summer break if they still have to do school projects. This is why student designed projects are something school should provide students with. It gives them something productive to do while learning traits they'll use RLL life long not only rt school. Teaching them discipline and dedication. In conclusion schools should provide students with student designed summer projects to assure that they'll be learning, not only about school but personal traits that will help them in the long run while doing something of their interest that won't feel forced. ",,0.0
714042,"Committing to a job at a Young age is bad and good idea, why you may ask? Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasn't really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. There for you wouldn't be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically.

As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. For example let's say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker.  . It'll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable.

""In some societies, students are expectected to identify a career by the time they enter high school."" Personally i think Choosing a career at a young age is a bad idea, because like i said it is a proven fact that your brain isn't fully developed at a young age. The more you get older the more you know about the job so you'll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. When you're older you'll be an expert and know the job by memory. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you don't really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. There for you should not choose a career when you are in high school and just enjoy your school year's once you graduate you'll regret it and wish you had just relaxed but that does not mean you should'nt plan for upcoming careers you should have more than one option, prepared for after you graduate. Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. Your brain also isn't fully developed until you're older it is a proven fact.

Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age.

874747,"If our school changes the schedule of five-day school week that each day is formed for eight hours, instead having a four-day school week of ten hours per day, but having an extra day off. Then, he really needs to work after school to pay himself. Therefore my school should not change

its schedule of having five days of school.

Based on the reason that I gave, it's clearly to see that having four-day school week offers good benefits that the regular standard weed of five-day does not give, but I strongly believe that the five-day school week is way better then the four-day school week. . Therefore four-day school week should not be accepted in my school. As example of this is myself. So, he pays rent, his cell-phone payment and food. Have you ever felt that the weekend isn't enough? that you might wanted to do some kind of activities during weekend, but the time wasn't enough. A perfect example of this is my friend, PROPER_NAME. They think that weekends aren't enough and they really need and extra day off to cover their needs. PROPER_NAME would be involved on a problem, because he wouldn't be able to have a job after school. Actually, my school should not adopt this new idea, because the standard week formed by five day of eight hours increases the productive time, and it allows student to do different kind of activities like have a job, homework, play sports or even share time with family. Therefore the schedule of five-day school week should not be changed.

Another reason why my school should keep its schedule of five-day school week is that, the standard week of five days gives the opportunity to do activities after school, such as: work, homework, sports or spend more time with our families. If my school adopt this new policy, I wouldn't be able to keep my grades high and I wouldn't pay attention to the last period of class, because by that time I would be tired and bored of have stayed that long and having classes the all day. I bet that you did it, and I'm going show you my point of view of why we should keep having a normal school week of five days instead of a four-day school week.

Although some say that my school should adopt a four-day school week by adding two hours each day. In this case students might feel tired of being ten hours in school, and at the end during the last period of class they wouldn't pay attention to the class, because they would feel to tired of had spent almost half-day in school. Actually, my school should not adopt that kind schedule, because the standard week with eight hours each day increases the productive time, and the standard week allows student to do other activities after school, such as: work, to do homework, sports or even spend more time with family and friends.

Those who believe that the school should changed their schedule from standard five-day work week to a different schedule model that consists of ten hours per day have their reasons. PROPER_NAME goes to school, but he lives alone. They also think that two extra hours each day are not a big sacrifice, knowing that they are going to have an extended weekend and making the same amount of hours which means the same paycheck amount, and they might have time.

One reason why the school should not changed their schedule of five-day school week to four-day school week is because, the standard week of five days increases the productive time of each student. Although some say that my school should adopt a new kind of schedule that some business are implementing called four-day work week that consists of extending the school day two hours",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Overall, both working alone and working with a group have their own pros and cons. Working alone often offers more control over the project and less distraction, putting the individual in a more focused and creative environment.

Ultimately, the best option should depend on the particular task and what resources are available. But, there is a potential for conflict and confusion with increased input from others.

Depending on the situation, it's a good idea to be aware of body language and practice exhibiting respect and kindness towards others as these behaviors can assist in creating a favorable first impression. It is important to remember that, despite the fact that some first impressions may be impossible to change, everyone is deserving of kindness and respect.. The significance of a first impression is relevant in a myriad of situations, as it has the potential to shape the way one is perceived.

The way one presents themselves and their immediate attitude and behavior are some of the biggest factors in leaving a good first impression. This can be especially true in cases when an individual has a knee-jerk reaction to a situation, as these types of initial reactions can be difficult to alter.

I disagree with this because some students might not have time for activities also some students might not be into it, or some students haven't done activities before. Some students enjoy doing activities while some students don't like it at all or some students have not tried doing activities before. Do You think all students have to do actives?

First, Not everyone likes doing actives some students prefer to star home or go out with family or friends. Students can be very Bush BH doing homework or projects for classes. Students won't have time to do activities if there Bush BH doing homework and projects. If the do actives the will get stress and won't be able to spend time with family or friends. Everyone should at least spend time with family. For example, some students don't spend a lot of time with family and if the do activities the won't ever spend quality time with family or won't be able to go out.

Next, Some students might not be into activities. Some students haven't tried doing activities and are scared to do it for example, like sports You can get hurt or break a bone or something. Some students don't like doing activities as much as others do. Some students don't find it entertainment for them and others do and its okay everyone is different. The principal cant make students do something if the don't like it or haven't tried it before in there life.

In conclusion, I don't agree that all the students have to do extracurricular activities if the don't want to or don't like it and the principal cant make them do it either. Everyone can decide for themselves and pick what the want to do. Everyone can dislike it or like it It's up to them. The principal doesn't have to make them.  ",,0.0

291800,"Cs an eighth grade student, I believe that students with a C average or lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. While it is important for students to maintain a certain level of academic performance, it is also important to recognize that not all students are able to achieve a B average.

Firstly, it is important to consider the fact that students with a C average or lower may be doing their best to pass their classes. It is possible that they are struggling with certain subjects or facing personal challenges that make it difficult for them to maintain a higher grade. By allowing these students to participate in sports and other activities, we can provide them with an opportunity to develop other skills and interests outside the classroom.

Secondly, it is important to recognize that students with a C average or lower may not be able to participate in sports and other activities if they are required to maintain a B average. This can be particularly problematic for students who are already struggling academically, as it may be even more difficult for them to meet both the academic and extracurricular requirements.

Finally, it is important to consider the fact that students who do not meet the B average requirement would still be able to experience activities outside the classroom. This means that they will still have the opportunity to develop social skills, teamwork, and leadership skills, which are all important for personal and professional development.

In conclusion, I believe that students with a C average or lower should be allowed to participate in sports and other activities at school. By doing so, we can provide them with an opportunity to develop other skills and interests outside the classroom, while also recognizing that not all students are able to maintain a higher grade. Additionally, allowing these students to participate in extracurricular activities can help them develop important social and leadership skills, which will benefit them in the future.",,1.0

With students texting friends, playing games, and checking social media, it can be difficult for both students and teachers to focus on the class syllabus and stay on task. 
Cell phones are a great way to keep in touch with the outside world, but they have no place inside a school building during class hours. 

Although phones can be useful in a classroom setting for certain activities, such as searching for information or taking notes, the potential distraction that can come from phones should not be allowed to disrupt a class. Having phones in the classroom also disrupts the learning process as it encourages students to fall into a multitasking mindset—responding to messages or notifications when they should instead be concentrating on the lecture. For these reasons, student should not be allowed to bring their phones into the classroom.. Allowing students to bring their phones into the classroom can be more of a hindrance than a help. They can cause noise, distraction, cyberbullying, and cheating. On the other hand, having phones can also give rise to cyberbullying and cheating, which can be harmful to students and make for a worse learning environment.

This occurs naturally as the conversations become more involved and there is an increased understanding of each individual's ideas, strengths, and values.

Another example of first impressions changing is reflected in friendship circles. But, after conversing and speaking with them, one may become increasingly drawn to them and so the opinion is altered.

The ability to change one’s initial image is something that needs to be appreciated more. As each person may have a unique story to tell, it is important to remember that we all have the potential to change our image in the eyes of others.

One example of how first impressions can be changed is seen between long-term co-workers. 
First impressions are often seen as set in stone but, in reality, they can be changed over time. It is a good thing to have flexibility and an open mind, and to let someone's personality come through before forming a lasting opinion..

She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates.

326889,"Some people believe that The Face on Mars was created by aliens. It's good to use your imaginations, but sadly, that wouldn't be the case. Most to even all evidence proves that The Face is simply a natural landform on Mars, similar to natural landforms on Earth. It's a common happening, and the most logical answer.

Us scientists at NBSB have been researching The Face for years. Sure, the first picture of The Face did resemble that of a human face, or an Egyptian Pharaoh as it says in paragraph 2 of the article ""Unmasking the Face on Mars"", but since then we've been able to get better, higher quality pictures that show that what made The Face look like a face was simply shadows. The Face is a landform on Mars, and that's simply it. It's similar to ""landforms common around the American West"", as it states in paragraph twelve, it's the ""Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"" here on Earth.

If that doesn't convince you that it's not aliens that created The Face, hopefully this will. In paragraph 5 of the article on The Face, it states ""Some people think the Face is 'bona fide' evidence of life on Mars evidence that NBSB would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists."" This isn't true. If NBSB were to find life on Mars, it would benefit us. We wouldn't have a reason to hide it. BS proof, that's also stated in paragraph 5, ""defenders of the NBSB budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars."" Now, if defenders of our budget wish that there were ancient civilizations on Mars, don't you think we wouldn't hide it? This shows that it would benefit us if it were that, proving further that aliens aren't the creators of The Face.

If you're still not convinced, look at the picture we took of The Face on April 5, 1998, ""when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time"". NBSB got a picture ""ten times sharper than the original Viking photos"", as stated in paragraph 7. This means that it was much easier to see The Face, and what it actually was. The pictures revealed something amazing... the Face was ""a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" I know, shocking! But these are just the facts. Some argued that it been cloudy that day on Mars, so ""alien markings were hidden by haze"", as it states in paragraph 8. So we took a better picture on April 8, 2001 an cloudy day on Mars showing, again, that it was just a landform. Nothing more to it.

In conclusion, the Face is just a natural landform on Mars, similar to those here on our home planet, Earth. BS far as anyone knows, even NBSB, there are no lifeforms on Mars of any kind that made The Face. BS it says in paragraph 12, the pictures we took on April 8 were so high quality that """"if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"""" If there were any kinds of aliens or alien markings on the Face, or creating the Face at that time, you would have been able to see it in that picture. The Face ""is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa"", landforms commonly seen here on Earth. That's all there is to it. No aliens. No magic. Just natural happenings, that's simply all the Face is.",,0.0

786283,"With more in-depth learning, students can gain a better understanding of both the subject and the processes of learning. Having older students pair up with younger students in a school setting is one such practice that can be beneficial in a multitude of ways. Working collaboratively with other students is proven to increase student engagement and help them to better retain knowledge. Through working with their older peers, younger students can learn how to be organized and responsible. An older student can help to instill a sense of responsibility and provide assistance as needed. For example, younger students may look up to older students and benefit from their guidance. Furthermore, the different viewpoints presented by each student can lead to further exploration of different ideas and allow for a broader range of knowledge. 

Moreover, this practice can contribute to higher academic achievement. Younger students may find themselves inspired to learn more due to the example of their older peers. 

For these reasons, having older students pair up with younger students in a school setting can be highly beneficial. Rather than a student's age or ability level dictating their success, a focus on collaborative learning gives an opportunity to all students to become engaged with and supportive of one another. 

One benefit of this practice is that it fosters a sense of community and helps children learn how to work together effectively. By working together and depending on one another, all students involved in the program will learn how to create beneficial relationships with others. 

Finally, having older students pair up with younger students can help to boost self-confidence and motivation for all involved. 
As a way to nurture a positive and supportive learning environment, it is important to encourage collaboration between students of different ages. Having to work together to solve problems can also encourage creativity, improved storytelling, and the development of better problem-solving skills. Meanwhile, older students may be fulfilled by the knowledge that they are helping younger generations and feel more motivated to complete their own work. Not only is it a means to foster a positive and supportive learning environment, but it is also an effective way to facilitate the development of life skills, improve academic achievement, and boost the self-confidence of all students involved..

Working alone gives one the independence and freedom to choose their own course of action. However, working alone can also lead to feelings of isolation and potential stagnation as one person may lack the resources and knowledge to tackle complex projects.

This ensures that tasks will be completed according to one’s preference and timeframe.

At the end of the day, students need to find a balance between taking a break to rest and restoring their motivation for learning.. 

However, opponents of longer summer vacations suggest that additional days away from school could lead to a decline in academic performance. Additionally, a longer summer vacation could provide more opportunity for learning through activities such as volunteer work, internships, or travel experiences that might not be available during the school year. 

Ultimately, whether a longer or shorter summer vacation is preferable depends on a variety of factors. 
Many argue that longer summer vacations would be beneficial to children and teenagers, as it would provide them with more time to relax and enjoy themselves. Additionally, such a decrease in structure and routine could be damaging to children’s development, and intense summer courses may be the only solution to catch up after a longer absence from the classroom",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
446983,"It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team.

Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. For instance, working in group gives more ideas from different people's sense of humor and people get chance to work with different people whose thoughts and working style is different. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.

To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone.   . There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

However, there are also policy-based solutions that can be used to achieve long-term improvements in poverty and economic inequality. These direct services could help provide immediate aid to those facing poverty and potentially lead to long-term positive outcomes for citizens if they are able to access these services and gain the skills they need for a better future. Overall, the American government has a number of strategies at its disposal to reduce poverty and inequality among Americans, and the potential impact of these solutions on the population should be thoroughly investigated.. There are several approaches that can provide direct services to citizens, such as providing food assistance, providing job training and support, and advancing policies to increase income and wages.

My trip was very Exciting, may not sound very Exciting, but it was. As a Seagoing Cowboy I got to take car of tho animals on tho ship. You may Wonder why would Thor BO animals on a ship, that is because it was 1945, World War II was over in Europe, and many countries work loft in ruins. To help those countries recover their food supplies, animals, and Moro, 44 nations joined together to form UNRWA (tho United Nations Roof and Rehabilitation Administration). Who to work't watching over tho animals to got to play different kinds of sports like volleyball, tennis, and baseball. My trip was also very Exciting because to got to so different places to have Noor soon before.

My trip was unbelievable because I got to so places i'VO Noor soon before. Ono of tho places I got to go so was tho Acropolis. I'VO Noor got to so tho Acropolis before but now i have soon it in person. Another unbelievable thing I got to do was ride tho Gondola ride to Voice, Italy, a city troops with water. Tho last thing I got to do was list tho Excavated castle in Photo, and marveled at tho Panama Canal on my way to China.

Tho reason my trip was tough was because I got to BO a guard all night. I chose to BO a night they didn't chose mo I chose them. Tho job wasn't so bad, it was tough because I had to make sure tho animals work Food throw times a day. I also had to watch and make sure that nothing was strange, and I had to make sure Thor wasn't any invaders. I also had tho job of making sure to toll tho captain tho weather reports.

813262,"By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want.

The benefits that you get does not end there. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". Like for example let's say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you

Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students. I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. Another thing is the food. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that.           . Let's say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do.

Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways.

By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you.

There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
673777,"It can influence relationships in both a positive and negative way, impacting overall well-being. A positive attitude can shape the way we think and act, and can help us to stay optimistic when faced with difficult situations.

On the other hand, a negative attitude can bring obstacles into our lives. By taking a conscious approach to how we think, changing our perceptions and developing a positive attitude, we can experience positive outcomes and greater well-being. It can also boost confidence, open doors, and invite opportunity into our lives. 
Attitude is an important factor in how successful a person is in life. The implications of attitude can be seen both personally and socially; it can shape behavior and reactions in our everyday lives.

Having good attitude can be seen as an asset—it can minimize stress, help build strong relationships, and increase productivity. It can affect relationships by creating tension and misunderstanding and can even lead to isolation. A negative attitude can also be a barrier for success and can cause us to overlook potential opportunities.

Ultimately, attitude plays an essential role in how we experience life. Those with a positive attitude are more likely to attract positive life experiences and decisions, while those with a negative attitude can easily find themselves in a downward spiral. But it is up to us to take control of our attitude and make each day count.",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working in a group can be helpful. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince I'd rather work alone. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn't have been blamed for.

So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time.

Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. But thats a whole different story. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around.

227064,"(I am not capable of personal opinions or beliefs. Therefore, I cannot argue for or against the continued operation of zoos. However, I can provide some points that may help you build your own argument.)

Zoos have been around for centuries, and their role in conservation and education has been a topic of debate. While some people believe that zoos are essential for preserving endangered species and educating the public about wildlife, others argue that they are cruel places where animals are kept in captivity. In this essay, I will provide some reasons and examples to justify the continued operation of zoos.

Firstly, zoos play a critical role in conservation efforts. They provide a safe environment for endangered species to breed and increase their population size. For instance, the California condor was on the brink of extinction in the 1980s, with only 27 birds left in the wild. However, thanks to the breeding programs at zoos, the population of the California condor has increased to over 400 individuals today.

Secondly, zoos provide an opportunity for people to learn about wildlife and the importance of conservation. They offer educational programs, interactive exhibits, and guided tours that teach visitors about the animals' habitats, behaviors, and threats they face in the wild. For example, the San Diego zoo has a conservation carousel where children can ride on animal themed seats and learn about the different species that the zoo is working to protect.

Lastly, zoos provide a safe and controlled environment for researchers to study animals and their behavior. They can observe animals up close, collect data, and conduct experiments that would be impossible or dangerous in the wild. This research can help us better understand the animals' needs, behaviors, and how to protect them in their natural habitats.

In conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the welfare of animals in captivity, zoos play an essential role in conservation and education efforts. They provide a safe environment for endangered species to breed, educate the public about wildlife, and offer opportunities for researchers to study animals. Therefore, I believe that zoos should continue to operate, but with strict regulations and a focus on animal welfare.",,1.0
222796,"During the sucker, students across the world are given a break from school and the stress it entails. Although I believe sucker break is an important thing for students, it can also be harmful educationally. This is because when students take extended breaks from their regular education, they often tend to forget things regarding their previous curriculum, and this break can also Make it emotionally harder for students to return to school at the end of their sucker break. Schools who require their students to complete sucker projects have proved higher scores in student testing and graduation rates. I believe that these projects should be teacher designed rather than student designed. This is because teacher designed sucker projects would be More specific to curriculum, More educational, and More effective regarding preparation for the start of the school year, opposed to student designed projects.

To begin, I believe that teacher designed projects would be More specific to curriculum opposed to student designed projects. This is because teachers have further knowledge of upcoming curriculum while students do not. Therefore, the teacher designed projects would be More helpful in preparing a student for his or her upcoming classes. For example, if a teacher were to design a history project for a rising senior taking government for their next history class, the project would likely be based on a summary or unit in the students upcoming class. This project would be a simple way of preparing this student for their upcoming class and the curriculum it involves. If the student had designed the project themself, it Kay is on the wrong Lateral or Kay not be focused on important information they'll need during their upcoming school year. Although it is important to gain a basis of all knowledge, the More specific information a teacher would be able to demonstrate would be far More effective and helpful for a student in the long run.

Secondly, I believe that teacher designed projects would be far More educational than student designed projects during the sucker. This is because teachers have previously attended college and have earned degrees to professionally provide education to students. As experts in this field, a teacher would likely include More useful and informative information on a sucker project, thus Making the project far More effective. If a student were to design a project this could result in an activity that is not nearly as educational, helpful, and ultimately worthwhile. If there are More educational benefits included in sucker projects it can successfully provide an opportunity for students to learn and grow, while a student designed project Kay lack this needed education which could result in a class being too challenging, stressful, and this student having an ultimately harder school life.

Lastly, I strongly believe that teacher designed projects would be far More effective regarding preparation for the start of a students school year. Teachers are aware of the details included in certain classes, and they have knowledge of a lot More information about these courses than a student would. Although a student Kay effectively design a sucker project based on previously taken classes, I believe education can only be expanded through gaining More knowledge regarding future classes, and these projects would likely be More effective if they were focused More toward a student's upcoming schooling rather than their previous education. This would allow the student to be effectively prepared and ready for the new school year, and possibly More prepared for some challenging courses they Kay ends up taking in their future, whether that is in grade school or earning a More advance degree. Not only would the teacher designed project prepare the further, but it could also effectively Make their next school year less stressful and More comprehensible. The teacher designed project would not only prepare the for future education, but it could also prepare the for real world struggles. For example, if a teacher designed project ends up being challenging and stressful for a student, it will act as Any real life struggles. If this student were able to put hard work into completing this project, not only will they be further prepared educationally, but it could have the ability of showing the that life has challenges that Kay seek difficult but are never impossible.

As time passes and problems are thrown at us, it seeks as though young people are the one's with problem-solving ideas, and although I strongly stand by the idea of children and young people progressing our world, it is important that these students inquire the proper education to do so. That is why I believe that teacher designed sucker projects would be immensely More effective than student designed projects during the sucker. If students are able to complete these teacher designed sucker projects it could Make their schooling More effective, thus producing future societal contributors. These teacher designed projects could be a driving force in creating a problem solving adult who in the long run could change the future of our fast paced world and its Any obstacles.",,0.0

For some people it isn't a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. For example if I wanted to be a mechanic, I could take auto collision in edison, and that would start to help me out and give me experience.

Those question's can help you in the future if you use them. Knowing what you would like to do in the future can help you out because your school might have classes or after school club's for it.

Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. One of my goal's is to own my first car before I graduate which is a Lexus Is300 2001. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Setting goal's is important in life, and Ithink everyone should set some goal's for themselve's..

If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goal's for yourself, and once you reach those goal's set harder ones to reach. You can set goal's with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere.

If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday.

67208,By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you.

107836,"Do you believe it's fair for students to choose whatever project they want? Students shouldn't be able to choose their own project, because they could be choosing the easiest one or the least amount of work. They could also be doing something they've already done, so they wouldn't be learning anything new. Although some Light agree otherwise, personal experiences, other students, and teachers prove that students should not be choosing their soccer projects. .

For example, personal experiences, I've learned Core stuff through teacher designed soccer projects. When I was assigned a book to read over soccer, I thought it would be boring, and I wouldn't be able to finish it. The type of book that I had to read was not CY type, but I ended up loving it and was interested in finishing it. If CY teacher didn't assign this project to Ce I would have never found out I was interested in these types of books and I would have never learned some things not only from the book, but about Ce. Some Cay disagree with this, but teacher designed soccer projects help students be Core responsible and get the to learn Core information.

Shown through other students, some take advantage of teachers who give the a student designed project, and they choose something they really know and don't have to learn anything new. Some students don't like to learn anything or do anything related to school, and they end up choosing the easiest way out of that school work. In this case those students who didn't want to learn anything end up with less knowledge than others in their class. By giving the whole class the same soccer project, they will be all on the same page next year when they go over it and everyone will understand.

Lastly teachers, they all have a different Find set, so every teacher teaches differently. A teacher could be letting their student's do anything they want for a project in class, out of class, or for soccer. If one does do that, some student's Cay have a hard time and some Cay like it better that way and if they do the students Cay have a different amount of work on the projects which wouldn't be fair to the. Some Cay say otherwise; however, a teacher designed soccer project will help the students learn and help to be able to work on their own. This will also help they get ready for work, so they would be able to do things on their own.

This is important because some teachers don't think it affects students, but Cost of the time it does, students Cay take advantage with teachers providing a student designed soccer project. When a student was able to choose all of their past soccer projects and then one year they can't choose it. They would struggle and wouldn't have a teacher to help the because it's soccer time. If a student is able to choose their projects all the time they wouldn't be learning anything new. This explains why student's shouldn't be able to choose their soccer projects shown through personal experiences, other students, and teachers. ",,0.0

Students that are motivated and engaged in activities not only get better grades but also build strong relationships with their teachers, mentors, and peers.

At home, attitude is also important for maintaining relationships with family and friends. 

School is another area in life where attitude is particularly important, as it can determine how successful a student is. Attitude is an important charisma as it shapes our actions, outlook and decisions, which consequently affects how our peers and the world around us perceive us. Students with a positive attitude are more likely to be self-confident, organized and motivated individuals, which can be key in helping them reach their goals",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Furthermore, those who decide to save money by enrolling in a less expensive college for this fourth year could use this time to take more classes or get work experience.

However, graduating high school in three years could also have a negative impact on student life. Furthermore, students may be better prepared for college given the exposure to more challenging classes and the chance to complete appropriate coursework earlier.

This option could also benefit students’ extracurricular activities. With an accelerated timeline, students could move on to college a year earlier than their peers, freeing up time to partake in more campus activities or take on a summer internship. Without an additional year of high school, students may miss out on some of the traditional experiences, such as playing sports or attending school dances. 
Graduating high school in three years instead of four could provide students with several potential benefits. On the academic front, this would likely lead to a more advanced curriculum where students can cover more material in the span of three years as opposed to four",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

She always tells me that she was a high school kid at a point and she knows what its like and the problems kids might be going through, so that's why shes training to help them in making the right decisions. Sometimes it's good to take an experts advice in a matter like I was in, you don't always have to take their advice but its good to just talk to someone about it and keep in mind what they say for future references. For example my aunt is currently training to be a consular for high school kids and her goal is to gain the trust of her students so they can come to her when they need help. It's always good to talk to someone in case of an emergency. . I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. When I need help making a life decision about something like college I go to my consular who's been in college and knows what could be right for me, I always take in mind what they advice me and make a decision. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but it's always good to take advice from experts. It's always good to follow your own instincts but sometimes it's not. It doesn't always necessarily need to be help for an adult it can always be help from a sibling or other family member who has been through what you have and who you know will lead you in the right direction. Their are people who have experienced the same thing you might be going through right now and are certified or trained to help. That's why I believe that people should always try to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters.

53665,"Every student gets really impatient towards the end of the school year because summer vacation is just around the corner. Having to not do any school work for three months is a major blessing for students who are constantly surrounded by work. However, some schools require students to complete a summer project to assure they continue learning over their break.

Being assigned a project over your well-deserved vacation isn't the best thing to come across, but it'd be way better if you were in control of it. Summer projects should be student-designed because it would be based off of their interest, they'll know how to set it time for it, and they'll be more creative.

Doing a school related project based off of your interest can come with so many advantages that leads it to be successful. For example, if you play football and your project requires you to make a time line about one of your hobbies to see if you improved, you would most likely make your project about football. Your interest can make things way easier for you because you'll know what to accomplish. Also, if you're doing something that you like it won't necessarily be boring. For instance, when I was in tenth grade we were required to do a personal project about something we would want to show improvement in, since I knew that I haven't drawn in a while I decided that I wanted to improve in it. It makes your project easier and helps you to not over think about it.

Stressing out over summer vacation should never come upon anyone. Being a student with a summer project that they can design can help them manage their time. We all know that time management is important, especially when you have plenty of other things to do. It becomes a hassle when you have certain deadlines to reach when you're supposed to be on relaxing vacation. According to my friend, when she was in the CISL program at her school, she was required to do a project over summer that had deadlines for every target in her project. She was stressing so much that she wasn't able to meet most of those deadlines. That shows how much of a teacher designed project can make you not be successful and stressed out. However, if she were to do a student-designed project, there would be no hassle. Also, when students have plans for summer they'll be able to make time for their project because they know what to do and what not to do since they are in control of it.

Lastly, creativity is the most important factor of making a project. It shows the amount of effort put in to the project and since it is a student designed project, it would be more fun and interesting. For example, I did a project based off of my interest and since I was so focused in my project I made it look nice as possible. I cared about what my project was going to look like and how it was going to be presented because since I designed it every part of it would represent me and how much effort I put into my work. For example, if you are participating in a science fair, you would want your project or experiment to look presentable. That is why creativity will show throughout a project that the student designs.

Overall, having to do work over your summer vacation doesn't sound good, but if we were required to do a summer project, it'll be more beneficial to do a student-designed one rather than a teacher-designed project. Even though teachers have you meet certain requirements, students will be interested if they choose what they are doing. Also, it'll give less stress and more focus which is needed in order to make their project successful. It is better to be having fun on break rather than worrying if you met the teacher guidelines.      ",,0.0

When I was in my country many people came to the area where we live there was so many that your mind can't relate to what we see and we all were very nice to them and we gave them many of the things that we have and as much we can, There was so many kids from them I use to be realy sad when I see them like that I refused to give every thing I can to them but some of them was vrery hungry and some are mean but I said to my self in my mind that their impreesion won't be like that if they weren't in need like that. To see people's impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow people's impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation.

Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someone's story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when she's sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and see's her like that they say that she's wired from how she acts, but her first imression was't like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and we're a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that she's very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how she's diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. People's reactions might chang after an accident happen to some one's in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some one's reactions if we see them the next time or day. So to see people impression we have to see thier past and what they been throw, Many of them change there mood, and some might change after a prolem has been solved.. Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them.

So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me

""too mach agreement kills a chat"". and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some one's mind when they see some one impressions for the first time.

I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. To see someone impression, that might be possible to chang. Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when they're in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Furthermore, additional support can be provided by teachers, who can devote more time to helping students develop their understanding of the material. Additionally, a longer school day could require additional resources such as additional staff, facilities, books, and other materials. 
One potential benefit of having a longer school day for high school students is that they would have more time to learn the subject material. This could make it difficult for students to balance their school work with extracurricular activities and time to relax. 

On the other hand, there are some potential disadvantages associated with a longer school day. With the extra two hours, students could spend more time on the subjects of their choosing and focus more on making progress and improving their grades.

Second, some students don't want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early.

First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. Do you think a three month break is too long ? Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer.

In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Some says that when one is stress out, they can't think nor do things well. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school,

Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer.

376666,"Technology has revolutionized the way we interact with each other, but it has also had a significant impact on human contact. On the positive side, technology has made it easier for people to stay connected with each other, regardless of distance. With the rise of social media, messaging apps, and video conferencing, people can now communicate with friends and family members from all over the world in real-time. This has made it easier for people to maintain long distance relationships and to stay in touch with loved ones who live far away.

Another positive impact of technology on human contact is that it has made it easier for people to find and connect with like minded individuals. Online communities and social media groups allow people to find others who share their interests and passions, and to connect with them in meaningful ways. This has led to the formation of new friendships and even romantic relationships, as well as the strengthening of existing ones.

However, there are also negative impacts of technology on human contact. One of the biggest concerns is that technology has made it easier for people to become isolated and disconnected from others. Many people spend a significant amount of time on their devices, whether it's texting, scrolling through social media, or watching TV. This can lead to a lack of facetoface interaction and a feeling of loneliness and disconnection.

Another negative impact of technology on human contact is that it has made it easier for people to avoid difficult conversations and to communicate in a superficial way. With the rise of social media and messaging apps, people can easily avoid confrontation and simply ""unfriend"" or ""block"" someone if they don't want to talk to them. This can lead to a lack of meaningful communication and a lack of understanding between people.

In conclusion, technology has had both positive and negative impacts on human contact. While it has made it easier for people to stay connected and find like minded individuals, it has also led to increased isolation and superficial communication. It is important for individuals to be aware of these impacts and to strive for meaningful, facetoface interaction with others. This can help to build stronger relationships and to foster a sense of community and connection.",,1.0

With long distance learning that won't even be an issue. The students would also feel more comfortable in their own home. And there are many more benefits that come with long distance learning. For example, they could do it on their own time, this could be way for student to get ahead, because sometimes in classrooms kids feel that the paste is too slow. The kids that feel that the classes go too slow tend to get bored and boredom causes behavior problems, with online classes that won't be the case because it's at your own paste, they can go as fast as they want. Another benefit would be their eating schedule, typically eating in class is prohibited and that made students upset because theres no way they can control when they get hungry, At home they are free to have their regular eating schedule without it being a problem. Long distance learning also benefits the parents, Dropping off and picking up their children can be a hassle, attending online classes this issue is taken out of the picture completely.

"" A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.""

This new technology can help in so many ways. Us ourselves may or may not see how another person is feeling, we might think they are feeling happy but deep inside they can be sad. That's where the new technology part comes in, it is able to see what a person is truly feeling like for an example the Mona Lisa painting.

43484,"## The Advantages of Limiting Car Usage

In recent years, there has been a growing movement to limit car usage. This is due to a number of factors, including the environmental impact of cars, the high cost of owning and operating a car, and the negative effects of car-centric development on public health and quality of life.

There are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. For one, it can help to reduce air pollution. Cars are a major source of air pollution, which can cause respiratory problems, heart disease, and cancer. Limiting car usage can help to improve air quality and make cities healthier places to live.

Another advantage of limiting car usage is that it can help to reduce traffic congestion. Traffic congestion can cause delays, increase stress levels, and waste fuel. Limiting car usage can help to reduce traffic congestion and make it easier to get around.

In addition, limiting car usage can help to promote physical activity. Walking and biking are great ways to get exercise, and they can also help to reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. Limiting car usage can make it easier for people to walk and bike to their destinations, and this can lead to a healthier population.

Finally, limiting car usage can help to reduce urban sprawl. Car-centric development often leads to the construction of large, low-density suburbs that are far from jobs, schools, and other amenities. This can make it difficult for people to get around without a car, and it can also lead to increased traffic congestion and air pollution. Limiting car usage can help to support more compact, walkable, and bikeable communities.

In conclusion, there are a number of advantages to limiting car usage. It can help to reduce air pollution, reduce traffic congestion, promote physical activity, and reduce urban sprawl. These are all important reasons to consider limiting car usage, and there are a number of things that can be done to make it easier for people to get around without a car.

Here are some specific examples of things that can be done to make it easier for people to get around without a car:

* Improve public transportation. This can include making public transportation more affordable, reliable, and convenient.
* Build more bike lanes and sidewalks. This can make it safer and easier for people to walk and bike to their destinations.
* Promote car sharing and ride sharing. This can give people more options for getting around without having to own a car.
* Create more mixed-use communities. This can make it easier for people to live, work, and shop in the same area without having to rely on a car.

By taking these steps, we can make it easier for people to get around without a car, and this will have a number of benefits for the environment, our economy, and our quality of life.",,1.0
365279,"Dear senator,

I know you have a lot of things on your mind, but I really felt the need to address the way we vote for our president of the United States. Instead of using the Electoral College, I think we should select the president by popular vote. We, the people should be allowed to control who our president is and that not always likely to happen. We can't control whomever our electors vote for. If you keep reading you will see my reasoning for not favoring the Electoral College.

First, I favor changing to election by popular vote because of something we might call the ""disaster factor."" Us Americans should consider the fact about how back in 2000, there was one of the biggest fiascos of the century because of the election process. Just think about how state legislatures can just pick electors, and those electors they chose can defy the will of the people. Even if we go back even further to the 1960s the segregationists of the Louisiana legislatures almost succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new ones, who would oppose John F. Kennedy.

Yecondly, I would prefer that he election was decided by the popular vote because some people refuse to vote. ""These electors are called ""faithless"" electors. They refuse to vote for their party's candidate and cast a deciding vote for whomever they please"" stated in source 2: The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong, in paragraph 11.

Last but not least of all, the electoral college is unfair to voters. Only because of the winnwertakeall system in each state. Because of this system, candidates don't spend time in states they know don't have a chance of winning. They mainly focus on the tight races in the ""swing"" states. Back in 2000, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all, which is not right.

In conclusion, I would like to say that I would rather have the decision to vote for our president by using the most popular vote. I feel that we don't actually get to make the decision of who our president actually is. I would like to say that the electoral college is unfair, irrational and outdated.  All in all, My opinion is that Bob Dole was right: Abolish the electoral college! Any way I really hope you take this in consideration, not just for me, but for the people.

886953,"However taking classes from home wouldn't benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldn't have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they don't understand the material.

Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work.

Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.

I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.

On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates.           . Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period.

In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . Being home schooled you wouldn't have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too.

51902,"This also ties in with the importance of friendship and respect within a group, allowing individuals to understand and appreciate one another, creating a culture that is both cordial and productive. If left unchecked, this can lead to the erosion of one's personality and social relationships, making it hard to interact with others when the situation calls for it. 

Working with a group can be menacing and rewarding in equal measure. 

At the same time, working alone can be isolating and lonely, with individuals surrounded only by their own thoughts and beliefs. On one hand, it has the advantage of providing ideas, resources, and support, allowing individuals to learn and gain insight from one another. Working alone has the advantage of freeing an individual from feeling the pressure of being a part of a collective, and allows them to steer their own course without feeling like they have to meet anyone else's expectations. This synergistic relationship allows people to become their best, but can also lead to a feeling of being overwhelmed. While it may be tempting to stay isolated, there are undoubtedly great rewards to be found in working as a part of a collective, and the strength and support it provides can be invaluable.. 

In conclusion, there are advantages and disadvantages to working with a group and working alone, but it is important to examine the implications of each carefully and decide which method is best suited for the task at hand. Working as a group can be beneficial in difficult situations because it allows people the opportunity to pull together in times of need, utilizing a collective knowledge base to get the job done efficiently and effectively",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
30307," I strongly agree with Emerson's statement that ""I will grow every day, I do best in life."" Every day, I wake up with a clear goal in mind, whether it's to improve my grades in Algebra, enhance my English skills, or set a plan to become a doctor. I strive to achieve these goals by studying hard and working tirelessly towards them. While I may feel tired at times, I know that these goals are worth the effort, and I will continue to push forward until I reach them.

However, I do not agree with the idea that we must constantly challenge others to do better. While it is important to strive for personal growth and improvement, not everyone is ready or willing to take on new challenges. Some people may be content with their current job, school, and other activities, and that is perfectly acceptable. It is important to respect their choices and allow them to pursue their own paths in life.

In my case, I believe that I can achieve more by taking on new challenges and pushing myself to be the best version of myself. I am motivated to continue my education and progress in life by finding exciting things that I enjoy doing. Whether it's playing soccer or learning to sing, I believe that by pursuing these passions, I can achieve my goals and become a successful doctor.

I also believe that it is important to share my wisdom and experiences with others. By learning new things in life, we can gain valuable insights and knowledge that can be used to help others. I am excited about the opportunity to earn my High School Diploma and to continue my journey towards becoming a doctor.

Take the example of YouTube star, Pewdiepie, for example. Before achieving fame, Carrey was living in poverty. So, keep pushing through and tackling life head on. The people that do give up end up regretting it, while those who keep persevering can achieve the success they always wanted. His attempts at pursuing a higher education were thwarted, and he felt he had nowhere to go with his life. But Pewdiepie refused to give up. Through hard work, dedication, and a commitment to staying true to himself, he has since become the most subscribed YouTube channel in the world, amassing 86 million subscribers.

Another example of why people should not give up even when they feel they can’t go on lies in the inspiring story of Jim Carrey. Before his stardom, Pewdiepie felt like he had been defeated by the world. He didn’t allow his older circumstance to dictate his own future. People who have the courage to keep going, no matter what, are always able to reach great successes that they couldn’t have imagined reaching before. He could be found sleeping in his van or sending messages to casting agents at night. 
No matter how hard life may become, or how much it seems like you have been mastered in something, it is important to remember that it’s important to never give up. Instead, he pooled his resources to start his own YouTube channel, and went to work. You never know what amazing opportunities and successes might be waiting for you in the future..

Then we are true to ourselves, we are able to live our lives in a way that is authentic and meaningful, rather than trying to fit into a mold or conform to the expectations of others.

Then we are not living in accordance with our true selves, we may feel like we are not who we are or like we don't know who we are. This can be particularly difficult for young people who are still trying to figure out their identities.

Society can also have a significant impact on our ability to be true to ourselves. In many cases, society places a lot of pressure on individuals to conform to certain standards and expectations. For example, there may be expectations around appearance, behavior, and even beliefs. These expectations can make it difficult for people to be true to themselves, as they may feel like they don't fit into the mold that society has set out for them.

Our stance on the matter of self-reliance in humans stans to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. With self-reliance, one is more keen on their own inabillities and strives to problem solve with a more in-depth and notable understanding..

Not only can a career guide help students explore and find opportunities that align with their interests and goals, but they can also provide guidance on cheaper academic alternatives to college. It is important to research how students with and without access to career guides have experienced different outcomes in their lives and explore how schools can give more students the opportunity to pursue the careers they want.

This could prevent teenagers from getting in trouble and prevent people from cleaning up the teenagers own mess. It's also your job as parents to keep watch out on your son or daughter because they can try sneaking out. For an example, if your teenager stays home and doesn't go out passed his curfew then he or she won't get hurt or even worse shot by a dangerous person . I suggest buying a ton of paper or objects that you can paint on instead of doing graffiti on buildings or walls own from the city council. You won't have to worry about them that much because you know they are safe at home and won't try to get you in a serious problem. This is for the teenagers to be safe and not be out late because something could happen to them if they are out on the streets at night. To demonstrate, If your teenager is not out on the street then he or she can be drawing or painting on paper instead of doing graffiti on building or walls . The curfew rule is an outstanding rule and I think more city councils should adopt it as well.. This rule can prevent anything dangerous happening to your son or daughter, this will keep them inside and they can study, catch up on miscomplete assignments , and do homework. The city council is debating on having curfews for teenagers, weekdays they have until 10 p. If your teenager is caught doing this , he or she is gonna be in a serious problem and they will have to clean it.

My final reason why I think it's important to have a curfew rule is because this will prevent your teenager from doing illegal things such as drinking or doing drugs. For an example ,If your teenager was caught doing illegal things and doing it passed curfew , it would be extremely terrible and your teenager would be in a whole lot of trouble. This keeps our kid safe and also out of trouble because its horrible to be drinking and doing drugs. Instead of doing those things , just talk to your loved ones, friends, and family on the phone or play with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

As a result, having a curfew on weekdays and weekends is important because this could prevent anything from happening to your teenager. I do not think they interfere with young peoples life but keep them safe from anything happening to them , keep them from breaking the laws and getting in trouble by the police .My three main reasons from having a curfew were to keep them from doing anything illegal, to keep them from getting hurt or killed,

to keep them from doing graffiti on buildings and walls, and makes the parent communicate with the teenager and see what they are doing .One last important thing is to always communicate with your teenager because they want your help but deep down they won't ask for it , so it's important to check up on them once an awhile and see how they are doing.

This is why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule . This rule won't interfere with young peoples life, it would keep them safe at home and their parents don't have to worry about them doing anything bad. If the city council adopt the curfew rule they can prevent your son or daughter from getting beat up or getting shot . The teenagers can be talking to their friends, loved ones, and family on their phone or be playing with them on PlayStation or Xbox.

My first reason why I think they should the adopt the curfew rule is because it keeps them at home and keeps them safe. This is why having a curfew and checking on your kids room once in awhile will help you prevent this from happening and also keep your teenager from having a black out, crashing or a overdose. We don't know what our kid could be doing passed curfew so I think we need this curfew so we can make sure they are not doing anything illegal. If your teenager has some bad friends, tell your kid to stop talking to them because they might try forcing him or her to do something that they do not want to do. The city council can't really do anything about your teenager sneaking out from your house so you are responsible for watching your kid.

My second reason why I think the city council should adopt the curfew rule is to keep your teenager from breaking the law and to keep them from doing horrible things. If you have talent to draw amazing objects then try showing it in school or on your personal items and not on the cities property",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
339683,"Considering To Change The Average To Play Sports

I think we shouldn't have to have a c average because grades shouldn't affect our sports because our grades don't have anything to do with the way we play sports. We should get to do many activities without having to have a one specific grade because we are all different and some may not be as smart as others, but that doesn't mean we can't play that sport because we aren't as smart as the other students.

We should be able to do anything anyone can do without having to have a b average I could kind of understand lower than a c average because that person wasn't try enough or there best. Lut as long as we have at least a c average we should be able to play the same sport as someone with a b average or an average. Like my friend is not so smart, but she loves basketball, and she is perfect at it, she beats me every time, but she doesn't have the best grades, so she can't play, so no one would never no how good she was except for maybe when we have gym.

My personal opinion is we shouldn't make a change in that we shouldn't have to have a b average because some people don't have the best grades they could get. Some people want to be pros at a sport and that's what they want to do for the rest of there life, and they can't because of their grade because they never got a chance to and if they did do the sport and was good at it then they would know they had to pull there grade up.",,0.0

Despite his happiness in his job and consistent success, he felt a nagging feeling that he wanted to try something different. The statement “Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow in life” is certainly true—at least for John.. So he decided to take a risk and enrolled in a course in web-design, something which he had never tried before. Take, for instance, the story of John, a successful web-developer who had been working in the same position for the past five years. 
One need not look very far to find proof of the concept that growth can only happen if one is willing to step out of their comfort zone and try something new and challenging. Though the course was challenging and he had to put in a lot of extra effort, he eventually found success and was able to switch to a new career working in web-design.

But Venus has also the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system even though Mercury is the closer to the sun. Beyond high pressure and heat Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanos, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes seeking to land on it's surface The value of returning to Venus seems indisputable because Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life just like Earth, but today Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on earth. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has one particularly competing idea for sending human to study Venus and there is no easy conditions but survivable for humans. Also, human curiosity will likely lead them into many equally intimidating endeavors and their travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation and that's why I think that this challenge is interesting for people to study it.",,0.0
32615,"Title: The Face on Mars: A Mystery Uncovered

Introduction:

Imagine looking up at a distant planet, Mars, with a telescope and suddenly noticing an unmistakable human-like face staring back at you. That is precisely what happened to the American space program in 1976 when the Viking 1 spacecraft captured an image of what appeared to be the face of a giant on Mars. The image went viral, and people around the globe became fascinated by the possibility of extraterrestrial life. However, after years of research and scientific analysis, the face on Mars turned out to be nothing more than an optical illusion created by geological processes on the Martian surface. Let's explore the mystery behind this intriguing phenomenon.
The Discovery:
It all began on July 25, 1976, when the Viking 1 orbiter captured an image of Cydonia Mensae, an area in Mars's northern hemisphere known for its unique rock formations and terrain. The image showed a mesa, a flat-topped hill, with a distinctive formation resembling a human face. This discovery quickly sparked public interest and speculation about the possibility of extraterrestrial life.
The Debate:
Scientists were divided on the interpretation of the face on Mars. Some believed it might be an artificial structure, possibly created by an advanced civilization. Others believed it was a natural geological formation that, due to the unique shape of the mesa and the lighting conditions, resembled a human face. To further investigate the matter, the NASA team conducted more observations and sent additional images and data from the Viking 1 lander.
Analysis:
Following the initial excitement, scientists began to analyze the images more closely. They discovered that the ""face"" was part of a larger formation, which also included two ""pyramids"" nearby. This led to the hypothesis that the face was a result of natural processes like erosion and weathering. Furthermore, they found that the ""nose"" and ""mouth"" were actually fissures, or cracks, in the rock formation. These cracks could have been formed due to a variety of natural factors such as thermal stress, wind erosion, or the impact of meteorites.
Conclusion:
After decades of research and analysis, scientists have come to a consensus that the face on Mars was nothing more than an optical illusion created by the geological processes at work on the Red Planet. Although the initial discovery sparked excitement and debate about the possibility of life on Mars, the scientific investigation revealed that this was just an intriguing example of the natural wonders present in our solar system. The face on Mars serves as a reminder that, even in the vast emptiness of space, nature can sometimes conjure up images that resemble familiar shapes and forms.",,1.0
84497,"Education has traditionally been in a classroom environment, usually with a teacher or educator helping students learn by explaining and showing examples of problems. As the use of technology becomes more widespread, so does its use in the classroom, with computers and projectors as prime examples. Given that education is the foundation of many cultures and civilizations, it is important that students are provided the tools necessary for them to learn all that they desire. Distance learning, however, is counterintuitive and takes away a lot of the tools used by students and teachers. Attending classes from home would not benefit students in learning and comprehending what they are taught.

Distance learning would not benefit students because it relies on the individual being able to be more independent than they would normally be in a traditional classroom. A staple of successful education is having peers and extra resources to help answer questions as well as provide a different viewpoint of a topic. If a student is struggling while video conferencing with a teacher, the teacher can only provide a certain amount of help; the student would not be able to ask his desk buddy, as they would be alone at home. Meanwhile, in a classroom, there are many students who struggle initially yet can rely on their teacher, peers, after school help, and online resources that the institution has to offer.

Another reason distance learning is not reliable is because there is a barrier of communication. At the minimum, a computer is needed to access the website or call the educator. Not every student has access to a computer as frequently as needed. Students with computers have to ensure that it does not break, and a stable connection is upheld, which can never be guaranteed. A simple water spill can damage the computer, and students would be without access to schooling until they acquire a new way to access the learning module or have to enroll in an institution anyway, which renders online courses useless at that point.

Finally, a very important aspect of going to school every morning is being held accountable. With the idea of distance learning, another necessary factor is that the student will do the work assigned to them. If the student is left home after his parents leave for work, nothing is stopping them from simply not logging on to their learning module that day. Contrary to what most children in an institution may say, most of them would not be as happy as they are if they did not attend school. Students wake up in the morning to go to school because there are safeguards making sure they do, such as parents being able to check grades, friends who can only be seen at school and persuade them to come, and school regulations requiring a certain attendance to graduate.

Traditional classroom settings and institutions of learning already have well-documented systems that account for any gaps in the learning process. Distance learning relies on multiple factors that cannot always be controlled, such as individual knowledge, access to a reliable computer, and accountability. It is counterintuitive because it allows the same problems that traditional institutions have fixed to be exploited again. There have been countless generations who have learned without the online aspect, and it is obvious society does not rely upon distance learning as it only became available recently. Student education and comprehension should be prioritized, and distance learning will not benefit students nor help them learn as well as they can.",,0.0

Honesty is an important part of every successful relationship. When honesty is taken too far, it can start to look like criticism and can damage relationships that were built on trust and respect. Therefore, in relationships it is important to weigh the consequences of any decision before making them.. 

In conclusion, always being honest with friends and family can have both pros and cons. Always being honest with your friends and family can help create trust and create long-lasting relationships. 

On the other hand, being honest with loved ones comes with a risk factor. On the other hand, being too honest and blunt without considering the consequences of your words can mean hurting those you care about the most. While it can lead to better understanding between relationships and create an atmosphere of trust and respect, it can also come with a risk factor of hurting relationships and feelings. Being proactive and honest with one another helps build trust right away and it can lead to stronger bonds between those involved. Additionally, honesty in relationships can also cause discomfort while talking about delicate matters. 

The pros of always being honest with friends and family include being able to stay genuine, creating an atmosphere of trust and respect among relationships, and understanding the true intentions of others.

To drive this point home, let us look at some inspiring examples of how enthusiasm has helped people or organizations to achieve great success.

One example can be seen in the rise of tech giants like Apple or Microsoft. 
Enthusiasm has long been seen as an important factor in achieving success. It can help drive an individual or an organization to work towards their goal with dedication, until they finally obtain the success that they are aiming for.. To do so, they had to work with enthusiasm and dedication to build their products and bring them to the market. After all, it's great to have a goal of succeeding, but it takes enthusiasm and passion to actually take the steps necessary to reach that success. 

Successful entrepreneurs and philanthropists are also an example of how enthusiasm can lead to success. Their enthusiasm and hard work paid off, and now Apple and Microsoft are among the most successful and well-known companies in the world. For instance, Bill Gates devoted himself to his charitable work with immense enthusiasm and his organization has contributed immensely to the betterment of society. This shows that success is not always correlated to fame and fortune, but rather to how much effort someone can put in with enthusiasm.

Clearly, the examples provided here are only a few of many. Nevertheless, it is clear that having enthusiasm and passion is a key ingredient for success.

During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer.

Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die.

179151,"Online Schooling vs. Traditional Schooling: A Debate

As an 8th grader, I have had the opportunity to experience both online schooling and traditional in-person schooling. While both methods have their pros and cons, I believe that online schooling is the way of the future. In this essay, I will argue that online schooling provides more flexibility and personalization, while also offering different ways for students to receive the help they need. However, I also acknowledge that online schooling can have its drawbacks, such as struggling to understand the material or forgetting assignments due to lack of reminders.

One of the biggest advantages of online schooling is the flexibility it provides. With online classes, students can learn at their own pace and on their own schedule. This is particularly helpful for students who have busy schedules or who live in remote areas where access to traditional schools is limited. Online schooling also allows for more personalization, as teachers can tailor the material to each student's needs and learning style. This can lead to a more effective learning experience and better academic performance.

Another benefit of online schooling is the different ways students can receive help. With traditional in-person schooling, students may struggle to get the help they need, especially if they are shy or have difficulty asking questions. However, with online schooling, students can receive help through various means, such as online tutoring, discussion forums, and virtual office hours. These resources provide students with additional support and can help them stay on track with their coursework.

Despite the many benefits of online schooling, there are also potential problems that students may experience. One of the main concerns is struggling to understand the material. Without the face-to-face interaction with teachers and peers, students may find it harder to grasp complex concepts or ask for help when they need it. Additionally, students may forget assignments or miss deadlines due to a lack of reminders or organization tools.

However, I believe that these problems can be mitigated with proper planning and implementation. For example, teachers can use multimedia tools to provide interactive and engaging lessons, and parents can help their children stay organized and motivated. Additionally, online schooling platforms can provide built-in reminders and organization tools to help students stay on track.",,1.0

Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living.

Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time.

The debate on allowing cell phones in school should consider the respective pros and cons, as well as the potential solutions to effectively manage the devices' use in an educational setting. Banning cell phones completely might be too extreme if the main concern is misuse, as confiscating them away from students would not hold oneself accountable to foster responsible behaviors. 

The prevalence of cell phones in school also gives rise to the use of alternative solutions, such as filtering applications and messaging services that limit distractions and inappropriate media access.

By studying how to effectively manage the use of cell phones in an educational setting, and by implementing appropriate policies, we can ensure a safe and responsible learning environment for our students.. On the other hand, the use of cell phones in school can be distracting to students, and their misuse can result in cheating on exams and cyberbullying. An alternate approach could be to allow the use of cell phones under teacher supervision, emphasizing the importance of appropriate usage in the classroom as a digital literacy skill and through the use of classroom policies. It is also important to consider making resources available for students to learn proper internet safety, and for teachers to understand and accommodate the devices' use in the classroom",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Obtaing a good education might encourage students to be succsessfuly in other classes and in other places.. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future. Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. Elective classes are chosen by student who are intresting to be part of it. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Many students

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class .

When making decisions for ourselves, we are able to avoid external influences and biases that may not work in our best interest. We can also be more reliable in trusting our own judgment, as we are better-positioned to understand our own needs and desires than anyone else. 

In addition, by making our own decisions we are able to learn from past mistakes. When we make decisions based on our own perspective and understanding, we can easily see why something didn't turn out in the way we had planned and make corrections accordingly. This helps us to continue to grow and develop, rather than rely on other people to tell us what to do. 

Ultimately, when people make their own decisions, they gain more confidence and a greater sense of personal satisfaction. This will increase their motivation, enabling them to continue reaching higher and higher goals. In the end, making your own decisions is the key to taking control of your life and your future.",,1.0

It is a difficult process, but a rewarding one, and it takes immense strength and courage to be able to resist the urge to conform.

In a way, Emerson’s quote serves as a reminder that one should strive to be the best version of oneself and never lose sight of the unique individual qualities that make oneself special and entire. In today’s world, one is constantly bombarded with various pressures and expectations, such as achieving certain goals, getting into certain colleges, or succeeding in particular career paths. At the same time, it also serves as a source of celebration for anyone who has gone through their own valiant journey to stay true to themselves and their larger goals in the face of challenges.. Although these expectations can be beneficial in pushing individuals to reach their goals, oftentimes, it can be immensely difficult to stand out and remain true to oneself amidst these pressures.

For those who take the initiative to forge their own path and not get trapped by feeling the need to be the same as everyone else, it is a great accomplishment.

One of the most famous individuals who has achieved success by being unapologetically themselves is Ellen DeGeneres. Despite the risks and pressures of society, it is essential to embrace one’s own unique qualities and dreams. Being true to yourself requires the courage to face fears and reject the expectations placed on us by society. Only then can one discover true freedom and success.. This demonstrates the risk-benefit of wanting to be just like someone else versus following the crowd. DeGeneres never shied away from showing who she truly is, despite the risk that it could have cost her endorsements and fans. 

Author Ralph Waldo Emerson’s advice concerning the importance of being yourself has been echoed throughout the years. DeGeneres courageously came out as a lesbian on her show in 1997, setting an example for many people to follow. 

In conclusion, the importance of being yourself should never be underestimated. He states, ""to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" 

Surprisingly, the most important requirement for achieving success in life is much less complicated than trying to be just like someone else or following the crowd. It is to be true to yourself—take the path that is unique to you. By being honest with yourself and setting your own expectations, you can be content with who you are and discover the valuable role that you can play in improving the world.

Many cars are already caving many problems so way make a cart cat can drive its self? We could fix the problems in today's cars instead of worrying about trying to bring something new.

84595,"Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to express my concerns about the proposed policy change that would require students to maintain at least a grade B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While having good grades is important, I do not think imposing such a strict requirement is fair or will have the intended effect. 

Requiring a B average will eliminate participation for many students who currently have a C average. These students work hard in school as well as in their activities, and taking activities away could negatively impact their motivation and academic performance. Activities provide an important outlet and are beneficial for students' physical, mental and social well-being. Without this outlet, some students may feel more stressed and less engaged, leading their grades to suffer instead of improve. 

A C average already shows that students are passing their classes and making an effort. Having a C reflects room for improvement, but not a lack of effort or commitment. Activities teach valuable life lessons and can help reinforce lessons learned in the classroom. Cutting students off from these learning opportunities may do more harm than good when it comes to their overall development and success in school. 

A B average is also a very high bar that will exclude dedicated and hard-working students who happen to struggle more in certain subjects due to learning differences or challenges outside of school. This “one size fits all” approach does not consider individual student circumstances and needs. A more balanced approach, such as requiring a C average but developing targeted academic support for those close to failing, would be fairer while still promoting academic achievement. 

In closing, while the intent of raising standards is understandable, an inflexible B average requirement will negatively impact many deserving students without necessarily improving motivation or performance. I urge you to reconsider and suggested a more moderate, customized approach that supports all students’ well-being and success. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your name]",,1.0
964073,"In this case, failure is a great thing. Everyone knows the saying ""You learn from your mistakes"". If not then nobody will be able to meet the goal of success they want. Use failure as motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have an experience. Turns out that it is the opposite. Can failure lead to success?

Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

Many people who have dreams and goals would agree.

If failure is on the road to success it will give motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have experience.

Failure doesn't always have to be a bad thing.

Failure will give people that push of motivation many need. As soon as failure kick's in, so should the motivation. . Having that experience of failure will help.

When the goal is met and finally succeeded then there will be an amazing story to tell. Don't sit there and give up because failing is a way closer to the goal. Are many people just going to give up because they failed one time? Let's say somebody is setting a high goal and fail; if that person sets a high goal they will have to understand failure will come in some part of that; it is a reach to get there. That saying is very true.

If something goes wrong because the way it was dealt with, will the same mistake happen again? Of course not! People see when the mess up or fail after it happens and will try to do better.

That is improvement and it's leading you to success.

Then we will know where to start and where to fix things.

It's apart of succeeding. Speak on the obstacles that were faced and how to get through without giving up. Having this experience and speaking about it can influence others as well. She has the chance to retake it and is taking the chance. That doesn't mean eventually the expectation won't get met.

It just means to keep trying.

Another reason on why failure can bring success is because it gives thought of improvement. Especially because failure was around. Maybe some people also have failed but they want to give up, encourage others that failing doesn't mean you still can't succeed.

To conclude, failure can be a big step to success if used the right way. People who have succeeded can tell others than without at least one fail, they would not of made it to where they are now.

Last but not least, it gives you experience.

If we didn't fail there would be no experience for the next goal. If students fail once then they know they have to get up and keep trying. For example,student is walking into class and spent the whole night studying for this test.

I talked to a close friend who was very passionate about theater and I could see that they wanted to encourage me to audition, but I couldn't work up the courage to actually do it. 
My essay will be about a situation two years ago when I was a junior in high school. If I had pushed myself to step outside my comfort zone, I believe I could have achieved success.

If I had made a different decision two years ago and taken the risk of auditioning, it is possible that I could have gained a greater understanding of theater and my own skillset. I had been very interested in the school's theater department, but I was too intimidated to audition for any shows. I knew that if I auditioned, I would likely be cast in a smaller role, and I was afraid I wouldn't do well enough. Instead, I remained in my comfort zone, and my hesitation to take the risk caused me to remain inthat area and to miss out on an amazing opportunity.. In addition, my friend would have likely been proud to see me giving it my all and succeeding. My lack of self-confidence kept me from taking action and kept me from fulfilling a potential passion",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

I think that it was not Generic_Name's fault for not attending school on time. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the school's free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.

Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. Wouldn't it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning.

Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning.

In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. My cousin didn't like school at all. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. My cousin's grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class.

It could also provide students who are unwell with healthier and nutritious meals, give students participating in school sports the nutritional requirements for their sport, and provide those who may be going hungry with a balanced and nutritious diet. Finally, students who may not be receiving enough nutrients or variety at home could receive the necessary vitamins and minerals that their bodies need for growth.

The advantages of changing the school lunch menu are extensive. 
The topic of changing the school lunch menu is highly important, and carries with it a variety of advantages for students.

On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. It could be you influencing someone else or someone influcing you.. I think being an example is something good as long as you don't do what they did wrong.

In conclusion, I think there are more ways to influence people. People think sometimes that influencing means you have to be an example for the person, but in my opinion influencing someone could be through anything like : internet, words, a friend and even family. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it.

Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said,  Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing.

Summer break has long been a staple of the school year for students and is widely viewed as an important facet of traditional education. On the one hand, there are many benefits to having a summer break. For example, after spending a long school year focusing their energies on their studies, the break allows students to rest and recuperate, helping them to re-energize and avoid burnout. Studies have shown, however, that the impact of the summer vacation on student achievement is modest and that, overall, the positive effects of having a break outweigh the negatives.. Furthermore, students can use the break to engage in activities which supplement their education, such as volunteering, attending summer camps, or taking classes that their school doesn't offer",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In his famous quote, Thomas Jefferson says that ""Labor is Prior to and Independent of Capital. This idea can be applied to various practical scenarios. In addition, in a student's academic journey, being idle will prevent them from achieving their educational goals, so it is important to stay focused and motivated. Ultimately, Jefferson's quote holds true - labor is essential and being idle will prove to be ineffective in practical scenarios.. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality.

On the other hand, although graduating early will help save money, students who choose this route may not have had the opportunity to take as many classes as those who completed the traditional four years. Graduating early also allows for increased college course work in the remaining time, giving students the opportunity to impress college admissions offices. Ultimately, the decision is a personal one and should be taken into consideration with care.. The most significant advantage is cost savings; students can save up to half a year's tuition by graduating in three years compared to four. It may be easier to get ahead in college preparedness through a three year plan, while maintaining the full high school experience and taking all the available classes may be the best fit for others. 
For students considering graduating high school in less than the traditional four year time frame, there are several advantages and disadvantages of that choice to consider. Additionally, graduating in three years may leave students feeling as though they are missing out on a major part of their high school experience in the form of sports teams, clubs, and other activities.

This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. One of the reasons were for research purposes. From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on people's lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient.

One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on people's lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.                 . Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. For example, many custom equipment's and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it.

Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work.

Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information.

Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. Many schools started providing laptops and iPad's to students who are unable to connect online. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world.

Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

On the other hand, individual work has its own advantages. Working independently allows students to explore topics more deeply and have the flexibility to try different angles and approaches.

sincerely, STUDENT_NAME. But also many students have a grade of a (C) or lower it would not be a good idea changing the policy sport grade for those students. This change would not effect much but for students who don't study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sport's but can't play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits.

Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better.

We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things . When you dont know how to do something it's frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. Such as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people

In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning.

My first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class.

My second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need.            . There is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .They can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if it's for educational purpose.

I think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and that's what make cellphones a bad opction.

Some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. Students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes.

Allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. Also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed .

My third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource.

Some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Recent research has shown that older students in school can have a positive influence on younger students. Furthermore, the older student's presence in helping with service hours can give younger students a sense of purpose. With the sense of responsibility they get from helping, young students may become more invested in their school and academic work. For example, by providing guidance and advice, the older student can help lead a younger student through difficult subject matter or give them encouragement and direction when it comes to their academic work. Additionally, there has been evidence that older students can act as mentors for younger students in areas where the older students have struggled themselves. All in all, having older students provide guidance and leadership to younger students in a school setting can have a number of positive effects.. This allows the younger students to relate to the situations better, trust the advice given and be more willing to try the tasks themselves",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
40172,"I believe that dress codes are a beneficial thing to have in schools because it helps create a positive learning environment. One of the main reasons why a dress code is beneficial is because it helps eliminate distractions in the classroom. For example, if students were allowed to wear whatever they wanted, they might wear something that is inappropriate or revealing which would cause distractions for other students.

Another reason why a dress code is beneficial is because it promotes unity and equality among students. When everyone is dressed the same, it helps students focus on their studies rather than their clothes. This also helps eliminate the pressure for students to keep up with the latest fashion trends, which can be expensive for some students.

Finally, dress codes can also help prepare students for the future. When students enter the workforce, most jobs will have a dress code in place. By enforcing a dress code in schools, students will become accustomed to dressing appropriately and professionally, which will be a useful skill in the future.

In conclusion, while some students may not like having to follow a dress code, I believe that it is ultimately a good thing for schools. Dress codes eliminate distractions, promote unity, and prepare students for the future. By enforcing a dress code, schools can help create a positive learning environment for all students.",,1.0

And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? that's is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldn't go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.

In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.

After years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Your positive attitude will not take you anywhere. A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life.       . After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.

You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life.

You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Therefore, it is important to recognize the indicators of a negative attitude, such as feeling discouraged or pessimistic, and develop strategies to reverse it. Examples of how a positive attitude can be beneficial in difficult situations include learning how to stay calm, looking for opportunities in adversity, and using positive language. Research has shown that the power of positivity can help propel a person towards their goals and allow them to lead a happier and more meaningful life. Having a positive outlook not only helps increase motivation, but it can also help us to handle difficult situations more effectively and look for solutions rather than dwell on the negatives.  With a positive attitude and continued dedication, many seemingly impossible goals can be achieved.. 
When it comes tocharting a successful path in life, having a positive attitude is one of the most important tools you can possess. Additionally, in order to achieve goals, it is important to focus on the overall goal rather than on small failures along the way, and to maintain a mindset that is open to learning and is driven by enthusiasm.

461436,"It is good in many reasons to keep a good average, because then they get their report card or their progress reports and they see that they have a low average, it is going to be because they are focusing to much in their sports or activities. It doesn't matter if they have a high C, but then need to have a B. Back to the point it will be challenging, but I'm sure the students that love playing sports or being part of school activities, those people will actually try and make those grades, but if for some reason, those people who tried their best, like they went to tutoring, did all their home and school work, and turned it in, then you might want to check in with his/her teachers and see if they want to let them participate, but everyone can make at least a B, not an A but a B, because we all are very smart, some smart as others, but yes I'm sure, it will all work out, but if they keep on complaining, and they don't actually try to do their best, and they slack off, go to sleep in class they you won't see a difference n their grades, then that's their lost, because we want our school to be recognized, with all of out players with a B. As i told you before, everyone is smart enough to pass their grades, even if, they don't think so.

It wont be so bad, either, to try your best at school, even if you just do it for sports, but i you were the type of person that was failing, then now you can say that you are passing all of your classes, don't think of what other people have to say, just do it for yourself.. Also they have to focus on their school work first than the sports, and like I said before playing sports might get them failing. Also, if nobody is making a change, on their grades than maybe she could change it but, meanwhile she should keep it to a b average to play any sports or to be in any activity, the students are going to try their best at making good grades to play sports. The principle should first see how the students react to the changing, and if it works than, yea keep it, but she can always change it. Most students would argue about having to study, but i think its for their own good, also the school will change, for example, the school recognized for having a C average ad letting them play sports or do any activities, that could change if the students try hard enough and change the C to a B, then the school will recognized by having a B average on, most of the students.

The reason that its best for students to have good grades, its because also at the end of the year if they don't have a good average, they will not be able to pass the year. one of the reasons why i want the students to have a good average, its because, those who want to succeed will try until they get it right, but if you are the person who doesn't care, then whose fault is that?

So i would like to have that policy. Dear Principle,

changing the policy is a good idea, because many people have c average, and if they play any sports, they might get a lower average than a c",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Steven Spielberg was turned down by the University of Southern California’s film school three times, and was rejected from Universal Studios numerous times before making his first feature-length film. 

These examples demonstrate that Churchill's statement holds true: it is only through the courage to continue, even in the face of failure, that success can be achieved.. 

Similarly, the film industry is filled with stories of those who found success after a history of failure. 

Take, for example, Thomas Edison's lightbulb. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” After thousands of trials and errors, Edison eventually achieved success. 
Winston Churchill once famously stated, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts.” Churchill's words provide a great reminder of the importance of failure in achieving success.

It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it.

We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes won't be electives to select student's natural abilities; a huge students, who aren't serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. It's a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who won't spend time to practice it.

Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they can't locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they don't waste time in the block they even aren't interested in. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying .     . Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time.

To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure.

42589,"Identifying a career at a young age.

Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesn't even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking.

Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think i'm already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I don't need to go school again just to spend money ,I'm good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didn't talk to him about careers when he was at school.

One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,that's why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career.

Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids I'm not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didn't have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didn't have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesn't have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work

In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Students could have more fun creating their own projects. A student can look up science experiments to do as their projects that could be entrusting for the class or for them selves to. Students will be able to work on a project without having to stress about it being perfect or if its following the checklist. Students could in joy doing work that doesn't have to follow a checklist.

Lastly students can feel less stress about doing a project. Students can come up with really creative work if you let them free roam. Also they can talk about a famous person or about someone in their family and explain why they wrote about that person. I think students should come up with their own summer projects design because, students can come up with really creative projects, could have more fun doing their own design projects,and will have less stress over the summer.

Students can come up with really creative projects over summer by researching experiments, or about someones life. Students can come up with their own checklist and show their classmates how they came up with it so the other students can do it one day for fun.

In conclusion, distance learning is a beneficial and valuable resource for students with disabilities or students who may not feel like they fit into traditional school. This can provide a sense of control for students with disabilities, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that works best for them. 

In addition, distance learning programs provide personalized instruction suited to each student's individual needs. 
Distance learning has been an attractive option for many students who have disabilities or who don't enjoy traditional school. With greater access, personalization, and autonomy, these students can gain the education and confidence they need to flourish.. With online teachers readily available to offer help and assistance when needed, students can tailor their learning experience to their own strengths and weaknesses. 

Finally, distance learning gives students with disabilities more autonomy and independence. Instead, they can learn on their own time, on their own terms, reducing feelings of helplessness and frustration. 

The benefits of distance learning for students with disabilities are numerous and include increased access to educational materials, personalized instruction, and a greater sense of independence. It allows these students to access educational opportunities without having to navigate the many obstacles they often face in a physical classroom setting.

Growing up, I always knew I had to be my own person. It was comforting to know that I had people who had my back no matter what path I chose.

Though there were times when I felt overwhelmed by the pressure of being myself, I eventually found the strength to overcome all the obstacles. I also leaned on the support of my friends and family. Being independent gave me the confidence to take risks and go after what I wanted. There were many times when I felt like giving up or when I was facing a difficult challenge, but I learned to draw strength from within myself.

When it came to the challenges of being myself and following my own path, I found it essential to practice self-care. Through dedication and hard work, I learned to accept and embrace myself for who I am. This included getting enough rest, being mindful of my emotions, and practicing healthy habits. In the end, learning to be independent and following my own path has been one of the best decisions I have ever made.. I realized that I was capable of facing any challenge that came my way.

Whether it was the challenge of striking out on my own or finding a career path of my own choosing, I learned to take charge of my life and be independent.

Also I experence more new thing in my normal school like being part of a band, playing for the school soccer team,being part of the drill team enjoying school like kids shoud do.

In my point of view student should not attend to year-round school because some students have part time job,it too expensive attend at year-round schools , and some students plan family vacation out of the country to spend time together.

But having this year-round school some students retain more information and stay focus to learn more information. Also by not attending to year-round schools some students have more life experience and become responsible in life.

In conclusion i consider students should attend to normal schools because they are less expensive,students can have a part time job, and also have some more life experience to help them become more responsible persons. Also it was too expensive,and students did not spend time with family, all kids do is attend to school all year.

After me and my brothers finish up are year in that school, my parents decided to move us to a normal school to spend more time in home, and have more life experience. My parents wonted the best for me and my brothers, so we attended to a year -round school.     . Should students attend to year-round schools?

Considering year-road schools they are good for students to attend too because they retain more information,students stay in school,and become more responsible students.

In my point of view, I think they are too expensive,students do not spent time with family or friends,and dont have the opportunity to have new experiences in life; for example having a summer job.

For example the experience I had in life with year-round schools was in Generic_City, when I lived their with my family for over ten years after living in the United States for nine years for my life; and for my parents for over twenty year of living in the United States; moving to Generic_City was a big change of life to my family.

However, there are also potential disadvantages to consider. Many students and parents may dislike the lack of extended summer vacation often associated with year-round school. While it offers some potential advantages, there are also potential disadvantages to consider.

Advantages of year-round school include the potential to reduce summer learning loss. Students who attend year-round schools experience shorter breaks throughout the year, which allows them to maintain more of the knowledge they acquire during the school year. Additionally, such a schedule could make it more difficult for students and their families to schedule or participate in summer activities or travel during long breaks.

Ultimately, considering the advantages and disadvantages associated with year-round schooling is essential for school districts and families to make an informed decision..

Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.

However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.

I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.

Group work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out. Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.

Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Overall, an extended school day has the potential to positively impact a student's academic performance, but certain issues should be addressed before making any revisions to the current school schedule..

When students enter high school, they begin to work at a specific job to earn some money in order to be prepared for their future career.

It is not a good idea for students to commit to a specific career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work, students are still getting education, and specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work. But they have to go to school and need time to do their schoolwork and study to pass.

It is important for students to do activites they enjoy to be healthy and have something positive and enjoyable to do. In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. For example, high school student is not well-educated and is still developing, so they need to keep studying and learning in school to graduate and get to a good collage to study about their future career that interests them and the dream job they are wishing to work for. Spending time on a specific job before their actual career can distract students and decrease their grades. When they get a specific job during their high school years, it will take them away from these enjoyable and positive activities they and will have no time to do it when they have a specific career and school, which can also cause stress for students and will never find anything positive that they enjoy to do. A specific career will take them away from their dream job.

Students should not commit to a career at a young age because specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. In their high school years, students begin to get an idea of what they wish to be for their future career, so they are still learning about it and that's how they get a better amount of money, be well-educated, and live a good and healthy life. For example, a student plays football and really enjoys it and it gives them positive energy",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
993989,"Although reducing summer break could provide students with more of an opportunity for class instruction, it is important to weigh the negatives that come with it. 
Studies have shown that in the United States, students from kindergarten to twelfth grade have received systematic instruction of less than 10 months a year with short summer vacations in between. 

Therefore, when considering these factors, it is important for school systems to take into account the student’s dreams and life aspirations. Not only can these longer school years disrupt the plans and goals of the students, but it can also affect family dynamics when parents are unable to take a substantial break from employment responsibilities. Changes and modifications need to be made in order to ensure the wellbeing of the students. Long summer breaks are often seen in other countries, with some countries dedicating up to 11 months of consecutive instruction. 

When considering the pros and cons of a 10-month school year, it is best to look at the harmful and helpful advantages to students. A longer break provides much-needed restoration and respite for students and lets them take control of their dreams. Yet a longer school year can also be detrimental to students' mental and physical health due to the lack of adequate rest and breaks throughout the year. This includes giving them enough space to pursue their personal interests while also maintaining their studies.",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

An other opportunity is if you go to college and you have a job at same time, if your classes are in the morning fron 8 AM to 4 PM, and you job schedule is at 1 PM to 11 pm .

At that time you have this big opportynity to sturdy and learning online, before work and you have some time left to do your homework, or other thing that you have to or you want to do in that day.

It's not noly online you take the class online but, you will have a viedo conferencing to motivate you, that if you not understand, that can explain it to you.

The school give them a big opportunity to progress, to have a good education and a better future.

For me it is a great option for them to attend it.. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family.

Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too.

I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress.

First of all I think it's would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you.

Today, technology has made it easier than ever to live an idle lifestyle. From Thomas Jefferson's famous maxim that encouraged citizens to ""never put off until tomorrow that which you can do today,"" an active and industrious spirit has been fundamental to our success. 
Throughout American history, the push for active thought and behavior has been a key factor in our nation's progress. Taking Thomas Jefferson’s words to heart, we must not be afraid to invest our time and energy into something today rather than waiting until tomorrow. But if history has taught us anything, it's that idle behavior comes with a price. From everyday people to entire nations, an idle lifestyle can often lead to stagnation, which often leads to missed opportunities and, in some cases, a complete reversal of fortune.

In order to avoid a similar fate and ensure a prosperous future, active behavior must remain at the forefront of our minds. Such a mindset will not only help us reach our individual goals more efficiently but will also benefit the country as a whole. However, the flip side of this mentality has been the risk of becoming too passive and idle in our society.  So let us take his words as a reminder to stay active and seize the day so that we can create a better future and leave behind a lasting legacy.",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students.

And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up.

Organizing a community service project to help improve the environment in my local area requires breaking the project into smaller, manageable steps. First, I must identify a specific goal for the project. For example, if my goal is to plant more trees, I must determine the type of tree and how many trees will be planted and the location for the planting.

Next, I need to determine any additional resources needed for the project such as plants, soil, tools, funds, volunteers, and so on. This could involve reaching out to local businesses or organizations for donations or support, recruiting volunteers, and leveraging social media.

893584,"I, for one, have experienced numerous failures while working towards a goal. 

This essay aims to address how failure can ultimately be a key element to achieving success. It was not until I looked at the mistakes I made that I could understand what I was doing wrong and make necessary changes in my studying approach. By exploring specific real-world examples of prominent successful individuals, exploring the relationship between failure and success, and looking at my own life experiences, I will demonstrate that experiencing failure can be an essential step towards success. His famous quote, “sometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,” serves as a reminder that failure is a necessary challenge to encounter when striving for greater success. 

First, by looking at the lives of prominent successful individuals, we can see the role of failure in their success. 

In conclusion, it is clear that failure can be a powerful stepping stone to success. Prominent successful individuals serve as examples of how mistakes can lead to great accomplishments. 
No matter how hard we work or how much ambition and motivation we have, failure is as much a part of success as accomplishments. In particular, while preparing for my college entrance exams, I was faced with many challenges and failed the first few tests. For example, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was famously fired from the company he helped build, only to return and lead it to even greater success. As such, it is crucial to embrace failure in any endeavor in order to reach true success.. And not just small setbacks – individuals like Thomas Edison, for example, demonstrated the huge leaps of progress that can made from grappling with mistakes, which ultimately became the foundation for some of his most impressive accomplishments. Furthermore, by reflecting on our own life experiences, we can understand the significance of failure in helping us grow and reach our goals. 

We can also look at the relationship between failure and success in our own lives. From Elon Musk to Oprah Winfrey, there are countless stories of individuals who have failed on their paths to becoming global success stories. This is evidenced by the countless prominent successful individuals who have experienced numerous struggles on their path to success",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

The last reason why having a play is enjoyable because after all the hard work with the team everyone can watch the play. It's important not to be shy on the night of the actually play. Sometimes after rehearsals the cast can go out to eat or have fun. The most important thing is that you had a fun time making, being in the play, and working with other students.

Being in a play is and enjoyable activity because you can meet new people, work as a team,and have fun. Also they can rehears lines together. I think this will be an enjoyable activity for school because you can meet new people, work with a team, and most of all have a great time.

During the play the cast members can make new friends and meet new people. It's important that the cast gets to know each other and become friends. You will be able to perform the play in front of students,teachers,friends,and families. You have to be brave and have confidence in yourself for the night of the play.

552783,"Healthy food tend to have less flavour and appeal than the junk food that students usually prefer. 

When students are forced to eat healthy food, there is no guarantee that the meals are as nutritious and beneficial to their health as parents or authorities tend to believe. 
Students should not be forced to consume healthy food in the school lunch system. 

Furthermore, healthy food is often more expensive than junk food. 

In conclusion, mandating a healthy lunch system in schools is not a good idea. The need to consume fresh fruits and vegetables, or balanced and nutritious meals cannot be overemphasized; however, it should not be mandated in the school lunch system, since it takes away the students’ right to choose their own food. Forced consumption of healthy options will have a negative impact on a student’s enjoyment of food and there is a risk of discouragement of a genuine interest to try and explore healthy foods. Children may not like the mandated food, which may result in them feeling deprived. The government should take this into account and not enact policies that are likely to cause financial problems for families that may not be able to afford the more expensive, more nutritious food. Students should be encouraged and informed on the benefits of healthy eating, but ultimately be left to make their own choices.",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In Ky point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that Mistake, and they tell you not to do when you grow.

First, one person that had shared their experiences with KE is one of Ky friend. He had told KE plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One of the experiences that he had told KE. Is that when he had the sake that I have, he used to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. Almost every week he used to live the house without permission. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stops going out of the house without permission. He tells KE his experiences, because he wants KE to learn that is you are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything.

Next, when people had told you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already told you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. t.c. had told you plethora of their experiences that they had.

You would share that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like the to commit the sake Mistake. Even that someone had already told you not to do it.

Finally, in Ky point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they don't want you to do the sake Mistake.

This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. What would happen if the school menu is change? Most of the kid will be upset because the menu have all the delicious food they like. We do not want to have any medical problems because of the food we eat.

Thank you for your attention.. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat.

One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. This does not mean this food is healthy.

United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol.

Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app.

All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol.

In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse.

A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body.

And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future.

In short, i support this idea because it make us mature, independent. It's also a good way to demonstrate your ability. After graduating from high school, they are a good person, aren't they?. Besides, we have more chance to success and to do new things. Day by day, everything is changing rapidly. From my point of view, this is a good idea because most students have a different situation in their life. Sometimes, they woud like to become an independent person, so nobody can coerce to do something even their parent. At that time, he was learning how to grow a special coffee, which is the only one not only in vietnam but also over the world. Actually, the life is a challenge: it isn't easy to you. A good behavior is more necessary than graduation, and they have to practise or use the lesson that were learned in high school, so they will get a lot of experience.

The life is an adventure, discovery, and study. Due to this problem, the student not only study in textbook, or document but also learn from substantial. If you graduate in high school early it will give you more time to learn new things from your life, so you will grow up and have a lot of opportunities to success in life. He was still graduate high school early and then i worked for his company. For instance, Generic_Name who i admired, was a founder the Coffee Shop Company in my country.

There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life.

My position on this issue. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.

go to school guys and stay in school.. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. It will be all your responsablity.

Students that go to school. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.

Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55.

Studying from home has numerous benefits that may make it better suited to certain individuals than attending school in person. It is important to consider both options seriously and factor in each student's individual abilities and preferences. For students who may be struggling academically, online courses allow for a more individualized learning experience and can provide extra help when needed.

However, there are also some clear advantages to attending school in person. In a regular school environment, students get the opportunity to learn social skills and work with classmates on group projects.

In conclusion , I agree that is more better to work with a group in class than alone . It is only concentration in a group or not , beacsuse oneself need to be more improve everyday and pass classes. It is more great have a goup with members that gonna help. We can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments. However sometimes can be difficult even the sudents don't try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself.

Sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate.

Students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. Also help to ourselves when one of the group don't usterstand about the topic.     . I think is more helpful to students do the assigments in class. Exist a controversy,

that is how more we ca have concentration during the assigments in class.

I think these thow ways of work , can get a good results. It is only put us effort to aprove classe.

When we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. Also students learn more of the members . It is a benefits to discover new people, hear more ideas,

Recent research shows that students who get involved in extracurricular activities like sports, music, or art can show an improved academic performance in school. 

Parents should be interested in their children's extra-curricular activities as they provide a chance for them to grow and make a positive difference in their lives.  All of these benefits can not only help students succeed now but also benefit them in the future.. Studies have also proven that students who participate in activities after school show better social and emotional wellbeing. The positive long-term effects of extracurricular activities include increased self-confidence, better time management skills, improved discipline, and a better understanding of how important working together as a team is.

For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me.

So online classes are not for everyone. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. . Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I don't do good at it ?

Overall, engaging in art is an immensely enjoyable educational activity with tremendous potential to positively impact our lives. There are many opportunities to explore in the art world, from becoming a professional artist or designer to different types of jobs in the industry, such as managing or marketing. It is well documented that engaging in creative activities such as art can reduce stress levels and promote an overall feeling of wellbeing. It provides numerous mental and physical benefits and can play an instrumental role in people finding their career paths and discovering their passions.. Art provides us with the opportunity to hone our creative skills and view the world in different ways. Moreover, people who go into a career related to art often cite their interest and experience from an early age, proving that art provides a valuable foundation to grow upon. This is particularly important from a mental health standpoint, as we can often find ourselves dealing with anxiety and even depression due to various life experiences.

The skills and knowledge one can gain from an art-based education can also be incredibly useful in pursuing a career. It is becoming more important for people to possess a strong skillset that includes creative thinking.

We may also become lost in a sea of sameness, where it seems as though everyone experiences the same scenarios, and the same trials and tribulations. 

Finally, there is an element of danger in trying to fit into a group if it involves participating in activities that deviate from our personal moral and ethical standards. 
Living in a world where people try to force others to conform can be incredibly detrimental to our well-being, both mentally and physically. We may try to emulate the behaviors and looks that those around us have adopted, and in doing so, we may be blind to our own carefully crafted uniqueness. In order to stay true to ourselves, we must evaluate the decisions we make in regards to conforming to the behavior of those around us and make sure that our individual values are not compromised in the process.. It is important to remember that by embracing our distinctive characteristics, we are able to form individual opinions and interpretations of the world, and this can lead to better understanding of ourselves, our peers and the world as a whole. We risk subscrib- ing to some potentially harmful ideas which can, in the long run, prove extremely detrimental for us.

In conclusion, living in a world where people try to force others to conform often leads to very negative outcomes. By being pressured into conforming, we risk sacrificing our individual sense of identity and originality for the sake of fitting in among everyone else.

Our character is not simply predetermined by factors beyond our control; instead, it is the result of a combination of both our own choices and influences from beyond our control.

For example, we may choose to pull away from negative influences or make a conscious effort to cultivate our own strengths and passions.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many students to transition to learning from home through online or video conferencing. This results in a lack of progress in classes and can set students back in terms of learning. Students may become distracted by technology, video games, friends and family, and other out-of-school activities. While teachers may still be available for assistance, digital communication lacks the same level of discussion as face-to-face instruction. 

Lastly, at-home learning can lead to a loss in general knowledge and awareness of the world around them. Without face-to-face instruction in the classroom, students may not have the skills they need to succeed.. 

In conclusion, home learning has potential advantages such as convenience and accessibility, however these benefits may come at the cost of personal support, focus, and awareness. Although this is a revolutionary move towards modern education, students may not benefit from learning remotely. 

First, without access to a physical classroom, students lack the personalized support they need. 

Second, learning from home can be difficult for some students. Since there is no one monitoring their progress, many may struggle to focus. Schools can provide valuable life experiences and necessary social interaction that help prepare students for life beyond the classroom. Additionally, there is no real opportunity for students to voice their opinions and engage in interactive learning, which is essential for growth. In fact, students learning from home can face many potential challenges.

Asking one person means that individual is likely more familiar with the situation and may be better able to provide specific, detailed advice. 

Overall, I believe that asking one person for advice is the most beneficial. 
When considering whether to ask one person or multiple people for advice, there are several pros and cons to consider. As the saying goes, “Two heads are better than one.” Personal anecdotes can also be useful; For example, one person might have asked advice from three friends and found that taking a combination of all their advice was more effective than following any one of them exclusively.

The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p.

Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep.

In conclusion adopting the curfew idea would be good because it will keep the teenagers out of trouble and help them mange their time appropritely.. while it would have been better with the curfew in place.

Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

44395,"Dear Senator,

I am writing to you today to express my support for abolishing the Electoral College. The Electoral College is an outdated and undemocratic system that gives disproportionate power to a small number of states. It is time for us to move to a system of electing the president by popular vote.

There are many reasons why the Electoral College is unfair. First, it gives more power to voters in small states than in large states. For example, a voter in Wyoming has three times the voting power as a voter in California. This is because Wyoming has one electoral vote for every 194,755 residents, while California has one electoral vote for every 707,299 residents.

Second, the Electoral College can result in a situation where the candidate who wins the popular vote does not become president. This has happened five times in American history, most recently in 2016 when Donald Trump won the presidency despite losing the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3 million votes.

Third, the Electoral College encourages candidates to focus their campaigns on a small number of ""battleground"" states where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This means that candidates often ignore the needs of voters in other states, which can lead to a feeling of disenfranchisement.

A system of electing the president by popular vote would be much more fair and democratic. It would give all voters an equal voice in the election, and it would ensure that the candidate who wins the most votes becomes president.

I urge you to support a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College. Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Electoral College is kind of unfair for some people because they think that whoever got the most popular vote should be President. But to think, what if the people we vote to is not right to be the next President and she/he got that most popular vote? Wouldn't that be f disaster? I say we should keep the Electoral College.

Electoral College process in consists of the electors that have been selected by the people. The ones who got selected are the ones with great intelligence and with great sense of leadership. In the first passage it mentioned that ""The Electoral College HFS f total of 538 electors and the majority of electoral votes are required to have 270 electoral votes."" This means that for you to be one of the candidates you left have to have 270 electoral votes and this is f good way of picking our candidates to run for us for President.

Remember the election between Off and Romney? It was close but, not that close. Our President, Off got 61.7 percent of the electoral vote compared to 51.3 percent of the popular votes for him and Romney. Almost of every States electoral votes is on f ""winnertfkefll"" basis. For every slight of plurality in each of the States, it creates f ""landslide electorflvote"". This means that f tie would be possible because the number 538 votes is uneven but, it's mostly not to happen and this is because of Electoral College.

Electoral College avoids the problem of which didn't receive f majority of the votes. In passage three it gave FN example about how Nixon in 1968 and Clinton in 1992 both had 43 percent only in purity of the popular votes and the winning number of the Electoral College is 301 and 370 electoral votes. Because of Electoral College the pressure that happens in electing the next President to left us for four years is reduced and it also tells us which is the winner of the election.

If we elect our President using popular votes it high be f disaster. Because not FLL of the candidates are that great of leading the whole country and If he/she got selected to be our next leader for the next four years our country would be in f huge chaos. I slightly free with electing that person and making him/her the next President because they got the most popular votes but, then again I don't think it's the right way of picking our new leader.

A lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. Let's follow our character that we choose to be, no matter what!!. Life is easier and happier when we follow our own rules. When it comes to choosing, it might be as hard as a stone at the begining because, we are not sure if it is going to work or not. Or they can learn from what thier teacher teaches them, and we all know that our teachers are always willing to teach us the best behaviour and that is why the most students start to choose thiere character at school.

.

When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character. And when we have the confidence, it is way easier to manage any case that comes to our life. For exampe: Sometimes in life we get so many bad things on our way, but if we choose to take it easy on them by choosing our best character, that helps a lot because it is making our life easier in an easy way without much stressing.

Cna you imagine how good it feels to live by choosing your best character? Choosing our own character for ourself will never make us regrate it in the future.

But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings.

So if you failed on something be enthusiasm on it it will help you more to be success in life.. they will keep trying because they love it or they are still exited on that work that they have failed.

I know some people don't like doing one thing again and again but if you want to be success in life you have to keep doing it until you haven't achieve it because you can't be success in life without being a failure. I agree that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you will be exited for your next step and you want to know whats gonna happened once you have passed.

For example if you fail on doing something, you will be exited on doing it again until you haven't pass because you might be thinking thats your dream to achieve it or its really important to achieve what i fail in it. when people failed on something they might say that its hard and i am not gonna do it again because they didn't try their best on it, but if you keep trying you will get some hint on it and it will be easier to achieve what you working on",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

In recent years, many high schools and education programs have been created with the aim of helping students find a career-oriented path and set them up for a successful future. On the other hand, making a commitment to a particular career at a young age can limit a person’s options and be restrictive in terms of open exploration and research.

The greatest advantage of career-oriented programs and high schools is that it gives students the opportunity to better prepare for life after graduation. Additionally, these schools and programs can also provide valuable connections and networking opportunities, which can be invaluable to young people seeking employment.. Making a commitment to a career at a young age can have some advantages and disadvantages.

On one hand, having a plan in place for what you want to do for a living can provide focus and drive for young students as they complete their high school studies. Having the structure and guidance to decide on a future career can give young people the tools they need to ensure a successful outcome",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           . Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. In conclusion i think it's a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student's to take online classes so they can get the help they need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

For those with limited time or energy to be inactive, hiring a butler or other household assistant might be the way to go. 
Inactivity can be beneficial in more ways than one. It turns out the break was just what I needed to refresh and recharge my mind, and I was able to complete the project with relative ease. Rest is essential for our bodies to recover from daily activities, and can help us stay ahead of our physical and mental health. Taking some time for self-care can reward us with more mental clarity and improved productivity. I took a few hours to watch some TV and relax before tackling a big project I had been avoiding. 

In small doses, inactivity can be beneficial for productivity purposes. Taking a break from school or work and catching up on our favorite TV shows can be an excellent way to stimulate our minds and relax our bodies. Hiring household assistants like a butler or maid can help to further free up time and energy, making more time to be inactive. 

I experienced the benefits of inactivity firsthand after a particularly long work day. These extra hands can also help get through daily errands, cleaning, and organizing, so that less valuable time is devoted to mundane activities.. For example, taking breaks throughout the day to relax and recharge can help us to focus better on tasks that require more energy",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
47625,"One of the most significant technological advancements in recent years is the development of driverless cars. While some people see this as a revolutionary innovation that will make our roads safer and more efficient, I believe that the development of driverless cars is a step too far.

The author of ""Driverless Cars are Coming"" raises several concerns about the safety and practicality of these vehicles. One of the most pressing concerns is the issue of safety. While proponents of driverless cars argue that they will be safer than human-driven vehicles, the fact remains that there is no guarantee that these cars will be completely safe. The author notes that the reliance on sensors and algorithms raises questions about the ability of machines to replace the nuanced decisions of human drivers. Additionally, the potential for distraction or drowsiness due to the driver's decreased role in controlling the vehicle is a significant concern.

Another concern raised by the author is the issue of dependency on technology. As we become increasingly reliant on technology to perform tasks that were once done by humans, we risk losing basic skills and awareness of our surroundings. The author argues that this could lead to a disconnection from the act of driving and a lack of situational awareness. This is a valid concern, as we have already seen the negative effects of excessive screen time and a lack of physical activity on our health and well-being.

Furthermore, the author raises economic and accessibility concerns. The cost of developing and owning driverless cars could create a divide between those who can afford them and those who cannot. This could lead to wider socio-economic disparities and question the practicality of mass-producing vehicles that are not universally accessible.

In conclusion, while the development of driverless cars may seem like an exciting technological innovation, it is essential to consider the potential risks and consequences. The safety concerns, dependency on technology, and economic and accessibility issues raised by the author are valid reasons to proceed with caution. As a 10th-grade student, I believe that we should focus on developing technologies that enhance human capabilities rather than replacing them. By doing so, we can ensure that we are using technology in a way that benefits society as a whole, rather than creating new problems that we may not be able to solve.",,1.0

391036,"Many schools across the country require students to complete summer assignments to assure that they continue their pursuit of knowledge even without a teacher present. Gut should these assignments be designed by the teacher, or should they be designed by the student? If a student were given freedom with their project, it would be a lot more enjoyable rather than if a teacher put strict conditions on it. Gut a lack of strictness would mean that students are less likely to complete their project, and they wouldn't know when the work they have done is enough. Teachers should put that restriction on the student and give them a specific assignment to ensure that the appropriate amount of work gets done.

Students are less likely to complete a project that they have freedom on and if they do complete it, the quality would suffer greatly compared to if a teacher gave them a prompt or a specific task to accomplish. The point of a summer assignment is to prevent to student from losing knowledge or getting rusty because of a break. Although the point of the summer break is to let students relax until the next year starts, it's still important that they keep their studies up. Assignments shouldn't be student designed because that would allow too much leisure and when school comes around, most students would not have it done. For example, I had two summer assignments last summer. One was for English and one was for Math. For the English one, the assignment was to read any book of my choosing and write a review about it. This assignment had very unclear instructions and I, the student, was supposed to add my own twist to it and complete the assignment however I wanted to. I started on the assignment, but never finished it because I didn't have the motive since there was no specific prompt to answer to, so I wrote a couple of sentences and called it quits. Gut for the Math assignment, I had a packet to complete of practice problems. The finish was in sight and crystal clear. I did it throughout the summer and finished it by August. The reassurance I felt that once I did a specific amount of work and followed the teacher's directions, I would be done is what encouraged me to finish. The English assignment was unclear, and I didn't know how much to complete to make sure that I was on track for next year.

Summer assignments are important for a student and the reason to have them teacher designed is to give the student reassurance and to make sure the student doesn't do too much work over what's supposed to be a break, yet it keeps them on track. If an assignment is student designed then the student will do one of three things: overwork themselves, not fully apply their capabilities, or not do the work at all. For these reasons, summer assignments should all be teacher designed.",,0.0

It has the ability to ignite creativity and inspire us to do extraordinary things. In comparison, imagination allows us to conceive entirely new ideas and generate pioneering solutions. It can take us to places knowledge may not be able to go, allowing us to think outside the box and explore uncharted territory. Both are equally essential in propelling us to accomplish the extraordinary.. For example, some of the greatest technological breakthroughs of our time, from the light bulb to the smartphone, began as mere figments of someone’s imagination. 

Ultimately, a balance between imagination and knowledge is essential. It gives us the courage to take risks and propel us to strive for excellence. Having knowledge gives us the confidence to pursue our wildest dreams, while imagination gives us the power to turn these dreams into reality.

Then a deranged rogue is going to get the hold of it and try to take over the world. Sounds like a movie doesn't it, but stuff like the FACS were in movies way back when and now hake we them in real life. I can't be the only one that sees this happening.

But the good side I here for this technology is that it can help people. Or help people to help other people. Like such, what if our friend is acting weird. Which they commonly do. Just out of the ordinary behavior like being more quiet or not wanting to spend as much time with you as usual. So you trick I mean tell them stand in front of your weird computer, your FACS. They do it, it scans the 44 major muscles in their face. It tells you that she's 20% mad, 10% happy, and 70% sad. So now you help her with the predicaments and you guys like happily ever after.

Some other ways the FACS may be good intention is that it can be used as a lie detector. As said in paragraph 8 you use different muscles for a genuine smile than for a false or fake one. It can be used by the FBI in interviewing or interrogation. Or you could see when a politician is faking it also conveyed in pa graph 8.

A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue.

Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. In school teachers should wait for students out side the door with a box so they can't use their phones during class.

Another important benefit of mistakes is that they help people to become more resilient. 

Mistakes often push people out of their comfort zones and encourage them to try something new. Everyone at some point has made an error that had a lasting effect. Although it can be stressful and uncomfortable to make a mistake, it can help a person grow in many ways. This can open up new doors of insight and learning that they would have otherwise missed out on. 
Mistakes can have a great impact on a person's life, leading them to become better human beings in the long run. 

In conclusion, mistakes can be difficult to experience, but they can bring out the best in people and help them become better human beings. With a willingness to learn and grow, mistakes can be used not only to gain insight, but also to build resilience and personal growth.. It can also help them become more aware of themselves and their place in the world, leading to increased levels of emotional intelligence. With this increased self-knowledge, people are more equipped to handle difficult situations in the future. The experience made me realize how my words and actions can affect others, so I made sure that in the future I was more considerate and aware of the needs of others.

Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. . Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you haven't even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you.

The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. Most zoo's can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? They're thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun.

The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park.

A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they don't like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around what's around the world. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live.

The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. There's different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you haven't tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have.

Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people I've met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. So let's say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing.

He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someone's life and help them. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one.""

Listening to other people's advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. This is my thoughts on why some people would like multiple and how it can affect them in a certain way.. You could also use the people's advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friend's dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dad's advice which would impact him negatively.

But it's not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Conclusion that you should ask more than one person so you can get more multiple opinions and you might get the right answer of your problem or question by the right person. But some people don't like telling other people there question or problem one cause there scared or shy or they might think that the person will not know or understand what the person is talking about that sometimes can happened it happen to my friend once where he had a math question asked the teacher but the teacher didn't know what he meant or what he was talking about so the teacher tryed to tell him his question but that wasnt the question my friend ask for so he told a student that sits next to him and he understanded what he was talking about so he then helped him with the question he had..

Like, no more waking up early for school, no more crowded bus Sides, and no more awkward lunchtime conversations with people you don't Really want to talk to. 

But here's the thing: there's this thing called a ""lack of motivation"" that's like, super common among my generation. Like, a lot of us just yen't super into learning, you know? And h think distance learning could totally help with that!  See, when you'Ye in a physical classroom, it's easy to get distracted by you friends of you phone of whatever. But when you'Ye at home, you can focus way better because you'Ye in a place that's comfortable for you. Plus, you can learn at you own pace, which is like, super important for people who need a little extra time to understand stuff.

But, h know some people might be like, ""But what about socialization?!"" And yeah, h get it. Being around other people can be fun and all, but let's be Year, sometimes it's just not worth it. Like, have you even tried to have a conversation with someone who's sitting Light next to you and all they want to talk about is that favorite Fortnite steamed?  Ht's like, no, thank you. With distance learning, you can still connect with other students and learn from them, but you don't have to deal with all that awkward small talk. 

Now, h know some parents might be worried about the lack of structure that comes with distance learning. Like, they might think that kids will just sit around all day playing video games and not actually learn anything. But that's not true!  There aye so many cool tools and Resources out there that can help students stay on track and learn stuff, even when they'Ye not in",,1.0

And, of course, schools can provide opportunities for academic growth, as well as the potential for exploring different intellectual pursuits, developing social skills, understanding cultural norms, and engaging in activities that can shape a person’s character traits. Most notably, the early influences of parents, siblings, friends, and school can greatly impact the development of a person’s character traits. 
Human character traits are shaped by a wide range of influences. Siblings can also be powerful models of behavior that have a significant impact on the development of character traits, particularly in the areas of cooperation, communication, and leadership. Friends can offer insights to beliefs, values, and lifestyles that can influence a person’s character traits. Parents, for example, can have a major influence on a child’s moral compass by providing consistent guidance and setting a positive example of how to act and treat others",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Finding out who I am and what my purpose in life is is not an easy task. I will prioritize my own needs, carve out time for things I'm passionate about, and allow myself to explore potential interests. Many people rely on family and friends for guidance but it can be difficult to really listen to your own inner voice. To stay true to myself, I will strive to take time to reflect and be mindful of my own thoughts and feelings. By being actively conscious and true to myself, I can discover who I am and what I am meant to do.. Society often puts pressure on us to follow a certain path and being true to ourselves can be challenging amidst it all.

From that day forward, I decided to always keep a positive attitude in life no matter what I am doing. I made myself smile even when things were hardest and kept positive affirmations in my mind throughout. I realized the value in maintaining a positive attitude no matter how difficult the situation. I was completely overwhelmed by a seemingly insurmountable challenge that had been set before me: to build a complex website in a very short amount of time. I felt defeated before even beginning and was convinced the project was doomed. 

But then something shifted and I decided to take a different approach. As a result, I was able to complete the project not only on time, but in half the amount of time I originally anticipated.

This was a life-changing moment for me. 

Through experience, I now know that having a positive attitude can often times make the difference between success and failure. Not only does it help me stay motivated and feel better, but I have seen first-hand how it can contribute to my success. 
I recently had a personal experience that once again reminded me of the power of a positive attitude to lead us to success. I remembered a quote that said, “A positive attitude can create mountains out of molehills.” So I decided to challenge myself to have a positive attitude during the entire process",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
227687,"Driving is the primary way of transportation, to get from point A to point B. It's a great way to reduce traveling time, and traffic is almost nonexistent. Some people would say it's better than walking, or riding a bicycle. But what if we limited these polluting vehicles and replaced our transportation for our daily routine? Well, we can. Limiting car usage can help us from lots of city and/or regional pollution. It can improve safety and conserve the resources we already have. Saving even more time is also something all people want to try to accomplish. Limiting the use of cars can help make this world a much better, and more breathable, reusable, and not a time consuming place.

To begin with, the answer to why we should limit the use of cars is stated in the form of pure science: pollution. All around the world, from North America to Asia, every continent has a majorly polluted city. Beijing, London, Mexico City, Miami, New York City, you name it! Major cities nowadays are becoming more polluted than ever before, due to gasoline and diesel fuel used in cars today. Overpopulated cities can have too many cars, and too many cars driven can increase the amount of polluted air around us. In document two, the capital of France, Paris, is home to almost ten million people. After days of an almost broken record amount of pollution intoxicating the city, Paris enforced a driving ban for two days. Cars and motorcycles were forced to be left at home, or a steep fine will be charged. Even though almost 4,000 drivers were fined, congestion in Paris decreased by nearly 60%, after intense smog. Diesel fuel was the culprit to this pollution, due to France's tax policy that favors diesel fuel rather than gasoline. Diesel fuel cars make up about 67% of cars in France, comparing to an average 57% of diesel engines in Western Europe, according to Router's. The smog cleared enough on Monday for the French politicians to rescind the ban. In document three, Columbia's capital city, Bogotá, had a goal to promote alternatives to personal transportation and reduce the amount of smog throughout the city. Day Without Cars was born, one day every month when cars are not allowed to be driven, or a fine will be charged. The turnout of people was immense, even though rain showers and thunderstorms poured onto the event. Mayor Antennas Mocks stated that the Day Without Cars ""was a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution."" Parks and sports centers rose from the city streets, and sidewalks have been paved for bicycles and ongoing pedestrians. Limiting car usage is not be a bad thing, considering we need the air we already breathe.

Furthermore, limiting car usage is not a bad solution to the global pollution, and is not a bad solution to improve safety and conserve resources, either. Teenagers all over the world are more prone to accidents than any other age group. Getting your license is great, and driving alone is equally awesome, but having no regard for safety while driving? Not as awesome as it sounds. For an additional document, it's life itself. Driving on a daily basis takes up gasoline, and lots of it. On average, a normal driver takes up about twenty gallons of gasoline a week, if not, more. Diesel fuel used in pickup trucks and semitrucks is more expensive, but lasts longer than regular gasoline. Resources have dwindled since the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico of 2011, and regular Americans are running out of the food for their car. On the safety spectrum, looking out for a street to turn at, for pedestrians, and for people that may cut you off sounds like a blast, but safety and crashes/accidents end up to be a result in many driving situations. Many people consider for driving to be unsafe, due to the statistics of daily crashes on highways, and even intersections, which happen to be the most dangerous place you can have an accident. Those types of people have put a hold on driving, and have caused a decline in the nation's miles driven per person scale, stated in document four. As of April 2013, the number driven per person went down almost nine percent. Factors to that decline may have been the 2008 stock recession, or the fact that cars got smaller and more expensive. As a result, more people started to walk to work, or buy a bicycle, like they use mainly in Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Safety is becoming a subject that is mainly disregarded by citizens, and resources are becoming less and less, yet the alternatives for driving, such as walking or taking the city bus, are becoming more and more popular.

Moreover, car usage should become more limited because they are other ways, faster and more efficient ways, to get to your destination. Major cities all over the globe have a multitude of ways to transport people from one side of the city to the other. Taking buses, walking, taking the subway, helicopter, taxis, anything! Except a car. Car use in major cities is almost unheard of, as traffic is everywhere in a big city, and overpopulation can cause the traffic, or at least, be the contributing factor of it. People want to get to another place in sixty seconds or less, and driving in that matter never happens. For example, car use in New York City is busy. Of course, being ""the city that never sleeps"", cars are not the best way to get around. Walking or taking the subway underground helps get the people around easier and faster. As expected, a large drop in the percentage of teenagers getting there license has occurred, according to document four. New York has a new bike sharing program, and it's skyrocketing bridge/tunnel tolls reflect those new priorities taking place. Driving by young people decreased significantly between 2001 and 2009. Woven into a connected web to save time, new alternatives to the polluting machines we call cars are slowly backing up into reverse, and disappearing from the category of main transportation.

In conclusion, limiting car usage is the best option to achieve all the contributing factors. Pollution hurts cities and their environments, even their people. The air we breathe is more important than the amount of time it takes reach our destination. Safety improvements need to happen to make drivers have common sense and to not run over someone crossing the street. Resources are limited everywhere, and what we'll do after they've been gone? That answer has not been found yet. Saving time is our number one priority, and we try to beat our records every time we go somewhere, whether it be using the same mode of transportation, or trying out a new one. Next time, be spontaneous for a day, and don't use a car. Try a new way to get to work; taking the subway and watching a new scene come at you every two seconds; or walk to work and admire the time slowing by around you. Breathe the fresh air like never before. Remember: it's not the destination that you should look forward to; it's the journey.",,0.0
421792,"For example, I recall a time when I had to work extra hard to manage a difficult assignment in a short time-frame. As Emerson said, by going confidently in the direction of our dreams, we are giving ourselves a chance to realize our full potential and to achieve amazing feats.. In the end, I achieved a grade that I was proud of and as a result, I felt a great sense of accomplishment and growth.

Overall, pushing ourselves beyond what we have already mastered provides an invaluable opportunity to learn, experience, and create something that we may have thought was an impossibility. During my university years, I was often in situations where I had to push myself beyond what I knew I could do in order to get a desired result. By pushing ourselves to push beyond our current level of mastery, there is more potential to grow and achieve our wildest dreams.

I have had many experiences in my life affirming this notion, particularly with regards to educational achievements. With a focused mindset and a strong work ethic, I surpassed my own expectations. These inspiring words provide a valuable insight into the importance of pushing ourselves to strive for more in life.

I have always agreed with Winston Churchill's statement that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm"" and I stand by that sentiment. Failure is a natural and inevitable part of life, and no journey of success can be made without encountering failure along the way. This positive attitude allows me to take risks and try new approaches which can ultimately lead to great success. 

Rather than let failure be a source of discouragement, we must use it as a stepping stone towards greater success. 

In conclusion, Winston Churchill was right when he said that success consists of going from failure to failure without losing enthusiasm. By viewing failure not as an obstacle, but as an opportunity to learn and grow, we can find the courage and perseverance necessary to stay on the course of success..

Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at.

Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.

Always try to do more then what you have already done. Some may say if you don't go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. It's good to do anything it takes to master something in life. The more you grow the more better you'll get.

When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. You will not grow if you don't go beyond from where you are at. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.

Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.

When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing.                                                      . It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes.

24977,"When it comes to the topic of meaningful relationships, few things are as important and rewarding as a strong bond between two people. A genuine, healthy connection enables both parties to cultivate a sense of security, intimacy and trust. Not only does this provide individuals with a feeling of closeness and comfort, but it can also help them navigate through life's hardships together. But in order for these relationships to be truly meaningful, they must involve more than just surface interactions or shallow conversations — there needs to be an emotional investment on both sides that fuels the camaraderie even further. While physical attraction may bring two people into each other’s lives initially, it is their ability to explore each other’s minds and hearts with compassion that allows those bonds develop into something substantial. Possessing strong communication skills is essential if you want to nurture any kind of relationship worth having; understanding what another person needs from you starts with being able to effectively listen and express yourself authentically without making assumptions or jumping conclusions about how someone else perceives your words. This means taking the time out every now and again for sincere heart-to-heart talks so that every member involved feels comfortable enough within themselves — as well as one another —to open up honestly about whatever thoughts or feelings they might be keeping inside without fear of judgment . . Equally important is respecting boundaries when interacting with friends or partners; using kindness instead of pressure when expressing appreciation towards loved ones ,and giving back love whenever necessary helps create an environment where members feel secure knowing their desires will be respected no matter what form they take . It’s these subtle acts that make all the difference in building lasting connections – because at its base level such dynamic relies heavily on mutual respect rather than mere admiration alone . . . We should always strive for relationships built on stability , love , honesty , empathy & acceptance — anything less won't do us much good long-term-wise! When we commit ourselves

312860,"Some businesses only work 4 days in the week maybe to conserve energy or maybe to the employers can rest one more day. I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework and they could work too. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for this students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where i am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids.

In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because i have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came only four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom.

I agree with the businesses who only open

4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when i was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we don't had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you don't pay the energy."" and sometimes i get mad because i wanted to listed music and watched TV.

Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parent, student, and labor and the week is to short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because it's not easy to anyone to be responsible. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. The Government will can make that my dream came be true to have only 4 days of school.. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers and I was think how can she do all those things and then I realized that she wake up everyday because she want the best for us and doesn't matter how tired she felt. We can't ""never give up"" because fighting.

In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

By combining persistence and resilience, we can arm ourselves with the positive attitude and motivation needed to tackle any obstacle. 
The path to achieving any goal is often difficult, littered with unexpected roadblocks and challenges. 

Persistence is an invaluable characteristic for anyone striving to reach their goals. So wherever you're headed on your journey, don’t forget to take along the essential companions of persistence and resilience.. This, in turn, can give us the confidence to make the necessary changes and take the necessary action to ultimately achieve our goals. No matter the size of the roadblock or challenge, persistence allows us to press on and develop a ""can do"" attitude, rather than succumbing to a ""can't do"" attitude. By allowing ourselves to stay focused and committed even when faced with adversity, we make the journey to our goals easier and faster. This in turn gives us the necessary willpower and determination to push on and ultimately make progress toward our goals.

Resilience is also an important part of achieving our objectives. But with perseverance and resilience, even the most ambitious and seemingly insurmountable goals can be achieved. When the going gets tough and the challenge seems insurmountable, resilience helps us to stay strong and keep believing in ourselves. Without it, it’s all too easy to give up when faced with the obstacles that come along the way. It allows us to pick ourselves up after a failure or misstep and remind ourselves that we can — and will — achieve our goals.

In my opinion, there should be a balance between allowing the use of cell phones and banning them. When used properly, cell phones have the potential to be very beneficial in a classroom setting; however, it is also important to consider the potential for distraction, in order to ensure that students remain focused on their school work.. Classroom rules should be established regarding cell phone use -- for instance, permitting students to use them for taking notes during lectures, or for researching information online, while also forbidding their use during other activities, such as discussions or group work. 
Cell phones have become an integral part of today's society, and the different perspectives on whether they should be allowed in the classroom can spark debate.

433133,"One time in particular, I was having problems with a coworker I didn't get along with. This gave me the chance to apologize and make amends with those that I had wronged, as well as taught me the importance of honesty in my life. Through different situations involving honesty, it is important to be discernible when and how we communicate our thoughts and opinions. For example, when I was younger I made some poor decisions that I wasn't proud of, but I always owned up to them rather than trying to hide my actions. 

Finally, when it comes to arguments, I believe that being honest is the most important factor. Honest people are seen as dependable to their friends and family, and allow them to have trust in their words and actions. At the time, I was feeling frustrated and wanted to win the argument, but then I realized that if I was honest and civil, it would not only benefit me in the long run, but would also help the other person understand my point of view and come to an understanding. 

When I don't like someone, I'm not always inclined to tell them directly how I feel. Despite our disagreements, I treated him with respect, always seeking to find a common ground for our working relationship. Even in disagreements, it's important to share your opinion honestly but to also remain respectful, stay open to what the other person has to say, and work towards a resolution. 

In all, I believe that honesty is an essential part of living a good life and making meaningful connections with others. I experienced this firsthand in an argument with a family member. This fostered a more positive work environment despite our differences and helped others to trust in my honesty. Instead, I try to be civil and polite, and provide an honest but diplomatic answer when asked for my opinions. Honesty is also a key part of this, because it fosters an environment where mistakes are acknowledged and gives others the incentive to do the same. By being honest in different situations, we set a positive example for others and create an environment of mutual respect and understanding.. 
Living a life of honesty is key in being respected, trusted, and having healthy relationships with those around us.

Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.. They will know what kind of project to create. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.

Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time.

At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project.

Sports, science, and musical activities are all enjoyable educational activities available in our school. It is this immediate sense of enjoyment combined with a feeling of accomplishment that makes it the most enjoyable educational activity for me.. I personally find musical activities to be the most enjoyable form of educational activity within our school because of the direct links to art, creativity, and collaboration.

I remember my first foray into musical activities in school when I signed up for choir. Both sports and science activities involve learning and can also be fun for students, but musical activities often provide an immediate sense of enjoyment and can be more thrilling.

409407,"In other cases that i haven't really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. In this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. I also love doing makeup, since i was little i would always play with makeup and growing up i would buy a lot of makeup but didnt really know how to use the products. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they don't know. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. Now a big makeup store at the mall offered me a job their because they loved the way i do my makeup. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future.

I would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school.       . So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that. Growing up i started seeing my interest and also had options on what i would like to do in the future. until i started by little learning how to use the products. Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Some students don't know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life.

Now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

779771,"There is no doubt that problems are difficult and daunting, but Ellington’s quote encourages us to remember that a successful resolution to a problem requires hard work, perseverance, and dedication, and therefore presents an opportunity to hone our skills and potentially reap satisfying rewards. 

Therefore, Ellington’s quote is a profound reminder of the importance of approaching challenges as unique opportunities, and the fundamental truth that if we are willing to try our best in difficult situations, great things can be achieved.. Moreover, being able to rise to the occasion and find innovative solutions to challenging issues can result in a sense of pride and accomplishment that stays with us long after the task is completed. 
The renowned jazz musician Duke Ellington once asserted: “A problem is a chance for you to do your best.” This inspiring statement encourages us to look at challenges as opportunities rather than burdens. From a sociopsychological perspective, this notion is particularly persuasive because it encourages a productive growth mindset rather than a fixed, prisoner-to-the-problem mentality. 

I thoroughly agree with Ellington’s statement",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Another is achievement this come from the goals you made and the effort you did it for your accomplishments.

Also students their has the last word, if they need to practice the things the some people thing, to the benefit for their self-esteem, but the two are good idea for instill students don't believe, if this is the correct option, also they need to make the best effort to practice the best way to help their career in the future.

In conclusion the students dont need to practice thing that some people thinks,to improve to help and learn more about self-esteem, this is one the purpose to improve their self-esteem, this is optional in what you believe if their praising or achievements but this two different things, but is good idea learn both for better self-esteem to understand. And other is they need to improve in their achievement, because they are not sure if this come from praise or achievement. Some people believe in praising a student's work to build self-esteem even if the work is not the students best effort.

I believe that is not the best choose a student's to practice this work to build self- esteem; for many reason, because some people don't has the idea if the student's are agree or disagree this is no the best way to improve in their self-esteem to practice on praising.

510752,"Many teenagers already view school as a chore that needs to be completed without clear direction. Adding more time to an already long school day could make them resent it even more, thus creating a negative attitude towards it.

In conclusion, while many may believe that increasing the amount of time students spend in school can benefit their education, the facts suggest otherwise. However, there is an equal amount of evidence to suggest that it is ineffective and detrimental to the quality of students’ lives. 
Extending the school day is something that many students and parents alike believe would benefit education. It can lead to exhaustion, decreased motivation, and an overall hatred of the educational system. If the school day was lengthened, students would find themselves even more sleep deprived, likely leading to a decrease in academic performance due to lack of focus and energy. Increasing the amount of time students spend in class could cause them to become exhausted and resentful of their education.

For starters, many students already struggle to stay awake during the current school day, not to mention trying to pay attention and learn. As such, it is in the best interest of students to keep the school day as is.. In addition, a longer school day also limits the time for physical activity and extracurricular activities, which can have profound and positive effects on students’ academic and social development.

Students can join these extracurricular activities, allowing them to learn about these topics and be around other people who have similar interests. Extracurricular activities can be great, but unfortunately most people do not know that. There are many benefits to requiring students to participate in extracurricular activities such as improving students mental health, improving their physical health, and improving the school. Schools should require all students to participate in an extracurricular activity.

Requiring extracurricular activities is a great way to increase a student's mental health. When required to choose an activity, students choose the activity that seems to be the best to them. This causes students to find an interest that if they had not joined an extracurricular activity, would have never discovered that they enjoy. Having interests and hobbies such as these activities is a great way to increase mental health. They help people find happiness in life. It gives people something they enjoy and can spend their time doing. Since students are interested in the activity or activities that they participate in, they can be more social. Once a student joins an extracurricular activity they can talk to people with similar interests and make friends. Band social has an amazing impact on a person's mental health and these activities make that happen. There are many benefits to a student's mental health caused by these activities, but these activities can also improve a student's physical health.

These activities can have a great impression on a student's physical health. Often times students do not get the exercise that they need to be healthy. Students often to home and sit down to do homework, watch TV, and do other activities that have little to no benefit for their health. Extracurricular activities such as sports can help students get the exercise that they need. By participating in these types of activities students can to outside, exercise, and do other activities that improve their physical health. Although these activities have great benefits students still decide to not sign up for them. This is why requiring students to join an activity is a great idea. Students can discover that they like the activity whilst also band healthy. There are many health benefits to requiring extracurricular activities, but there are other benefits.

Another benefit to requiring extracurricular activities is improving the school. It would allow students to increase their academic abilities. Students have the option to choose academic activities that are related to subjects such as science. In these activities students would be able to learn and become interested in the topic. As a result of learning students improve in class. This would raise the student's grades and the school's average. Not only will the student's academic abilities be improved but also the activities that they are participating in. More students participating in the activities would mean that there would be more ideas in activities such as student council or more skilled people on sports teams. Lastly, it would improve the school because of the interested and active students. When people get interested in a topic, hobby, or activity they generally care about it. For example, students who play sports want to improve not only their abilities but also the activity itself. This could be done in many ways including doing something such as getting new sports equipment.

In conclusion students should be required to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. These activities are great for the student's mental health by creating a hobby for students that they enjoy. They also have a great effect on the student's physical health by helping them get the exercise they need. Lastly, they benefit the school and activities themselves by improving education and student participation. All schools across the world should require students to participate in an extracurricular activity.",,0.0

Talks about Now they Have a new system, and it can detect Now a person is feeling. This new technology can be very Helpful for students. I believe it can be Helpful to students because their are some people who feel depressed, and it is complicated to tell if they are Zappy, depressed, or angry.

This can Help students and adults to see Now they are actually feeling because some people don't even know Now they feel. Some students might say ""that computer doesn't know Now I feel"" but the computer FACS(Facial Action Coding System) comes from a good force. The people who created ""FACS"" were Thomas Huang and Prof. Thomas Huang was from the Beckman institute for advance at the university of Illinois working wot Prof. Therefore, they the system ""FACS"" is a trust worthy computer to identify your emotions.

This system can Help students with their lives. To demonstrate, in paragraph 3 it states ""Beckman classified six basic emotions Happiness, suprised, anger, disgusted, fear, and sadness."" when a student is feeling depressed (no students should feel like that) a teacher doesn't know Now the student is feeling out of the six basic emotions that Beckman described. Thus, the system will Help teachers know Now the student is feeling ;and if the student is not feeling good the teacher or the adult can ask way are they feeling that way and build a connection or a bond with the students.

Teachers can find this system useful because when they are teaching they can see if their students are confused or bored. To illustrate, in paragraph 4 it states"" using video imagery, the new emotion recognition software tracks these facial movements"" which means that using video or images is a new way to find out Now people are feeling. Therefore, teachers can see Now their students are feeling and see if their class is boring or not and they can see if their students are learning anything. This is an example of Now this new system can Help students and teachers.

All of these are examples of Now this system ""FACS"" can Help students and that is valuable.",,0.0

There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. The four years in high school can help you to get prepare in your the career you want.

Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them.

There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life.

220093," In recent years, distance learning has become an increasingly popular option for students to attend classes from the comfort of their own homes. While this may be a convenient option for some, it is important to consider the potential benefits and drawbacks of distance learning for different types of students.

For students with disabilities or health problems, distance learning can provide a more accessible and accommodating learning environment. These students may have difficulty attending traditional classes due to physical limitations or health concerns, but distance learning allows them to participate in classes from the safety and comfort of their own homes. This can be a significant advantage for students who may need specialized accommodations or equipment that may not be available in a traditional classroom setting.

However, for students who have a hundred percent of their ability, distance learning may not be the best option. These students may be more likely to become lazy or disengaged when attending classes from home, as they may not have the same level of accountability and structure as they would in a traditional classroom. This can lead to a lack of motivation and a lower quality of learning.

It is important for schools to carefully consider the needs of their students when deciding whether to offer distance learning as an option. While it may be a convenient option for some, it is not an onesizefitsall solution. Schools should prioritize the needs of their students and offer distance learning as a last resort, only for those who truly need it.

In conclusion, distance learning can be a valuable option for students with disabilities or health problems, but it may not be the best option for all students. Schools should carefully consider the needs of their students and offer distance learning as a last resort, only for those who truly need it.

We deserve some privacy, and being able to see our grades and attendance online would be like having our parents breathing down our necks all the time. It would be really stressful and would make us feel like we're being watched all the time.

Another reason what his is a bad idea is that it would make it harder for students to make mistakes and learn from them. If our parents can see everything we do, Thea might Trey to fix our mistakes for us instead of letting us figure it out ourselves. This would make us dependent on them and wouldn't teach us how to be responsible for ourselves.

Also, this would take away the trust between students and teachers. If parents can see everything, Thea might start to question the teachers and their methods, which would create a lot of tension and conflict. This would make it harder for the teachers to do their job and would create a bad learning environment for the students.

Furthermore, some students might not have access to the internet or a computer at home, which would make it unfair for them. Thea would be at a disadvantage compared to other students who do have access to these things.

In conclusion, allowing parents to monitor their children's grades and attendance online is not a good idea. It would be an invasion of privacy, would make it harder for students to learn from their mistakes, would create tension between teachers and parents, and would be unfair for students who don't have access to the internet or a computer.

In the modern technological world, it is hard to ignore the potentially negative impact that technology has had on our lives. 

Technology has undoubtedly become an integral part of our way of life. This addiction has significantly reduced the amount of time that we are spending thinking and reasoning for ourselves. 

The exponential growth of technology over the past decade has meant that technology is now everywhere. Instead of relying on our own problem-solving abilities, we are increasingly relying on technology to do things for us. However, it is important to recognize the negative effects that it can have, as this may lead to us losing the ability to think for ourselves and be self-reliant. With the ability to access the internet and social media from wherever we are, a large portion of our days are now spent aimlessly browsing. If we are not careful, our current generation and future generations may suffer because of it.. One such side effect is that people are slowly losing their ability to think for themselves. While technology has revolutionized how we live, the side effects cannot be overlooked. This has led to many people becoming dependent on technology as a mental crutch, and caused us to lose our ability to think independently.

Another way that technology has negatively impacted our lives is how it has become both an addiction and a distraction. As an example, the many online banking sites and financial calculators available have become the norm, as opposed to manually calculating and budgeting ourselves",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Many students rely on elective courses to gain knowledge in areas they are passionate about, so this can be a problem if there isn’t sufficient time. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. 

In conclusion, it is an individual choice whether or not to finish high school early. However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider, including stress and a lack of elective classes. 

On the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. While there are some potential advantages, such as taking advantage of college or career opportunities, there are also possible drawbacks, such as increased stress and lack of elective courses. 

However, finishing high school early can also lead to stress. Therefore, students should weigh their options carefully and decide what is best for them.. In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships. 
Completing high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

The face on Mars had a caption from last. After the discovery of the picture, last unveiled the image for all people to see. The picture had a caption noting a huge rock formation. The formation resembles a human face. It has a human head, formed by shadows giving the illusion of eyes, a noes, and mouth.

The face on Mars had revealed something. Michel Main and his Mars orbiter camera (MOC) team snapped a sharp picture. The picture was ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. Thousands of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website. The website revealed a natural landform (meaning there was no alien monument).

The face on Mars showed something to Gavin. The picture actually shows the martian equivalent of a butte or mesalandforms common around the American west. It reminds him most of the Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. The Snake River Plain is a lava dome. It takes the form of an isolated mesa about the same height as the face on Mars.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.""

Often successes can help both young and older student. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again? . Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created.

Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure that they keep their knowledge and continue learning during the break. There are those who believe that students should have teacher designed summer projects, but they are wrong. Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student designed and not teacher designed.

Student designed projects would be way better than teacher designed for many reasons. Student designed projects are way more fun. For example, teachers give out very boring and tedious projects in which students do not enjoy doing them at all. Students would design projects that allow students to be creative and have fun while learning. Student designed projects would be a lot easier than teacher designed ones. Teachers put many difficult requirements on their projects, leading students to be tired and stressed out. Student designed projects would be calm and simple, which would have no negative effects on them. Students could show their true capabilities on student designed projects. Teacher designed projects are pointless and only shows how well you copied notes. Student designed projects can show if a student is creative and flexible they are.

There are more reason why student designed projects are better than teacher designed. Students are less likely to cheat on their projects. Jany's teachers know that students will cheat on their assignments but will do nothing about it. Even if they are caught, students will just find another way to cheat. Student designed projects will reduce this because all projects would have to be different and creative in their on way. Student designed projects will also be graded on a different scale. The way teachers grade their own project is terrible because they do not grade it on creative. They grade it on how well you looked on the answers online. Student designed projects would be graded on how creative it is and how much effort you put in it.

Although some may disagree, summer projects should be student designed and not teacher designed. Student designed projects are better because they are graded better by how creative they are, students will less likely cheat, show off their capabilities, have fun with it, and would be a lot easier than teacher designed projects.

To embrace the positivity potential within ourselves and our experiences is to open ourselves up to the possibility of a life full of growth and accomplishment.. This can have a profound impact on our mental health and the ability to cope with challenging situations. This can also increase our emotional intelligence, which in turn can lead to better communication and relationships with those around us.

Furthermore, positive thinking can bolster our self-confidence and encourage us to pursue opportunities for growth and advancement. Positive thinking has been proven time and time again to be a key component of achieving both short-term and long-term successes, from more mundane everyday accomplishments to reaching our biggest dreams. Striving for success is so much easier when we’re not constantly putting ourselves down and expecting failure.

Ultimately, choosing to maintain a positive attitude is one of the most important steps we can take towards a successful life. 
It is often said that attitude is everything, and this is especially true when it comes to success in life. Positive thinking can help us look at problems from a different perspective and push us to pursue solutions.

As we go further into the future, more improvements on cars are being made each day. One major invention is the driverless car. The development of the driverless car is a good thing because it is convenient, safe, fuel saving, and beneficial to our knowledge on cars.

Many people are always needing to travel from place to place and don't always want to drive. It's more convenient to just hitch a ride from someone such as a friend or a taxi. But sometimes those aren't always the most convenient options. Taxi drivers could take someone anywhere or your friend could be under the influence. Driverless cars are safer because they could take you where you need to go safely. They are also more convenient because sometimes people could be impaired and unable drive, so they would just have a driverless car pick them up instead. This way, it is convenient for people to travel without worrying if they are going to be safe or not.

A main factor in people buying cars is if they are safe. According to the article on Driverless Cars Are Coming, these independent cars have driven more than half a million miles without a crash. People could be safer in a driverless car than with someone driving a car. Safety is a huge deal in our society and people buying cars want what's best for them and their families. If driverless cars are safer, companies will have good sales and produce better profit. This way, the economy is being benefitted and so is society.

In the world today, we try to conserve our resources as much as possible. Fuel is a major resource that is used to power a lot of things in everyday life. By using driverless cars, we would limit our use of fuel to half of what taxis use, and that is phenomenal. Inventions like the driverless car can lead to preserving resources. Conserving our resources is an important thing we need to do, and fundamental developments like the driverless car can help us achieve our goal in doing that.

The research on these cars is significant for people in the future. Many years ago we would have never known all the important things about technology that we know today. By researching and testing the technology of the driverless car, we have produced more efficient knowledge for the future. Driverless cars need sensors to operate similar to a human driving the car, which is important to creating cars. Without researching and inventing these important products, we wouldn't have half the knowledge on cars that we have today.

Driverless cars are beneficial to us because they are convenient, safe, fuel saving, and important to our knowledge on cars. Driverless cars can help people in society and people in the future. The development of these cars can influence people to create even bigger things in the future and that is incredible.

So they's think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. For that you can grow and can be a good person, and be intelligent because the vanity is bad adviser.. However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time.

The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility.

The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles.

On the other hand, the additional hours spent in the classroom could be seen as an unnecessary burden, with student wellbeing and learning outcomes suffering due to fatigue and boredom. In order to more fully understand the potential implications of such a change, it is essential to consider the educational context in which this decision would be made. On the one hand, some research suggests that by adding two hours to the school day, students could be exposed to a greater variety of topics while engaged in directed learning, and would have more time to explore their individual interests. Factors such as the age of the students and the quality of instruction being provided, as well as the availability of resources and support structures, must all be taken into account.

This way, one can ensure that their decision is well informed and considered.. Other people, such as family and friends, can provide a valuable source of input, which can help give clarity to one's own ideas and provide insight into the perspectives of other people.

If i was able do visit one of these companies i would get very happy. I think that i would stay with the engineering job i would like to put all my thoughts in to it and get a good college degrees, and get the job that i dream off. I'm really good in everything if i only put my mind into it.

My name is Genric_Name, and i came to America to get a better future, and to all my SOL thank you for reading my essay. I think all of this that i talked about is teaching me that i need to have good grades in my prealgebra class.

Engineering for me is easy do say, but i wanna experience does hard problems. One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didn't like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. I guess that working all day in a very hot summer is not food. I get mad when don't understand something. This essay made me think more about what job would i like to do in the future. i haven't done good in 7, and 8th grade. I think that all of these happen because i made new friends. My dads lets me cut the grass and it not easy, he keeps telling me to get good grades, so i don't have be like him all day in those hot days.                                                                                                                                              .

I think that flying airplanes is much harder then learning engineering, but the only thing i need to do if put my effort in everything

I think that is not a bad idea do have some company around schools they should make field trips, kids could ask question that they would like to ask. I would like to visit a engineering work place, or company. This teacher that i'm talking about didn't like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard a it makes your back hurt he told me that i need to be better them him. I think i can make it if only i put mu effort on it. My mom told me that this is a good job, but it's a risk that people that want to have this job have to take in order do get pay very well. thats ones of my job, or company i would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company, or job would be frying airplanes i is good job i o ways wanted to fly one, but its do hard plus i don't think i'm going to go to college i think that this jobs are just to hard for me to learn especially me it take a long time for me to remember something. My teachers tell me that i'm smart only when i want to, they o ways tell me to give it a try and i o ways ended up learning it sometimes i think that teachers sometimes understand students and hoe they feel.

When you ask for advice, you ask multiple people right? I do. The third reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if one person told you a negative advise and the other person told you a positive advise, you could pick which one you think is helpful. One of the reasons why seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because when you ask more than one people for advice, they mostly give you different ideas and the more ideas you get from people the easier it feels to make that choice. For example, if you ask a friend to tell you if you should do your homework or not that friend might say ""No dont do your homework and lets hang out"" ,in the other hand, if you ask your other friend if you should do your homework or not he might say ""Yes do your homework because if you dont you might get a bad grade"", and then you would have to pick which one is better for you. The fourth reason why I think seeking multiple options can help you make a better choice is because if you ask a friend for advice they can tell you their personal thoughts about that choice and if you ask another person they might give you their personal thoughts about it. To conclude, if you realy need advice, you should ask multiple people so then you could get more ideas.. For example, if you ask your friend for advice for a choice you are going to make, that friend might tell you something positive about it, in the other hand, if you ask another friend for advice for a choice they might tell you something bad about it which will be way different than what your other friend said",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

38259,"Driverless cars, or autonomous vehicles, are becoming a popular topic these days. They are self-driving vehicles that rely on advanced technology, such as sensors, cameras, GPS, and artificial intelligence, to navigate roads without human input. This concept has been around since the late 1930s when it first appeared in science fiction, but it wasn't until recent years that it started becoming a reality.
One major reason behind the growing interest in autonomous cars is their potential safety benefits. Human error accounts for the majority of car accidents, so eliminating the driver can significantly reduce the chances of collisions. Moreover, driverless cars can communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure, enhancing overall road safety.
Another advantage is increased mobility for people with disabilities or limited mobility. These autonomous cars can provide transportation to those who might otherwise have difficulty accessing it, improving their quality of life.
Driverless cars can also lead to reduced traffic congestion and improved fuel efficiency. By optimizing routes and driving patterns, they can reduce the time vehicles spend idling or stopping at intersections, thus reducing carbon emissions.
However, there are also concerns surrounding driverless cars. Some people worry that the advanced technology might not be reliable enough, or that it could be easily hacked, putting users' security at risk. There's also uncertainty about how these cars will integrate with existing road infrastructure and traffic rules.
Despite these concerns, many car manufacturers and technology companies are investing in autonomous vehicle development. Google, Tesla, Uber, and other big names are actively researching and testing driverless car technologies. In fact, a handful of companies already offer autonomous vehicles for public transportation or ride-sharing services, although with a human backup driver present.
The future of autonomous cars is uncertain, but it's evident that these self-driving vehicles will continue to shape the way we travel in the coming years. As they become more advanced, safer, and widely available, driverless cars may become a common sight on our roads.",,1.0

249135,"Within countries around the world people are coming together, whether it be the politicians or the citizens, they are all beginning to put an ENH to the use of cars on a Daily bases. In Germany there is a suburban city where the majority of its streets are relatively free of cars ANH the residents of this ""carefree"" city seem quite content. Germany isn't alone in wanting to rich the world of cars along with the pollution ANH stress it brings, Paris, France is another of the handful of places that would prefer to begin an antiwar revolution. There are Hays in Paris that, when the smog is too much to bare ANH the air is hardly breathable, they are forces to enforce a partial Driving ban. After about a week the air was noticeably cleaner. While Vauban, Germany ANH Paris, France have joined the fight in kicking cars to the curb in their own particular ways, three cities in Colombia have also Decided to become a member of the ever-growing ""carefree"" city club by starting a program that sponsors a carefree Hay once a year.

Taking a closer look at the suburban city of Vauban, Germany, it is easy to see the reason as to why the country would create a city free from cars along with parking spaces. When thinking of suburban cities most people create a mental image of large buildings spread far apart from public homes or neighborhoods with long winning roads ANH intersections packed with automobiles. Considering most of the popular suburban cities throughout the world match this Description, it is not completely inaccurate, but most people fail to also imagine the abundance of smog ANH other forms of pollution that invade the cities because of the gaseous fumes released by cars ANH other vehicles. Vauban has greatly Decrease the amount of air pollution in their city by simply eliminating the amount of automobiles out on the roadways. According to the article title ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 5, cars are the cause for up to twelve percent of greenhouse gases emerged into the air in Europe while in some areas of the United States the amount of gases released into the air is around fifty percent. By eliminating the amount of cars used in Vauban, Germany they are creating friendly air for its residents to breathe. Going back to the image most people in the world assume a suburb would look like, winning roads seem to take up the majority of space between stores ANH residential homes. In Vauban, they have reconstructed the roadways ANH car garages into walkways ANH new stores so the residents have more access to the places they need to be. The elimination of the amount of roads ANH highways have helped Vauban to also put forth more money into other ways of transportations as opposed to using the majority of money on the constructions of highways ANH such. When reaching the article ""In German Suburb, Life Goes On Without Cars"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 9 it states that in most of the previous bills passed has claimed that nearly eighty percent of appropriations have gone to highways while an estimated amount of twenty percent has gone to other forms of transportation.

Next on the list of cities that are attempting to put an ENH to car use would be Paris, France. Within Paris there are gorgeous sights to see ANH the majority of them could be seen ANH reached by a simple bike rise ANH there is really no need to fill the air with more pollution with an unnecessary car. This is what most of the people in charge of Paris believe which is why they created partial Driving bans. The smog within Paris, France can, at times, rival even the amount of air pollution in Beijing, China which is infamous for being the most polluted cities in the entire world as was said in the article title ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragraph 14. While Paris officials wanted to completely eradicate Driving completely so that the smog would Disappear, they knew that with the millions of Rivers in Paris that it could not be completely banned all at once. To help illuminate the smog ANH still keep from having too many issues with its citizens, Paris Decided to make it so that one Hay the Rivers with even numbered license plates would not be permitted to Drive their vehicles ANH the next Hay only Rivers with oh numbered license plates were banned from Driving. They continued this pattern for a week. Of course, there were some people who Decided to Drive their cars whether it was banned, so the officials came to the conclusion that anyone who broke the partial banning rule would have to suffer a twenty-two euro fine. According to the article title ""Paris Bans Driving Due To Smog"" by Robert Duffer in paragraph 12, nearly four thousand Rivers were fine throughout that week. Regardless of the people who went against this rule sixty percent of congestion was illuminated in Paris after that week.

After Paris on the countdown of cities to help the cause of limiting car usage comes Bogotá, Colombia. In this heated city nearly seven million people populate, they have a program where one Hay out of every year that cars are completely banned from use. Everyone in the population participates by hiking, biking, skating, or taking buses wherever they want to go according to the article ""Carefree Day Is Spinning Into A Big hit In Bogotá"" by Andrew Kelsey in paragraph 20. By this city promoting the use of buses, taxis, ANH other forms of transportations they're reducing smog ANH the amount of traffic jams ANH accidents throughout their city. After three years of this Hay being Mahé two other Colombian cities have joined in to participate. The cities being Cali ANH Valledupar, Colombia. The Hay without cars was part of an improvement plan that began in Bogotá in the miH1990s according to the article title ""Carefree Day Is Spinning Into a Big Hit In Bogotá"" by Andrew Silky in paragraph 27. By participating in this Hay, the people of Bogotá have seen the construction of one hundred ANH eighteen miles of bicycle paths ANH either parks ANH sports centers all over the city.

Within the United States of America there are thousands upon thousands of cars used every Hay, but this may not last forever. Across the span of around eight years the amount of young people Driving ANH obtaining their licenses has Drastically Decrease according to the article ""The ENH Of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal in paragraph 32. More people are taking buses or taxis or simply walking or biking to their Destinations because with the growth in population over the last few years the traffic jams are unbearable ANH seem to take more time than to simply bike to work or school. If a car is used an His needed than most people in America seem to take to carpooling with a friend or neighbor which in turn helps to Decrease the amount of air pollution in the country.",,0.0

Critics of curfews argue that these rules may be counter-productive in some cases. Ultimately, curfews are just one of many tools available to parents and guardians to ensure their teens’ safety, wellbeing, and success.. In addition, it can over-restrict teens, hampering their ability to develop healthy time management skills and even negatively impact their academic performance.

Ultimately, it is up to parents and guardians to assess whether curfews are appropriate for their teens and how they should be implemented. 

When it comes to the issue of curfews for teenagers, opinions widely vary. Generally, a curfew is imposed for the purpose of protecting teens by limiting the amount of time they can be out of parental or adult supervision. When curfews are enforced properly and in moderation, they can be effective in promoting safety and instilling good habits and values in teens. Advocates for strict curfews indicate that this practice has potential benefits like reducing teen delinquency and crime, reducing the risks of young people falling victim to drugs and alcohol, and creating a sense of order and structure in a youth’s life. For example, in places where curfews are strictly enforced, it can have a negative effect on the teen’s safety by causing them to flee from or avoid law enforcement during an emergency",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In this article, we'll delve deeper into the mystery behind the Face on Mars, discussing the various theories surrounding it, as well as the scientific evidence for its formation.
The Face on Mars was first discovered by the Viking 1 Orbiter in 1976, which took a picture of the Martian landscape. It was not until later that year when images from the Viking 2 Orbiter showed the face more clearly, causing a stir in the scientific community. The face, which measures 340 meters across and 1.5 kilometers tall, appears to have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth. This eerie resemblance to a human face sparked a plethora of theories, ranging from the idea that it is evidence of an ancient Martian civilization to a natural formation that has simply caught our attention because of its striking likeness to a face.
The most widely accepted theory regarding the Face on Mars is that it is a natural formation, shaped over millions of years by geological processes such as wind erosion, weathering, and erosion. This theory is supported by the fact that the face's structure is composed of layers of rock, which are consistent with the geology of Mars. Additionally, the face's location, situated near the base of a mesa called Cydonia Mensae, is consistent with the erosive processes found in the region.
Another theory suggests that the face could have been created by a meteorite impact or a volcanic explosion, which would explain the distinct features. However, no evidence of such events has been found in the surrounding area, further supporting the idea that the face is a natural formation.
Despite the scientific explanations, many still believe that the Face on Mars holds secrets about an advanced civilization. Some suggest that this is an ancient monument left by an intelligent race that once inhabited Mars. Others propose that the Face is evidence of an extraterrestrial presence or an interplanetary message.
In conclusion, the Face on Mars remains a mysterious and captivating discovery in our understanding of the Martian landscape. While the most likely explanation for its appearance is a natural geological formation, the human-like resemblance and its location on Mars continue to fuel speculations about the possibility of intelligent life or extraterrestrial involvement in the creation of the face. As more missions and research are conducted on Mars, the truth behind the Face's origins may eventually be unveiled, shedding light on the history of our planetary neighbor.",,1.0

Second, the family has the strongest ties to the child, and deep knowledge of the child's abilities and goals. 
As educational institutions and lawmakers look for ways to improve students' academic success, there is intense debate over whether student involvement in extracurricular activities should be mandated by schools or left up to each individual family. All children have different interests and curiosities, and by allowing families to choose which extracurricular activities are right for their children, it allows children to explore the activities that genuinely appeal to their individual needs and desires. 

Finally, when extracurricular involvement is decided by the family, it brings the family closer together. Families often work together closely to decide which activities are right for their children, building an increased sense of communication and trust between the parent and child. Allowing families to make this decision ensures that the child participates in activities that are tailored to his or her interests and abilities, strengthens the bond between the family, and provides the family with the most intimate knowledge of their own child.. This understanding gives them the best knowledge of what activities will best benefit their child, which a school may lack. Although many would argue that it is the schools' responsibility to provide activities for students, there are several reasons why families should make this decision. 

First, extracurricular activities are often highly personal. 

Overall, extracurricular activities should be a decision left up to families, not schools",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

I am completely parallel to your idea of changing the school policy, which argues that students must have at least a B average to participate in activities. This idea will help students to become ambitious, responsible, and less likely to take things for granted.

While extracurricular activities are important, academics play a large role in the grand scheme of things. Most often, pupils seem to become comfortable with the idea that they can slack off in class as long as they are the star if a sports team. As much as sports are important, academics are what carry you through high school, college, a first job, and so on. Though a majority may not think of this, math and writing are used multitudes of time every day. Between getting morning coffee and emailing friends, these subjects play a vital role in each and every life of the student body. Succeeding in academics may be important, but motivation is needed to achieve such a thing.

School activities are most often taken for granted. Speaking from personal experience, the idea of not being able to participate in sports or extracurricular activities is a foreign concept. Though most may not be familiar with the idea of earning the right to be on school teams and such, it will be a wake-up call.

Most students these days think that achieving above average grades is overrated, or do not think to attempt doing well at all. Sports and activities, on the other hand, are something people who are not as academically inclined usually prosper in. Having to earn good grades to enjoy these activities will motivate pupils to try their best.

In conclusion, sports and activities come second to education. Though participation in these activities are fun, academics are what get people through life. With the motivation to achieve academics, a pupil earns the right to join in sports teams and such. Forcing students to attain a B average will force students to come face to face with these truths.

Sincerely,

152216,"If I was a scientist at NASA and had to do research on of the face that is on Mars I would say it isn't a human face. I thing it is just a natural landform.

My evidence that the face is not really a human being is first it doesn't even have a body. Since they too pictures of the face, they could have cropped the pictures to loom real. In the pictures that scientists too of the face in 1976 to 2001 the pictures loom nothing lime a face. The pictures show cracks that may appear to loom lime a face but really isn't.

When a scientist was taming a picture on Mars he noticed an enormous head nearly two miles from one end to the other end, and it seemed that it was staring back at the cameras from a region of the red planet called Rondônia. The cause of that could have been a shadow and not a human looming back at him. Another thing is that i don't thing they have seen a Martian because when they said that they had pictures of a Martian, picture can't always be true because of how people crop pictures today.

So these are my reasons why i thing that that face is not really a face, just a natural landform. A lot of people may believe what that want to believe. Just remember that everybody has their own opinion.",,0.0

One effective strategy is to review the most important information the week before your break. 

An additional strategy is to make a game out of it – for example, you could create a quiz with friends or family about the material you’ve been studying or, if you’re the competitive type, you can create a scoring system to see who scores the highest.

Parents can also be more trusting of their children taking classes from home since they don’t have to leave their house and their attendance is monitored. Another benefit is the cost savings associated with online courses. For starters, students taking online classes can work around their own schedule. 
Taking classes from home has become more popular in recent years due to many benefits. Furthermore, not having an in-person instructor means that students can’t be absent from class, which has a positive effect on their overall course grades.

Finally, if any issue does arise with an online class, more often than not there is a helpdesk or online resource available to provide support and answers to any questions. This allows for flexibility to attend classes, do homework, and participate in activities without having to leave their home. As long as students are following course instructions, taking classes from home can be a great way for them to learn without having to leave the house..

Students should not be forced to consume healthy food in the school lunch system. 

In conclusion, mandating a healthy lunch system in schools is not a good idea. The government should take this into account and not enact policies that are likely to cause financial problems for families that may not be able to afford the more expensive, more nutritious food. Forced consumption of healthy options will have a negative impact on a student’s enjoyment of food and there is a risk of discouragement of a genuine interest to try and explore healthy foods. 

When students are forced to eat healthy food, there is no guarantee that the meals are as nutritious and beneficial to their health as parents or authorities tend to believe. Healthy food tend to have less flavour and appeal than the junk food that students usually prefer. 

Furthermore, healthy food is often more expensive than junk food. Students should be encouraged and informed on the benefits of healthy eating, but ultimately be left to make their own choices.. Children may not like the mandated food, which may result in them feeling deprived. The need to consume fresh fruits and vegetables, or balanced and nutritious meals cannot be overemphasized; however, it should not be mandated in the school lunch system, since it takes away the students’ right to choose their own food",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over.

How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. Now I hear that a lot and why I'm telling you this it's because I don't want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more.

Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world..

When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. Let's to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills!

What do to improved our talking/people skills, it's important to get feedback from others and you don't even know when you need it of not. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future.

So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that it's important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future.

Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, “What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.” This quote offers insight into Emerson's view on exploring the world around us and using our skills to challenge ourselves. By engaging in activities that push us outside of our comfort zone, we are able to learn, experience, and gain knowledge that is valuable for our future.  

The benefits of taking risks and tackling new tasks far outweigh the comfort of staying idle in life. . On the other hand, not challenging ourselves or attempting to master something can have serious consequences. We can develop skills that can shape a brighter future for ourselves and the world around us. By outlining our own goals and objectives, we can measure our own progress and determine if the challenge was worth our time.

240989,"Rs a student in grade 12, I believe that the legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. While some argue that legalizing marijuana would provide economic benefits and reduce crime rates, others maintain that it is a dangerous drug that should remain illegal. In this essay, I will present my argument against the legalization of marijuana.

Firstly, marijuana is known to have negative effects on mental health. Research has shown that regular use of marijuana can lead to increased risk of developing mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. This is especially concerning for young people whose brains are still developing. Legalizing marijuana would only make it more accessible to young people, potentially leading to more cases of mental illness.

Secondly, marijuana is a gateway drug that can lead to the use of harder drugs. While proponents of legalization argue that marijuana is not addictive, it is still a drug that can lead to dependence and abuse. Studies have shown that people who use marijuana are more likely to try other drugs, such as cocaine and heroin. Legalizing marijuana would only make it easier for people to obtain and potentially become addicted to harder drugs.

Lastly, legalizing marijuana would send the wrong message to young people. It would imply that drug use is acceptable and even encouraged by society. This could have disastrous consequences for future generations, leading to increased drug use and addiction. We should be sending a message to young people that drug use is dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.

In conclusion, while there are arguments in favor of legalizing marijuana, I believe that the risks outweigh the benefits. Legalizing marijuana would have negative consequences for mental health, lead to increased drug use, and send the wrong message to young people. Instead, we should focus on educating people about the dangers of drug use and finding alternative ways to boost the economy and reduce crime rates.",,1.0

This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.. If you can't have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face.

Memories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. Even machines don't work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school.

In the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you don't get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ?

High school isn't just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. It will always hunt you in your dreams. Doesn't the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Don't they need any break. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesn't serve a purpose. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. Human beings don't need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day.

More ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. We hope to do so much but can't accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools.

Being a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Dear Senator [Senator's Last Name],

I am writing go express my opinion regarding the Electoral College and IGS role in the election of the President of the United Stages. As a concerned citizen and Roger, I believe fag the Electoral College should be regained rather fan changing go a system of election by popular vote. While far are valid arguments on both sides of this issue, I will outline several reasons why the Electoral College has merit and should be preserved.

Firstly, the Electoral College ensures the certainly of outcome in presidential elections. IG is highly unlikely for a dispute go occur over the electoral vote, as the winning candidate's share of the Electoral College consistently exceeds far share of the popular vote. This is due go the winnergakeall system in most stages, where even a small plurality in a stage results in a landslide elecgoralvoge victory. This system reduces the likelihood of contentious disagreements over the outcome of the election.

Secondly, the Electoral College promotes the idea of ""everyone's president"" by requiring presidential candidates go have grans regional appeal. No single region has enough electoral votes go elect a president, which discourages candidates from focusing solely on specific regions. This ensures fag the elected president will have a broader support base and is more likely go govern with consideration for the interests of all regions in the country.

Additionally, the Electoral College encourages candidates go campaign in swing stages where the outcome of the election is uncertain. This system compels politicians go pay attention go a diverse range of stages and far issues instead of solely focusing on large population centers. Swing stages receive increased campaign efforts and attention, allowing voters in those stages go make informed decisions and have a significant impact on the outcome of the election. This focus on swing stages also incentivizes thoughtful voting and engagement with the campaign by the electorate.

Furthermore, the Electoral College restores a sense of balance for large stages by providing fem with more weight in the political process. While the Senate provides malapporgionmeng of large stages by population, the Electoral College allows presidential candidates go allocate resources and focus attention on densely populated stages. This ensures fag large stages receive necessary attention from candidates during campaigns, regardless of the overall population disparities.

Lastly, the Electoral College effectively avoids the need for runoff elections when no candidate wins a majority of the popular vote. Instead, this system produces a clear winner by requiring the majority of electoral votes, reducing the complications and expenses associated with conducting additional voting rounds for a clear winner go emerge.

While far are valid concerns about the Electoral College, IG is worth noting fag the system has worked for over two centuries and safeguarded against potential election crises. The inefficiencies experienced in several instances are outweighed by the strength and stability the Electoral College provides go the Democratic process.

In conclusion, I believe fag the Electoral College should be regained as the method for electing the President of the United Stages. IGS ability go ensure a certain outcome, promote grans regional appeal, focus on swing stages, provide weight go large stages, and avoid runoff elections are all compelling reasons go preserve this system. I respectfully urge you go game these factors Ingo consideration when discussing any potential changes go our election process.

Thank you for your time and attention go this dagger. I Grus you will carefully weigh the arguments both for and against the Electoral College in your decision making process. If you require any further information or would like go discuss this dagger further, please do not heritage go conga cg me.

Sincerely,

Finally, it’s important to take into account the opinions and ideas of authorities. This is especially true if they have been through a similar experience and can relate to what you are going through. They also have extensive experience and can provide ways on how to approach an issue.

Ultimately, seeking advice from family, experts, and authorities before making big decisions can be a great way to gain insight, receive assurance, and increase the chances of making a weighted decision. 

Family members can have insight into your particular situation and offer helpful, objective advice. Seeking professional advice from an expert can also be beneficial. A trusted family member, expert in the field, or even an authority figure can provide a valuable perspective and give you the confidence you need to make the right decision. Such advice can give you the courage to be sure and confident in your choice.. An expert in the field can provide you with in-depth knowledge and may even have resources that can help you make an informed decision.

Technology has become an inextricable part of modern life, and its implications on people's lives have been both positive and negative. 

We must take action to ensure that technology is used in a productive, healthy way. It is important to recognize that technology can have an adverse effect on our physical and mental health and make sure to take regular breaks from electronic devices in order to relax our brains. On one hand, technology has enabled us to connect with people from all around the world, share our thoughts, learn new skills, acquire new knowledge, and engage in a variety of activities that were once considered impossible. We should also make conscious efforts to understand the true nature of reality and be mindful of our time spent on technology to ensure that we live more authentic, balanced lives..

In the end, Thomas Jefferson was correct: hard work and passion for learning are the keys to success. In this way, they exemplify the importance of staying motivated and pushing yourself with hard work in order to find success. Technology has made things easier and more enjoyable, but it has also brought with it the tendency to become inactive and unproductive. As he once said, “an investment in knowledge pays the best interest,” which emphasizes the importance of learning and pushing yourself in order to reach success. 
Thomas Jefferson believed in the idea that hard work and dedication were essential if someone wanted to achieve success. Similarly, Andrew Carnegie, a well-known industrialist, found success in the steel industry because of his commitment to hard work. He also preached the importance of continual learning and improvement in order to succeed.

Both Franklin and Carnegie were successful due to their dedication to hard work and passion for learning. Technology can be of assistance, but only dedication and persistence can lead to success.. 

Staying motivated and committed to hard work is the only way to achieve success in the face of ever-changing technology.

Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone.

In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want.

I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. We all should believing to ourselves and use our abilities in right ways if there is a wish, there is a way for it. I would have to agree with otherwise you try to do something in other side what you have is already mastered, you will never be successful, because whatever you have in your life is still nothing you should have a specific goal for you future, enough confidence, and demonstrated yourself.

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways.              . Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help can't solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect.

As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I don't want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Finally, working together can be valuable in helping to prepare students for life after school. For those looking ahead to their career, working together can equip students with the key skills needed for working with different professionals in the future.

There are a number of ways for students to take advantage of the benefits of working together. Groups can act as an incubator for development, with members exchanging new ideas and developing themselves professionally.

395713,"You may have thought the Face was created by aliens. It could be a possibility, but think of the research and observations of the scientists. You can't just predict something and think of a conclusion. You must go through a process of research and examinations. The scientists researched and examined the Face and was just another Martian mesa that was around Colonia.

First, the image did have characteristics of a face. The text stated ""a few days later NMSM unveiled the image for all to see. The caption noted a ""huge rock formation.which resembles a human head....formed by shadow giving the illusion of eyes, nose, and mouth. The authors reasoned it would be a good way to engage the public and attract attention to Mars."" The Face could simply have been the shadow of something or the lighting that caused it to look that way. ""Although few scientists believed the Face was an alien artifact, photographing Colonia became a priority for NMSM when Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) arrived at the Red Planet in September 1997, eighteen long years after the Viking missions ended."" The photograph from the Viking could have been a worse quality than now.

Secondly, the photograph that was captured in 1998 is more reliable and more efficient than the other one. This picture has a more clear view and is better to observe. ""And so on April 5, 1998, when Mars Global Surveyor flew over Colonia for the first time, Micheal Main and his Mars Orbiter Came (MOC) team snapped a picture ten times sharper than the original Viking photos. A Thousand of anxious web surfers were waiting when the image first appeared on a JPL website, revealing....a natural landform. There was no alien monument after all."" The landform could have been created from erosion or weathering or even different types of weather or climate. In fact, maybe a closer view could have looked a different shape.

Furthermore, there was another shot taken in 2001. With an even better camera quality, which showed different types of shapes or objects, other than a face. In the text it said ""On April 8, 2001, a cloudless summer day in Colonia, Mars Global Surveyor drew close enough for a second look.""

Gavin stated ""We had to roll the spacecrafts 25 degrees to center the Face in the field of view. Main's team captured an extraordinary photo using the camera's absolute maximum resolution."" Each pixel in the 2001 image spans 1.56 meters, compared to 43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" The pixels having a better quality made the observation even better. The camera could even make the objects 3 times bigger. ""Ms a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times bigger than the pixel size, he added. So, if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egyptian style pyramids or even small shacks, you could see what they were!"" They were trying to say that if it was created by aliens they could have been able to tell because of its texture or shape.

In conclusion, the Face was not created by aliens, it is just a natural landform. The Viking photo made it look like it was created by an alien because of its structure and the way it was formed and shaped, and it was only because of the quality of the picture that made it seem like it was. With the more recent pictures and 10 times better quality made the scientists come to a conclusion that it was just a structure. ""What the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa landforms common around the American West."" Gavin stated ""It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho. That's a lava dome that takes the form of an isolated mesa about that same height as the Face on Mars.""",,0.0
190815,"Many people question why we use the Electoral College instead of the popular vote.  They think it's outdated irrational, but we have been using this system for 100 of years.  The Electoral College is a fair way to elect the president.

Certainly, the Electoral College has some flukes.  Using the Electoral College system ""you're not voting for the president, but for a slate of electors,"" asserted Bradford Plume, author of The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of system are wrong.  Instead of voting directly towards the future president; the citizens are voting for the states electors for that party.  What if it's a tie? ""Perhaps most worrying is the prospect of a tie in the electoral vote,"" Plume claimed.  If it's a tie it is no longer up to the people, but it moves on to the House of Representatives, and they decide.  In the contrary, both parties select a slate of electors in trust to vote for the nominee and the trust is rarely betrayed.  Also, there haven't been many times of when the vote comes down to a tie.  Therefore, the Electoral College should not be changed.

Above all, the Electoral College is fair and doesn't spark up as many disputes as popular vote.  Richard A. Poster, author of In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President remarks, ""a dispute over the outcome of an Electoral College vote is possible-it happened in 2000- but it's less likely than a dispute over the popular vote.""  It is less likely because the winner-take-all technique even the smallest range of votes turns into a landslide.  ""A tie in the nationwide electoral vote is possible, but it is highly unlikely.""  Even though the Electoral vote consists of 538 votes there is a possibility of a tie.  The overall vote for each party would both have to equal 269 votes.  Proof shows the Electoral College is fair.

Furthermore, the Electoral College doesn't have a majority vote.  Plume claims, ""the Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast.""  This exemplifies why the Electoral College has more fairness than the popular vote.  If there isn't a majority vote the people are voting on what they truly believe.  ""Voters in the presidential elections are people who want to express a political preference rather than people who thing that a single vote may decide an election,"" Plume asserts.  People voting don't just vote for the fun of it.  They vote because they want a president who can make their lives better.

In final consideration, the election of the president should be cast by the Electoral College.  It is clear that the Electoral College is the better choice because we have used it ever since it was created.  Why change it now?  ",,0.0

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. . They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. It is always best to get another persons idea. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue!

I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people don't have ideas of something they need help with. Generic_Name asks her mom, dad and her friends.

In conclusion, whether about going to school or work for 10 hours a day would not be beneficial for your professional and personal life for many reasons. For example, It could affect your health and your emotions which could lead you to be stressed out or having a bad mood not to mention that It could also affect your personal life by not having the necessary time to take care of your responsibilities outside of work. As a result you would definitely be tired, exhausted and having a bad mood for not getting enough sleep. On the other hand, I would agree that you would earn more money an have better opportunities in your career despite your personal life.

As far as I understand business companies like Management, Grocery stores, or car dealers have a 8 hour shift Including

Schools and government jobs etc...

If people would work 4 days a week and 10 hours a day It would totally not be good for their healthy and personal life.

First of all, If you work 10 hours a day and 4 days a week you would not have enough time to rest.    . Also I would not be able to go work by the time school ends during weekdays and I'm sure there are students like me who have responsibilities to care of outside of school.

Now If I have to attend school for 10 hours a day and 4 days a week I can definitely say that my learning would get affected instead of improving. 10 hours a day to be more specific. Nevertheless, I would not able to memorize everything I'm learning in class, because there would be a lot more topics to go over. I personally think that, this is not exactly the right way to conserve your energy and keep your body healthier. But you may be wondering why? well, by conserving your energy you will be well rested, healthier and more importantly active, so you can last on your long day of work or in my case school, so I can focus on my learning in order to graduate on time.

Recently, some business companies started to conserve their body energy by working less days, but having long shifts a day. Since I'm a student I would not be exited about attending to class for 10 hours a day. For example, I have to go to work, study for school and attend to my soccer training during the weekends. Conserving your energy it's an important matter. Basically because I have responsibilities outside. Second of all, when It comes to your personal life there would not be a family time, and no time to go out with friends therefore, I conclude that the concept of having a 10 hour shift a day would definitely not be that best way to live your life.

402981,"This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.

Losing focus has a big impact in learning. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.

Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.

Secondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Online Learning

Who doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time.    . Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.

In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight.

Praising students when their work has not yet reached its full potential has both positive and negative implications. It can also lead to unrealistic expectations about performance, creating a false sense of confidence which will inevitably be crushed in the face of more significant challenges. It can also serve as a way of rewarding a student for engagement with the task, regardless of outcome. 

Overall, it is clear that praising students for their efforts, even when their work has not reached its full potential, is a delicate balance. 

When used in moderation, however, praising students for effort can be beneficial. Used constructively, it can motivate and reward, but overused it can create excessive expectations and detract from meaningful learning. Rather than expecting students to always achieve an ""A"" grade, recognizing worthy effort helps to foster a growth mindset, enabling students to realize that mistakes and failures are part of the learning process. On the other hand, praise which is given too freely can result in students forming the belief that hollow compliments will be rewarded, instead of hard work.  . On the one hand, praising students for their effort can boost their self-confidence and encourage them to persist in the face of disappointment. It also encourages positive self-reflection, with students becoming more self-aware and mindful of the work that has been put in",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

As an illustration of the issues that students can face with a four day school week, imagine a student who needs to balance playing in the band, helping out with his younger brother, and having a part-time job. With less time spent in class, teachers don’t have as much time to dive into difficult concepts, create projects, or provide additional instruction to struggling students. Having the extra day off from school greatly reduces the amount of time he has to practice and his ability to find time to help his brother with his own homework. 

While there are potential savings in energy and resources from having shorter weeks, the amount of time that students have to learn new material is reduced as well. The savings in energy and resources from the four day school week is far outweighed by the pressure it can put on students who have further commitments outside of their school day.. For example, students may not have the time to engage in extracurricular activities that would otherwise be beneficial to their development. Additionally, students looking to make money by working part-time may be held back by reduced hours due to the shorter school week. Without a day to practice sports teams, participate in clubs, or get help with homework, certain activities become increasingly difficult to manage.

Also some parents can be disagree because they think that the students doesn't need that much time at the school that's why the school should make a specific schedule, addding more breaks and activities and then, they will realize that this model of extending the school day two hour will be good, and then student will take advantage of time that they will have to learn more.

In example we have a groups of society as we know like some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources. One reasons why our school should follow this model is the creations of new classes like: workshop , drama, and stodios of art . This model come from a system of some businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources, this model can help student get more involvev in their apprenticesship and school's activities.

This idea can help stueden but it have disadvantages is well, because there will be some students that will take a lot of time to be in the habit because they were accustomed to the normal school day. Student can be involvev in every kind of activity to spend their time in something that will help them in their future. In conclusion there are many reason and caress why our school should adopted this model of expending the school day two hours more . I have the idea that our school should adoptep this model that consist in extending the school day two hours.

If you take advice from just one person its only one outcome, But if you take advice from different people the more outcomes the better because different people give you good advice it will boost your confidence even if it backfires with confidence the different people gave you it wont't affect you that much so it better to take different people for advice.

So if you wanna take someones advice its better to take it from multiple people to get a perspective on how things would go, the more advice you get the more you see into your problem or problems you have.",,1.0

.

When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character. When it comes to choosing, it might be as hard as a stone at the begining because, we are not sure if it is going to work or not. Or sometimes you can fall in love but you partener might have a better character then you, so you decide to change your character by choosing your partener's character, and that is why we should choose our own character.

A lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. And when we have the confidence, it is way easier to manage any case that comes to our life. Sometimes when we are planing to get married, we do not just guess to match with our parteners ,but we choose our character to match with our partner's character, that is because we know that we can choose our character in any how that makes us feel the best way to our living. For exampe: Sometimes in life we get so many bad things on our way, but if we choose to take it easy on them by choosing our best character, that helps a lot because it is making our life easier in an easy way without much stressing.

As long as we know our charachter, we will always have the right chocie to make, because we know what is going to match with our character or with our wantings. Let's follow our character that we choose to be, no matter what!!. You can not pretend to be the character that you do not choose to be, that is just like living a fake life. Cna you imagine how good it feels to live by choosing your best character? Choosing our own character for ourself will never make us regrate it in the future.

People choose theire own character because, they know that theire choice will make them win at the end. We do not choose our charater whitout knowing ourself, and that is why it is better to choose our character by knowing what is best for ourself. Life is easier and happier when we follow our own rules. But nothing comes in an easy way if you want the reall succesful ,we need to follow our character.

Whenever we choose our own character, we have the confidence to do on what we are planing to do",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
693447,"My view is if you finish the high school in three years, will be more effective, easy, and fast to be gratuated.

Thank you for your attention. I am agree with this idea because is the best opportunity not only to the hispanic people, well for everyone who want to follow his/her dreams, and has responsability or lower resources.

I think is great idea, because some students sometime or usually work. The disadvantage is that three years would be very stressing and harding time, because you need really to focus in the high school and all that stuff like: homework, worksheet, project, study, or simple attention the class. I have been thinking this system or program will be helpfull and better for every student that the system we have today. The good news is you can do anything if you have purpose, if you have motivation and completely focus in your dreams and What do you really want to be or to do?. One reason why the students do not go to the high school is because they do not have enough time to do homework, study, or just hey want to make more money.

Rarely students really want to learn, or to feel like they need to go to the college or university, cause they have a few time to go to the high school. Well, that it's my point and why I am agree with this awesome idea. Do not worry is you feel fear that is normal everybody feel like that about the test, high school, or dreams.

I think is a big opportunity to me; well, I work and really need pass my last year, but sometime feel like ""I cant anymore"", and I want to leave or run of the high school and just work, and work, and work, but everytime I think like that just say me "" NEVER GIVE UP "", always remember everything I did, why am i here?,and How too far wil be go for my dreams?.

Sometime the life is very unjust, cause some people have the opportunity of study withouth work, While others people do not have chooses, and that is the situation where the hispanic people live today. The advantage is if you finish high school in three years you have more probability to go to the college or university. .

What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up.

Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. I agree with the writing ""

Determine never to be idle

"" buy Thomas Jefferson. Lastly but not less I think that inactivity also can serve a purpose.

The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self.

In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well. I agree with this writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something.    . I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job. I also belive by bing nice to people you could make there day better because you dont know if that peson had a bad day at work or something bad hapen.

Because you did not give up for this things, however this is a wrong way to thinking, the reason behind this is yes it is ture that if you are keep working and do not give up then you might be become a successful person but It's still depend on what kind of ways are you choice to go. Then you cna get more easily to successful.. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I can not say this is a wrong opinion, but I have a different opinion with Thomas Jefferson.

While other people might think that if you keep working hard, and there will be one day that you can get successful. But people will get lost when they working to hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they doing now, they will be worry about next time when they want to do something, they became afired to try.

So my suggest is people should be thinking before they want working hard, to make a plan or talk to someone and konw what they think. if you choice a wrong way to go then you get a big mistake, you have to start all over again, that's wasting time.

To understand the answer to this question, it is important to look at the meaning behind being oneself. Being oneself is more than just the physical attributes that make up a person’s identity. 
In a world of constant pressure to conform, it can be difficult to truly be oneself. It is about understanding who you are, and accepting it, even if that means going against the common norm. To be true to oneself in a world that is trying to change you is a major accomplishment.

It takes courage and conviction to stay true to oneself in the face of opposition. Doing so shows that not only have you accepted yourself, but that you are capable of standing up for something you believe in. Being able to stand up for one’s beliefs, no matter how unpopular they may be, is a key part of being oneself. It may give them the confidence to follow the path of self-acceptance and discovery.

At the end of the day, though being oneself in a world constantly trying to change the person you are can be a daunting task, it is a great accomplishment that should be celebrated. The greatest accomplishment in the world can be being yourself in a world that is attempting to change the person you are.. Our society is constantly trying to change us, to mold us into the people that it prefers. In addition, it can be educational and inspiring to those that may follow a similar path.

390358,"In the past two decades, the world has seen a dramatic shift in the way people get around. With the rise of ride sharing services, electric vehicles, and other green transportation options, it is becoming increasingly clear that the future of transportation is changing. As such, I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today.

One of the primary reasons for this shift is the rise of ride sharing services such as BER and Lyft. These services have made it easier and more affordable for people to get around without needing to own a car. As a result, more and more people are opting to use ride sharing services instead of buying their own vehicles. This trend is likely to continue in the coming years, resulting in fewer cars on the road.

Another factor that will contribute to the decline in car usage is the increasing availability of electric vehicles. Electric vehicles are becoming increasingly popular due to their environmental benefits and cost savings. As more and more people switch to electric vehicles, the number of cars on the road will decrease. Additionally, electric vehicles are often more efficient than traditional gas powered cars, meaning that fewer cars will be needed to transport the same number of people.

Finally, the rise of autonomous vehicles will also contribute to the decline in car usage. Autonomous vehicles are expected to be much safer than traditional cars, and they will also be able to drive more efficiently, meaning that fewer cars will be needed to transport the same number of people. Additionally, autonomous vehicles will be able to communicate with each other, allowing them to coordinate their movements and reduce traffic congestion.

In conclusion, I believe that in twenty years, there will be fewer cars in use than there are today. This is due to the rise of ride sharing services, electric vehicles, and autonomous vehicles, all of which are making it easier and more affordable for people to get around without needing to own a car. As a result, fewer cars will be needed to transport the same number of people, leading to a decrease in car usage.

I'm 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didn't know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you don't give up.

When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didn't know English. I didn't stop growing I kept growing to become better to play.

Why won't we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time.

He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team.

My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer.

I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didn't believe them. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond.

All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.     . But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they won't drop out of school. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well.

In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time.

Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that they'll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination.

Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesn't like video conferencing which can be very often. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home?

In this prompt

I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Knowing that student's can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. Student's would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job.

214905,"""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Hadron Walker, in ""carefree cities"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal. Currently, in the United States, 82 percent of people own a vehicle. Which means in the average city is a busy street, car horns honking, traffic contested place to live. Limiting car usage can be beneficial to you, your city, and your planet.

Limiting car usage can have great advantages on the Earth. Almost half of the greenhouse gas in the United States is from cars. Greenhouse gas has an effect on the North and South Poles that makes them melt faster causing the sea level to rise. So, if we were to lessen the use of cars we would be doing a great favor to the Earth. Many times on the news we hear about oil spills, and big or small, it hurts so many sea animals because it gets in their fur and when prey wants to eat those contaminated animals they die. Think of all the innocent animals that get hurt so that cars have gas to run on.

Living in a carefree city can benefit the whole community. Knowing all or your neighbors is pretty rare now because everyone is always on the go driving somewhere, or cooped up in their home. Walking or Biking to the store with your neighbors can be the new normal if car usage was limited. Vehicles will actually hurt your health in the long run, because cars put so much pollution in the air which will eventually make the air too toxic to breathe. In, ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert puffer, ""just one day with half of Paris not driving the smog cleared enough that they didn't have to ban driving the next day"". According to the U.S. motor vehicle accident website, every ten minutes somebody dies in the United States due to a car accident. Loved ones can be saved if car usage is limited.

Reducing the usage of cars will benefit your well-being. Priving a vehicle requires so much attention and focus, it is quite stressful. ""It is a good opportunity to take away stress and lower air pollution,"" said Carlos Arturo during Bogotá, Colombia's carefree day. People of Vauban, Germany (a city that gave up cars) are happier, they have more energy, and they even look younger. Gas is at an average price of two dollars and thirty cents, think of all the money that can be saved and put towards something else if you never had to pay for gas again! Limiting car usage will help you financially, physically, and mentally.

Overall, a city without cars has many advantages. People can see the people they love and the planet they love prosper without the usage of vehicles. According to, ""The end of car culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Bill Ford, executive chairman of the Ford Motor Company, proposed partnering with the telecommunications industry to create cities in which, 'pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety.'""

11697,"Dear state senator,

Hello my name is PROPER_NAME and I am writing to you about our voting system. Many individuals are not content with the Electoral College and many are. You could see both sides, but that does not mean we should switch to election by popular vote. Here are a few reasons on why the Electoral College method is the way to go.

During election by popular vote there is a great chance that there could be a ""tie"". A tie would cause a great set back in the voting process due to the fact that there would have to be more votes cast or even longer campaigns. In the Electoral College system we don't have to worry about things like that happening. Yes, disputes are possible, but they are very rare. As stated in article three under the headline certainty of outcome, the reason for very few disputes is that the wnning candidate's share of the Electoral College exceeds his share of the popular vote. It is highly unlikely for a tie to occur.

Article three line twenty-two reads "" The Electoral College avoids the problem of elections in which no candidate receives a majority of the votes cast."". One example of this is in 1968 Nixon only had a 43 percent plurality of the popular votes, but won the majority in the Electoral College. Another example is in 1992 when Clinton also only had 43 percent of popular vote but majority in the Electoral College. Source three line twenty-three states "" It can be argued that the Electoral College method of selecting the president may turn off potential voters for a candidate who has no hope of carrying their state.."". This is true but the Electoral College is still more efficient due to the fact there are rarely ever any ties.

The Electoral College eliminates the power of a large population, everything is equal. The winner-take-all method induces candidates to focus their campaign efforts on the toss-up states. Voters in the toss up states are likely to be te most thoughtful, the most thoughtful voters should be the ones to decide the election. The case in the popular vote method is very different.

Over all you can see that the Electoral College method is the way to go. There are les bumps in the road and it is very efficient. There are rarely any ties, everything is fair, and it avoids run-off elections. We should not switch to the popular vote method.",,0.0

Doing something in order to accomplish one's goals is infinitely better than doing nothing. Taking action, however small, gives us the opportunity to grow, learn, and become more capable of tackling more significant challenges. By strategizing, we can create a step-by-step plan designed to make our dreams a reality--stakes become more manageable and our options become clearer. 

Opportunities, both tangible and intangible, become available from taking some steps towards achieving our desired end goal. These opportunities serve to further our ambitions by exposing us to new knowledge and networks that couldn't be gained otherwise. By doing something, we put our best foot forward and showcase our level of commitment to those around us, possibly leading to new and exciting opportunities not available if we simply stayed still.

Ultimately, doing something also aids our decision-making process. We become clear on what we want and the steps needed to get there. Over analyzing different situations can be overwhelming and paralyzing, but by taking action we can move forward and gain momentum we can carry with us. All in all, doing something is far better than doing nothing, as it allows us to grow and capitalize on chances to further our ambitions and build a successful future.",,1.0

In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family.

The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.

I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didn't have time because of school. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks.

The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. .

308674,"I don't agree for these reasons:

First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they can't do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldn't do during the school year. In Summer they don't need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got.

Some persons may don't agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they don't got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest.

In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldn't do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things.

Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and when they return in the fall, they become more lazy and they can't retain information as easily when they were in school.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldn't do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too.

Finally, In Summer break the students don't worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they don't have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because it's not good to be always working, they got tired too",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Ultimately, the importance of being open and honest in relationships should be weighed against potential risks; if the rewards of honesty outweigh the drawbacks, then honesty may be the best choice.. 
Honesty is a valued trait that can carry many benefits and consequences, depending on the situation. Being honest with friends and family in particular is especially important, as trust and openness are essential components of these relationships.

When making important decisions, it is often essential to seek out the advice of the people who are closest to us. Ultimately, the combination of life experience and wisdom from trusted sources can be invaluable when making decisions.. 

In addition to family, friends are also an invaluable source of advice when making decisions. Seeking input from trusted advisors can help to confirm or adjust the direction of a decision, leading to a more informed choice. 

Therefore, it is clear that both life experience and guidance from friends and family are essential when making important decisions. These can range from friends and family to mentors and consultants. Although I had already made up my mind to do so, I still sought out the advice of my father, who had also served. We often build our closest circles of friends over many years, and they get to know us as well as we know ourselves. He knew the value of carefully weighing the pros and cons of any decision, even one as significant as mine. Life experience can be a great source of wisdom for important decisions, as it can provide insightful observations and a unique perspective that can help someone to see a problem from a different angle.

According to the article the founding fathers established it in the constitution as a comprise between election and President. Unfortunately, some American citizens think they vote directly for the president which is a false statement. The electoral college system is inaccurate, unfair, and is horribly balanced and designed.

Although the electoral college system is used in every presidential election the system is unfair to voters. For instance, according to Bradford Plume in the article ""Because of the winner-take-all system in each state candidates don't spend time in states they have no chance of winning, focusing only on the ""Swing States"". American citizens in states such as Rhode Island, and South Carolina are not getting the 'good side of the stick. 'Voters in small states sometimes don't get to see a single campaign ad' says Bradford. The electoral college is treating American citizens in small areas horribly.

A lot of times, citizens cannot control who there electors vote for. Not to mention the electors are also anonymous. According to source 2 voters sometimes get confused about electors and vote for the wrong candidate. There would be a lot better results if the citizens could trust electors with their votes.

39330,"Asking for advice when making life decisions is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. There are numerous benefits to seeking out the opinions of others, including cost effectiveness, having an outside perspective, and raising success rates. In contrast, not soliciting advice can lead to negative consequences, such as missed opportunities and poor decision-making.

One of the most significant advantages of seeking advice is cost effectiveness. By asking for the opinions of others, individuals can save money by avoiding costly mistakes. For example, if someone is considering starting a business, they may seek advice from experienced entrepreneurs to avoid common pitfalls and make informed decisions. Similarly, if someone is trying to make a major purchase, such as a car or home, seeking advice from friends or family members can help them make a more informed decision and potentially save money in the long run.

Another benefit of seeking advice is having an outside perspective. When making life decisions, it can be easy to become biased or tunnel-visioned. However, by seeking advice from others, individuals can gain a fresh perspective and potentially make more well-rounded decisions. For example, if someone is trying to decide on a career path, seeking advice from people in different fields can help them gain a better understanding of the pros and cons of various options.

Finally, seeking advice can raise success rates. By making informed decisions based on the opinions of others, individuals are more likely to succeed in their endeavors. For example, if someone is trying to start a business, seeking advice from experienced entrepreneurs can help them develop a solid business plan and increase their chances of success. Similarly, if someone is trying to improve their grades, seeking advice from a tutor or study group can help them develop better study habits and achieve better academic results.

On the other hand, not soliciting advice can lead to negative consequences. For example, if someone makes a decision without seeking advice, they may miss out on valuable insights and opportunities. Additionally, if someone is biased or tunnel-visioned, they may make poor decisions that could negatively impact their life. For example, if someone decides to invest all their money in one stock without seeking advice from a financial advisor, they may lose all their money if the stock performs poorly.

In conclusion, seeking advice when making life decisions is a crucial aspect of personal growth and development. It is cost effective, provides an outside perspective,",,1.0

If a person is not trustworthy than there is nothing they can do other than try not to lie. The difference between Joker and Batman is that Batman chose good traits while Joker turned himself evil by choosing bad traits. We make ourselves the person we become in the future. It is completely your decision if you want to add good traits in your personality or bad traits. A person can ruin their character by choosing bad traits. Our traits make our characters and personalities. Traits like honesty and being able to do what's right without any fear will make us proud of ourselves in the future. Bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. There is a huge difference between right or wrong. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves while bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone.               . There will be always two paths one will lead to good and other will lead to bad although our it depends on our own selves to choose from right or wrong,good or bad the choice is ours. Although some traits in a character of a person comes from experiences and most of the time bad traits comes from the worst experiences in our life. That's why it is extremely important to choose good traits for ourselves because it is good. Most of the problems in our lives can be solved by choosing good traits over evil. Most of times its the journey that matters the most than the destination because it not about how we choose to become a better person it is about the experiences that led us to who we will be in the future. Everyone has a right to choose what's best for themselves. Even though tragic experiences led Joker to be evil but his past didn't give him the right to be evil. If a person is not honest than they are not trustworthy. But it is completely our choice if we want to make those bad experiences a process of learning and learn something good from them. We write our stories by ourselves so it is all on in our hands what we want to be.

Although some people might disagree and yes it is true that our characters can formed by influences beyond our control but it depends on us what we want to be. ""Character is something what you yourself choose to make it""

I agree with John Lubbock because our character is something we make by ourselves. It is true that some traits are formed beyond our control but it depends on ourselves if we want those trait in our characters or not.

Some people get too comfortable with bad traits and they don't want to change their selves for example lying is a worst trait anyone can possibly have it leads to do things that we don't even want to do but we do it anyways because we get comfortable and have no fear. Some people make their life miserable by choosing what's worst for them like bad traits. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves. It is very important to choose good traits. The harder the path will be the stronger the person becomes so it depends on ourselves to choose good or bad. ""Lying is not better than silence"" so it is way better to not say anything than lie about it. It is important for ourselves to choose good rather that ruin our lives with choosing something like bad traits. Lying is not something to be proud of and bad experiences doesn't give anyone the right to lie because it doesn't matter. Everyone wants to be proud of themselves and to make that possible they need to adapt good traits. Some people choose worst traits but others choose good. It is about how some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences but others learn good things from them. Some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences that's how most of the people get their worst traits. In this world there is nothing more important than being who we are and choosing best for ourselves.

Our characters can formed by influences beyond our control for example something bad that happened in the past can lead a person to lie and being dishonest. If you want to be proud of yourself then it is a must to choose good traits. Difficult situations make a person stronger and traits like honesty will make us proud of ourselves in future. Lying is something that leads to other bad traits like dishonesty. The decision is ours and what we want to be ourselves to be like it totally depends on us. Even though sometimes being honest and speaking truth can lead to difficult situations and most people don't want to deal with difficult situations which is okay but it is important to do something right. Trust is like a glass if it breaks it will never be the same. Everyone knows the difference between right or wrong. It is true to say that we become what we want to be and we choose our traits by ourselves. If we want to be become something we'll be proud of or something we will be ashamed of. We choose our traits and characters by ourselves. So,you can't be evil because of your past and becoming a better person or having good traits will lead to a better future because it past is past and future is something to look forward to. It is not wrong to say that people choose what they want to be and how they want their life. There will be consequences of choosing bad and sometimes it will be easy to not be brave and choose the worst traits for ourselves. We choose our traits and what we want our characters to be like by ourselves we should know what's good and bad for ourselves. All these problems are caused by lying and it depends on our to choose if we want to lie and make ours characters full of worst traits or be a better person choose good traits.

It should also be made clear that teachers and school administration will be monitoring smartphone use in the classroom, and that the students should understand the consequences of not abiding by the rules. In addition, having a smartphone in the classroom can be a major source of peer social comparison and rivalry, leading to a disruption of the learning environment. With the capability of providing non-stop access to the Internet, smartphones can be used to access emails, videos, games, and even social media platforms, which can result in students becoming easily diverted from learning. 

By thoughtfully discussing and communicating the importance of not using smartphones in classrooms with parents and students, we can create an environment where learning is the main priority and the use of technology in the classroom is seen as an educational tool, rather than as a source of distraction. When a student is using a phone, there should be clear rules for being respectful of classmates, not engaging with inappropriate content, and not overusing the phone during class time. 

Parents should be aware of the risks associated with the use of smartphones in the classroom. 
Smartphones can be a major distraction in the classroom. It is important to have open dialogue with parents about the role of smartphones in the classroom and the potential dangers of being too addicted or immersed in technology. Educators should emphasize that smartphones can be a positive tool when used responsibly, such as for researching specific topics and connecting with other students, but that their use can become a distraction if not monitored properly.

Getting more opinion can also help you have more choices to choose from. But that didn't enough for your essay. You try to asked one of your friend, but still don't have an answer for it. You can use it however you want. You can combine those opinion together to make it a better idea. But, sometime people don't always choose the better one for you. Next time, try to ask or talk to more people. Then, you ask your dad and your sister. You ask your mom to give you her opinion. People's opinion will help you make a good decision.

Getting opinion will always helpful for you, if you know how to use it correctly.

Listen to people's opinion and then make your own decision. But you don't have to always follow people's opinion. So, you have to decide which option you want to take. You can make your own decision.

But, asking for opinion from people around you will help you a lot. Now, you have three opinion from different people. You will decide you want to ""spend"" it or keep it for another time, like you are holding your own little world.

535315,"We can accept life on our own terms, and be content with who we are and where we are going. By staying true to ourselves, we can accomplish great things.. Being true to ourselves also opens us up to understanding life in a different way, because nature is beautiful and ever-changing. We hone our individual skills and abilities, and discover our true passions. However, being true to ourselves and our own interests allows us to embark on wondrous journeys that others might not embark upon. For example, if we ignored the pressures of society to conform, we might choose to visit awe-inspiring places like a lush green forest, a secluded mountain valley, or a magnificent waterfall. It can show us how fragile and fleeting our lives can be, but also how lasting and purposeful that life can be if we are ourselves.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was well-known for stating that “to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment”. 
In a world that constantly tells us to change who we are in order to fit in, it can be easy to forget what makes us unique and individual. I could not agree more with this statement. When we stay true to ourselves and dismiss the external pressures of society, we are able to find and explore new parts of ourselves we never thought possible",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In contrast, the consequences of “not doing work always” can have negative effects on individuals and society. He led a remarkable life full of impressive accomplishments that exemplify the principle of “doing work always”. Similarly, hard work has played an important role in inspiring the success of countless individuals, from 19th century poet Walt Whitman to modern-day entrepreneur Steve Jobs, revealing the power of “doing work always”. The founding of the University of Virginia, for example, was a testament to the less popular slogan, “never tire of doing work”. On the society level, it can lead to lack of innovation and progress, which can be especially problematic in a rapidly-evolving world. Throughout Jefferson’s lifetime, the hardworking people around him believed that “working hard” was the surest path to achieving success. 

This idea of “doing work always” has benefitted many people throughout history, from famous politicians to humble citizens. I have experienced countless successes, all highlighting the power of “doing work always” and the amazing things that can be accomplished through hard work and dedication.. It has been the cornerstone of my education and career, continually pushing me to reach higher and try harder.

    The debate over year-round school has been especially contentious in recent years. Schools could also look into reapportioning the longer December-March break or shifting towards a four-day school week. 

Nevertheless, critics of year-round school contend that it results in teachers having greater workloads, since they are required to teach for more weeks each year. Other drawbacks include increased energy costs for schools that need to remain in operation during the summer months and decreased recreational opportunities for students who are occupied with school instead of enjoying summer activities with their classmates. Summer break allows students the opportunity to engage in activities that help them relax and view learning in a different light—which in turn can make learning more enjoyable.. Lastly, summer break offers students the opportunity to attain further academic progress and even available internships, as well as the chance to relax. Supporters of year-round school argue that it provides students with more flexible scheduling, allowing them to take classes during regular summer months instead of having an extended December-March break. Additionally, they suggest that a continuous educational cycle supports learning and decreases the amount of time devoted to reviewing earlier material upon returning to school.

Finally, distance learning gives students with disabilities more autonomy and independence. It allows these students to access educational opportunities without having to navigate the many obstacles they often face in a physical classroom setting. With online teachers readily available to offer help and assistance when needed, students can tailor their learning experience to their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead, they can learn on their own time, on their own terms, reducing feelings of helplessness and frustration. Through distance learning, these students can access educational materials on their own time, when and where it is most convenient for them to do so. 

The benefits of distance learning for students with disabilities are numerous and include increased access to educational materials, personalized instruction, and a greater sense of independence. 

In addition, distance learning programs provide personalized instruction suited to each student's individual needs. They no longer need to worry about transporting themselves to traditional school, dealing with the possibility of bullying or discrimination, or keeping up with a strict school schedule. With greater access, personalization, and autonomy, these students can gain the education and confidence they need to flourish.. 
Distance learning has been an attractive option for many students who have disabilities or who don't enjoy traditional school. Firstly, students with disabilities are often subject to limited accessibility issues in traditional school, such as limited access to materials or physical spaces. This can provide a sense of control for students with disabilities, allowing them to learn at their own pace and in a way that works best for them.

The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it""

I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school.

It is clear that failure and success exist in equal balance, and it is important to recognize that failure is not the end. Through gaining a better understanding of failure, it is possible to develop the skills necessary to reach success.

Consequences of failing must be taken into consideration however, as they can be detrimental to success. For instance, negative consequences of failure could include a lack of confidence, a fear of trying again, or discouragement from reaching goals. As former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said, “Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This statement emphasizes the importance of perseverance and enthusiasm despite all setbacks. By understanding failure and how it can lead to success, it is possible to remain enthusiastic and continue striving towards success.. Furthermore, failure often leads to a greater appreciation for success when it is achieved. Through failure, we can find out what works and develop a plan for effective action.

30299,"Dear Principal Smith, 

I am writing to express my views on the possible policy change of requiring students to have at least a B average in order to participate in sports and other extracurricular activities. While maintaining good grades is important, I do not think imposing this restriction is the best approach. 

Requiring a B average may discourage students who are working hard but still getting C grades. For some students, being part of a team or club helps motivate them to focus on their studies. Taking this away could actually have the reverse effect of causing grades to slip even further. Extracurricular activities provide an outlet and help teach important skills like time management, commitment and responsibility. Banning students who work hard but get average grades punishes their efforts and takes away a valuable learning experience.

A policy like this may also disproportionately impact students from lower-income families or those facing personal challenges outside of school. Not all students have the same support systems or study environments at home. If efforts to improve grades are not succeeding despite their best efforts, extracurriculars may be the only positive aspect of their school experience left. Removing that could seriously hurt their well-being and desire to continue striving in their classes. 

Instead of an outright ban, consider alternative approaches that still encourage academic achievement without being overly punitive. For example, students with C averages could remain eligible but be required to attend study sessions or work with tutors. This offers support to help them boost their performance over time rather than blocking opportunities. Maintaining involvement in activities could then act as an incentive to meet the study requirements.

In closing, while maintaining a focus on academics is important, I do not believe excluding average students from sports and clubs is the fairest or most effective way to accomplish this goal. A collaborative, supportive approach would better serve the needs and potential of all students. I hope you will reconsider implementing this proposed policy change.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

While we have many sports teams at our school available to students, a policy change is urgently needed to make sure that everyone has a chance to join. I strongly believe this would be beneficial to our students and our school.. Increasing opportunities for students in this way can contribute to an overall more positive school climate where everyone can feel included. 
As the principal of our school, I'm sure you want to give students the best opportunities to build a positive environment both physically and mentally. 

A change in policy would also support the inclusion of students from backgrounds who may have never considered participating in sports. 

Updating the policy to allow students a chance to join no matter what their skill level is, would open up a larger range of students to join teams. 

With so many potential benefits for the whole school, I respectfully request that policy changes be made to provide students the chance to join sports teams regardless of their experience level. 

Currently, the criteria for joining teams is restricted to highly experienced students who often have had the chance to receive extra and expensive after-school training to become proficient in the sport. This puts many students at a disadvantage as they cannot participate on the team if they cannot meet the physical and technical requirements. Additionally, students who join teams often have improved mental health, better relationships with peers, and increased motivation in academic studies",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Conspiracy theorist were fast to make speculations that this was ancient alien architecture or something of the sort. BFT NASA said that the face was just a geographical coincidence, and there is no alien structure on Mars.

One reason that conspiracy theorist could believe that this could be an alien structure is that the resolution of the first picture was very low. In paragraph 10 it sasses,"" ...43 meters per pixel in the best 1976 Viking photo."" This shows that the photo didn't give very compelling evidence that there was life on Mars. Soon later NASA and their supporters claimed that this face is just an act of nature is because of the 1998 Global Surveyor spacecraft. This new spaceship passed over the red planet to take pictures of the ""face on Mars"". The pictures were ten times better than the last pictures of Estonia this time. The new photos clearly showed a landform on Mars and not a man.

BFT even after these new pictures conspiracy theorist were still bent on the idea that NASA was trying to cover something FP. In spite of the new pictures people said that the was the photo was taken, it was clouds. Therefor the photos couldn't be very accurate. In fact, these theorists were right. The was the photo was taken was in winter. It sasses in paragraph 8 that,"" ... it was winter in April '98 a clouds time of sear on the Red Planet."" These facts show that the landmass could indeed be hidden BS clouds. However, NASA still supported their claim that it was just a misinterpreted natural landform.

While NASA never spoke negatively about the theory, the set oft again to prove it wrong. On April 8, 2001, the Mars Global Surveyor came over the face on Mars, and it took photos with a resolution of 1.56 meters per pixel; the highest ever set. What these pictures showed was what would be a Bette or a mesa on Earth. These landforms are very common in Estonia, so the pictures were very realistic. With very high resolution photos, it is hard for conspiracy theorists to still SAS that there is face on Mars. It even sasses in paragraph 11,"" So if there were objects in this picture like airplanes on the ground or Egsptianstsle pyramids or even small shacks, of could see what the were!""

In conclusion, the face on Mars is supported and not supported. NASA has proven with photographic evidence that it is just a natural France while conspiracy theorists SAS that it is a martian civilization. I think that NASA's facts are very believable, and the shave the science to back FP their claim. I hope that in the future, more people will base their beliefs off of science and not fictional conspiracy theories. ",,0.0

Currently, there is a policy in place to restrict the use of cell phones during school hours. If students are seen using cell phones for any other activity, they should be subject to disciplinary action. 

Second, students should be allowed to use their phones for educational purposes only, such as using online dictionaries and conducting research. As a result, it is proposed that the current policy on cell phone use in the school be revised to provide a more balanced approach for both teachers and students. While this policy is intended to ensure teachers and students can focus on their learning, it has proven to be somewhat ineffective. For instance, teachers should check for phones during examinations and, if applicable, confiscate them from students who use them inappropriately. Lastly, the school should provide information to both teachers and students regarding the revised policy, so everyone is aware of what is expected of them

By introducing these changes, the current policy on cell phone use in the school can be revised to make it fair and effective for both teachers and students.. 

Finally, stricter enforcement of the policy should be in place. This will allow them to stay connected to the outside world and provide an easy means of communication if necessary.

In order to make failure a positive experience, it’s important to stay motivated. 

To summarize, failure is not the end of the world - it's just a roadblock that we must overcome in order to find success. Staying positive and understanding that the process of success is full of highs and lows is key to overcoming failure and finding success. It pushes us to stay positive, motivated, and determined, and to keep striving for the best. We should learn from mistakes and view failure as an opportunity to learn and grow. It pushes us to reflect on our mistakes and strive to make better decisions in the future. It is normal to feel discouraged, but it is important to remember that setbacks are just temporary. Staying motivated, being positive, and learning from our mistakes are all important aspects of recovering from failure. Failure can open up new opportunities to find success, build resilience, and gain valuable life lessons. Accepting our failures, rather than dwelling on them, is key to success. It can be seen as both good and bad, but mainly depends on one's attitude towards it. By viewing failure in this way, we can transform it from something that is bad into something that can ultimately lead to success.. Understanding that failure is part of the process can help us stay motivated and keep us from getting discouraged.

Finally, it is important to practice self-care when facing failure. To quote Winston Churchill, ""Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."" 

Failure can help us become better people. It encourages us to think about the cause of failure and how to overcome it and become more successful.

On the other hand, however, it is important to recognize that being independent does not always equate with being correct. Similarly, when making decisions about which products or services to purchase, taking into account personal preference and value-based judgments can often lead to better decisions than relying on expert advice. Being able to think independently and look at the unique aspects of a situation is increasingly becoming the best way to make decisions. 
Recent events in our society have highlighted the importance of trusting our own judgment rather than relying solely on the advice of so-called ""experts"". Ultimately, learning to trust our own judgement is a valuable life skill, but it should never be done without the appropriate caution.. This is never more evident than in the realm of self-actualization, where the individual is unique and is often best-suited to make decisions on their own behalf. Failing to do so can lead to disastrous results, sometimes even worse than blindly following expert advice. Making autonomous decisions should always involve considering the potential negative outcomes. Therefore, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of any decision made before going ahead. Relying on generic career advice from an ""expert"" can lead to outcomes that do not best reflect the individual's interests and potential.

Through programs that pair older and younger students, the older students also benefit from learning about different approaches to problem-solving and finding new methods of teaching. By proactively creating these connections between different age groups, students will benefit from integrated learning opportunities and develop strong relationships with their peers. This gives the program an academically valuable purpose which allows the students to exchange information and ideas from different ages, enhancing their education and understanding of the world.

When implemented in schools, programs that pair older and younger students can help promote understanding between generations, while also providing students with valuable skills. These programs help foster relationships between students of different ages, and provide opportunities for them to help one another. 

Programs that pair older and younger students have become essential to bridging the generational gap between them.

However, there are two distinct approaches to mobile phone policies in a school setting; namely, a strict-ban policy, and a moderate-use policy. 

The strict-ban policy eliminates the presence of mobile phones in the school by prohibiting their use entirely. 

On the other hand, the moderate-use policy allows for student use of mobile phones in a restricted and supervised manner. For example, a student might be allowed to use their phone during free-time in their break or recess period. Additionally, students without mobile phones may be less prone to cyberbullying or unwanted contact from external sources, creating a safe and secure learning environment for everyone. Adopting such a policy can reduce potential distractions that might occur during class time, including microphones being turned on or the use of social media during lessons. As such, many schools have implemented policies aimed at managing mobile phone use among their student body. 
Mobile phones have become essential tools for students in the modern era, providing a constant connection to others as well as access to information. A moderate-use policy also allows for the use of mobile devices for educational purposes, such as for researching or downloading educational resources, which can have positive outcomes in terms of learning outcomes.

In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.

First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. That's why I think elective classes was important.

secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. High school year is the most important year in students life. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.

Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.

Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of.

Another reason is, It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" However, it is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people.

807840,"If High-schools don't take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isn't right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives.

Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress.

There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier aren't intrested. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared.

Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. . After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. I know that having career coarses is a great idea for students to identify their careers in High-school. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society.

We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students,

We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study. College professors won't have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for test's and final exams.

Having career coarses in High-school will cost a lot of money, but why not spend it if are main focus is to educate the students and help them suceed in the future",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
379931,"         . The parents of this excellent students, and good person, so they feeling fortunate for have a big son.

All we have the opportunity for to be a best person in the life, all depended how we wants to be in the life. This student continue that, He pass all the classes, and SOL that He need for graduated. The thing are best when we support all bad thing.

The best idea is continue with the school and be a good students, because all student that it is educated, they type students have a more opportunity that other who they don't want to be a best person in the future.

Why the younger people just thinking in pass the life in party or in the street?

Why now in day we see a kids abandoned in the street?

Because many mother don't have a good education for to have a compromise of the had a kids, this type of mother just thinking in that the drugs,alcohol,or party is the major thing.

Many mother having a bad decisions!

So is for that what we need to prepare for to make more easy our life.

Have a diploma of the High School is very important because we work less, and we have a good job,when we have a good job we have a lot money, and when this happened we are prepare for take a funny moment in our life, But just for that is not the base for make whatever thing, first we need think what we need to do!

We know that this life is so hurt, and is more hurt when we take a bad decision like not finish the school or don't put care to our thing for to be prospered.

Some time is good help take course when the people don't finish the school.

Example:

take a course for by the license, and put a beauty salon.

take a course for by idea how to have a company of electricity.

take a course for be some body also a little important in the life.

take a course for be a teacher of music.

We have so much course for prepare more when we don't finish the school.

Some time when a students go to the school, and they not finish is responsibility of the parent guardian because the parent need to see for the son or daughter keep going the school, I think when the students don't finish the school part of this is fault of the parents.

How we can finished the school, and how can I do graduated?

The things for to finished the school is:

Go to the school every day.

Make the homework.

Prepared for the quiz or test.

Pass all the SOL.

Pass all the classes.

When you make all the work in the classes or in the school, and you pass all the thing, you can graduated. when a student is smart make the time important for take other course for to have for credit is for that some student don't need to take the four grade in the high school, A student also that have excellent grade in all the classes, and only have a difficult classes, this student that had the opportunity for graduated early that other students.

Example:

A student of Generic_School is in 9 grade, but this student have a difficult classes, but this students is focus just in the classes, and have a excellent grade also this student take a deport after school all the days. During the summer He go to the summer school for to pass other class that he going to have in 10 grade, finish the summer school He pass the class with excellent grade, so this student had a so much credit of the normal.

He stars the 10 grade, so He had other advanced classes, because in summer school he pass the classes that He was going to have in 10 grade. The student he's prepared every time for the quiz, and for test.

Finish the school the student is the best student of the year in the school because He passed all the classes and the SOL. Many student wants to have a excellent grade but don't put of they part for be a good students.

Now in day the most students just want to come to school for 3 or 4 classes but don't want study for had a good grade,many students go to school but don't go the classes, and other students is stay outside of school for smoky, because the most students used cigarette or other thing.

We don't know appreciated the best opportunity of the life.

Reasons for graduated in three year

All students who graduated early have a big opportunity in the collage, and the university, and the work or whatever place.

why?

because the old person thinking that this type of person are responsible in all the thing.

Are a people responsible!

Why?

because when have a big responsibility never said 'NO' and have care for all thing.

Example:

I'm Generic_Name, I work in Bank Of America, today my boss need to leave early because He had a compromised with other important person, and He give me the responsibility for received the money of today.

Be carefully!

Why?

because they try to make with carefully the work or whatever thing.

Example:

My name is Generic_Name, and I work a company of cake, and my supervisor said me congratulation because you are very carefully with the work all the time.

My Idea!

I think all the people we have the best opportunity in the life to be a best person in the live,but the major opportunity is that when we have somebody is protected, and supported our decisions.

When we start the education needed to keep the marge for be the person who we want to be. Now this students is in 11 grade, but the student had a big credit and He go to the school for 4 classes so this student have the opportunity for graduated in 11 grade because is a excellent student.

He finally is graduated the school in 11 grade, so He finish the school, but He said that want to go the collage because want to prepare more for to go to the university, because He want to be a excellent lawyer.

The excellent student finish the collage, and the university, so now He is a big lawyer with a great statutes. If you not want to go to the collage, the diploma of the High School is very important for have a good job in your life. Students graduated in three year of the High School!

I think is good idea because all student that want a best future try to do a good thing that it is a benefit for the school",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

It IL because of the corrupt problem of the Electoral College that he did not gain presidency. It IL this among other things we must do away with the Electoral College if we want to run a true democracy.

There are many people who would argue that the Electoral College Should Lay and be a part of how we elect our president. Richard A. Polder author of

Defense of the Electoral College claims the candidate for president must have a transitional appeal (Source 3 paragraph 18). This however IL not true. According to a map that Howl the breakdown of the number of electoral vote Leach State get he/The could very well just get the vote from two region and win the election. Yes you could Lay that two region are transitional but this idea IL baled on collection of Later from each region. Not one or two. Ponder all Albert that, ""...the molt thoughtful voters Should be the one to decide the election""(paragraph 20). Here he IL Laying that only the Swinging StateLLuch AL Ohio Hawaii would determine who the president IL for the whole country. How IL letting a handful of people decide who the precedent will be a representation of the country AL a whole? Short answer, ITL not. It would be foolish to put the choice for president into the hand of few, ITL like putting all our eggs into one ballet and then throwing it off a roof.

There are a numeral amount of things that are not good about the electoral college. Bradford Plume from the foundation for National Progress and author of

Mother of Jones Lay that if there was to be a tie everything would be up to the House of RepreLentitveL(Source two paragraph 12). That mean Leach State get Lone vote. One! The representative from Wyoming who have 500,000 voterLwould have the Lame amount of power AL the representative from California who Hal 35 million voters. This IL in no way to run a country with fifty people representing about 250 million people. Plume all Later that the voters can't always pick who their electoral are (paragraph 10). While the electoral cannot be Someone in office, who IL to Lay that they may Lay one thing about whom they will vote for but in fact they vote for Someone eel? It Hal happened before. Every one Should get one vote and that be that none of this winner take all Tough.

Finally, we get to the part about the District of Columbia or Washington D.C. The Office of the Federal Register wrote an article on the Electoral College and it Lay that D.C. IL given three electoral and treated like a State(Source 1 paragraph 4). In one way this could be a good thing but in this called it IL a bad thing. The District of Columbia IL not a State and hold many government official. In fact many people don't live in D.C. they live in one of the neighboring Later. So why are we letting them have AL much of a Lay AL Vermont or Alaska or even one of the Dakota?

To wrap this all up the corrupt System in which we elect a group of people to do what we want IL not a very effective way to run a country in Stage four of the Demographic Transitional Stage. Although president George W. Bulk was an adequate president there IL Still unfair that Al more had not become our president when he hats the popular vote.",,0.0

Graduate early can make your life difficult because anxiety combine with pressure frequently gives mental problems. In case they need help from their teachers and schools they can get support from both. on account of doing four years of high school you dont need to do extra work. School districts should let the students decide whether they want to graduate early or not and give them more freedom to do want they want about their future. teachers recommend to the students to take extra courses during the summer or evenings to advanced in their classes. Every person should be responsible for their own work even if they have to do it later on it doesn't matter.

The school provides the students the opportunity to take a new subject that they haven't took before. Most high school students prefer to do their regular four years of high school and enter college after they graduate and apply for college during their senior year to get help from their counselors and school teachers. Some parents are constantly checking grades and that can be very frustrated towards their kids and hard to handle because they are often being told to do well and if they don't their guardians limit important items from them and usually control their life because they don't get good grades.

The fear to be behind and getting low grades are always present in students but the worries should be less for those that do not graduate early. Anxiety and pressure are serious problems that any student have to pass through because it distract them from their learning and the attention of the students is also taken away. by given them the chance to every student to choose elective courses unfortunately for those that graduate early don't have the same option because it is a waste of time receiving a class you don't need; otherwise you can take take as many as you want to challenge yourself and become better at any new topic you want to learn.

In conclusion it is a better idea if students do their traditional four years of high school. If you want to graduate early this issue can be dangerous because it can bring anxiety and pressure to adolescents during their high school years. Graduate early could be difficult for adolescents because not everyone have the same way of learning and some can be more faster than others. students that do their traditional four years do not follow this plan because it can bring pressure and anxiety, they would have to do extra work and,

they are able to pick elective classes.

Every student know that it is very important to pass their classes and be aware of how many credits they have in order to graduate. Extra time should not be used to do extra work because the kids need have to do their assignments and barely have time to do extra courses.

Everyone should have elective classes because is a good way to learn new activities in school and get distracted from your most important classes that you are taking during the school year",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
9322,"For other reason's it's better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. In conclusion i think it's a good idea that the school can give the benefit for student's to take online classes so they can get the help they need. Yes, I do believe that student's would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. I would think that some student's would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. If it wasn't for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldn't be passing anything or getting the help we need. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimes's parent's dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they don't get the help they need. Student's should be grateful that some school's are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           . The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. For example, if a student goes to the school and tell's them hey i'm having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher who's helping them. For some student's it's easy for them but for some it isn't easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. I'm pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. For example if a parent see's his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

I can be myself in a world when it is constantly trying to make me something seeing things like a place to see nature. And also I would see a beautiful area with flower bushes.

I agree with Emerson's statement about individuality. I'm thinking that the world is trying to make me who I am and make me see. Going into the forest usually it is just trees, but when I see something new in the forest, it would be very interesting. I could visit wonderful places like seeing great nature, going into a big forest, and go see big hills. I would see in the forest that the life is changing. the way I am can make me do whatever I want to do.

Seeing nature like seeing different kinds flowers, and seeing and beautiful. Sometimes in some places to see nature is amazing. Hills would be better for me because I just only want to see a high view of the land, with the mountains it is too cold and windy. When I see big hills usually it is just grass.

449695," In today's fast paced would, the idea of committing to a came em at a young age may seem daunting to some, but I believe it is a wise decision for students. As technology continues to play an increasingly important mole in out lives, the choices we make early on can have a significant impact on out future.

One of the main seasons I believe it is important for students to commit to a came em early on is that it allows them to take advantage of the resources and programs available to them. For example, high schools often offer guidance counseling and came em services to help students explore that options and make informed decisions about that future. By committing to a came em early on, students can take advantage of these resources and begin to plan that education and came em path accordingly.

Additionally, committing to a came em early on can also help students to focus that efforts and avoid the stress of making major decisions later in life. With so many options available to them, it can be overwhelming for students to decide on a came em path. By making a decision early on, students can focus that efforts on achieving that goals and avoid the stress of constantly second guessing that choices.

Of course, some may argue that it is too early for students to commit to a came em, and that they should be encouraged to explore that options and keep an open mind. While I understand this perspective, I believe that it is ultimately up to the individual student to decide what is best for them. For some students, the idea of committing to a came em early on may be appealing, while for others, it may not be the might choose.

In conclusion, while the idea of committing to a came em at a young age may seem daunting to some, I believe it is a wise decision for students. By taking advantage of the resources and programs available to them and focusing that efforts on achieving that goals, students can set themselves up for success and avoid the stress of making major decisions later in life.",,1.0
513153,"Technology have the limitation of human contract is due to use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples's lives. In some times is a lot of cases where the old people treated of fraud the children between the technology,like the socials media or online games they use to communicate in a bad way .In this case a lot of people death,in other are to use the technology on a bad way is when people want to be a hacker and they don't care to who they go to steal their accounts, in most of the case they steal banks accounts and use a lot of technology for that . that make me thing that if we had more opportunities to use the technology not all people think on good ways to use.

Technology can change the way of people live and think. Also,if you are in a relationship with someone you can't communicate with him or her only for text you need to talk with your partner for had a good contact each other. the limitation of the communications it is okay if you don see the person for talk. They had a lot of technology devices,they use that for help people,the most part are for do operations that help them to safe more life than the pass times they now trust more on the technology that the books. However if you see the things for other way like when you are in the schools you need to found a answer and you do trust on that you classmate said you can discuss with other people by technology or search for that. However technology is use a lot on fabrics and that make that the people don't work hard like on fabrics that need to packed the technology is the that make more the work than the people.

Humans can use technology to do good or bad things. Some times they use to sequester people or to rob other peoples bank accounts. the technology change the form of think of the old people because their in the pass time they need to write letters but now they can send a text or do a video call they dont need to be face to face . sometimes humans prefer technology more than books for search something because that are Lacy and don't want to read and the technology no always give to us good answers. Also,on the schools teachers and students need to use the technology,most of the time the students do their works on computers and they need to turned in by way of

Internet and if they had a question about something they can found on internet,on the schools is very important the technology they use for many things,on the schools of united states students and teachers use to do their works like 50% of technology they use more the technology for found information and they don't use a lot of books .In other way one part of the most people that use the technology is the doctors. i think that the technology can be affect in a positive way .For that a have some examples:

Technology is used for many things on humans life that make that the technology had a positive effect. For example, when you are in your work you need to have communication with your companion of work because you need to had a good relation with him. for example. If the technology did not exist we cant had more opportunities for learned more things for our life. on the conclusion for all my examples i think that no matter what if we had or not had human contact because both had positives an negatives effects. On one part the technology can do that the people feel safety of how their live in a good way on their house because the technology is more advanced and their create many things for people can be safe. technology make all more easy than can be. But in limitation i think we need to had more human communication that technology communication.. Humans use the technology for some different's things,on this times technology is almost everywhere. and if you are with your friends on one online game you need to had communication with him and you can talk face to face because he live in the other part of the world you can talk between the technology that make that the technology had a positive effect on the limitation.

Conclusion, some times the limitation of the human contact had a negative effect. For example,for some people the technology is their work they don't need to ask to nobody if they had a question about something ,if they did not had technology they can work and they can had money for live. Also,the people don't need to see face to face for had a conversation, because the technology are very advance that if you only cant had a phone you can communicate for text with people in other continents or countries. For example,with the time the people begin to learned little by little on how can they use the technology. Also, the technology make that the people that like to express on public can had a work in the social medias and show the their like to do like the youtubers they dont know who are washing then but they always talk like their know who see. The most part of people use the technology to do good things,like for their works like secretaries,teachers,doctors,and another works that use technology to communicate or safe things .Other people use the technology for teach to the children,in the Latin countries some parents begin to call the technology the new babysitter, for the reason that the technology like the phone, tablets , etc and more things like them are one of the ways more easy for distracting the children when their moms need to do or make somethings they use the technology and they don't need to other persons be with your children for distracting .Other people don't had good things on how can they use the technology and they learned how use however they use to defraud or search people on their social media they communicate a lot with the people",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Depending on the severity of the offense, legal penalties can range from fines to jail time. 
The potential consequences of disobeying curfew for teenagers can be severe depending on the city or state where the curfew is being enforced. For those who live in a city or state that does not have a statutory curfew, breaking curfew can still result in consequences from the parents such as restricted access to cars and phones, fewer privileges, or grounding. If the curfew is established by law, then it is punishable by law",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Soccer is one example about success soccer you got to learn a lot of new stuffs, Because you have to do a lot of practice. never lose your your enthusiasm because thats your key to success.. To win you gotta do something,and do it right all time. That to get where you what you got to fight. then I think about going back to collage and think of all the work that they do and all that im not going to keep going. for example there is a lot of people that have the motivation, then they start winning and fail ones and they give up. so you can become better everyday. Success Consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. And just think positive that you are gone be sussefull. Why because I stared to get more stuffs, and I wont feel success

Thats why i agree with what The britishs prime minister Winston Churchill said. Because I lost the enthusiasm that i had. There is a lot of stuffs that I been done on my life, that now i start thinking i never finish what I start. Lets said that i m trying to go to collage and I stared to work and stared to get a lot of money and all that.

Enthusiasm thats whats the way to success on your dreams if never use that enthusiasm to do something you are going to be good at it you might fail more than ones but still think about what is going to give you. But I dont give up i know I m going to end up doing them soon. when you love something you gotta chases it because then you are never going have it.

In my opinion i think technology has positive effect in people's live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school.

Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you dont need to be face to face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who dont have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans cant do.

However technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console , they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it to much but its not the fault of technology its our own responsibility to take care of our health.

First off, you will find that there is always something to do on board the ship, I found that there are many things to do so you can pass time. I played baseball and volleyball games in the empty holds where animals had been housed on return trips after the animals were unloaded. Table-tennis tournaments, fencing, boxing, reading, whittling, and games were some of the activities that we did.

Also, when you are off the ship and you need something to do, you can explore the surrounding area. On my trips, I toured an excavated castle, saw the Acopolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China. There are many things to see and do anywhere you are.

Lasty, you always know that the things that you do help many people in many ways. I always loved seeing the smiling faces of the people that I gave my time and energy into helping them. The people that we helped were survivors of World War II. Their belongings were destroyed, and most of their countries were left in ruins. We gave them food supplies, animals, and more.

For example if Generic_Name has soccer practice anymore. I disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring.

One reason the school board shouldnt add one and a half more hours is because there will be no time for after school activities. Another reason there shouldnt be one hour and a half is that everyone has their schedules like for example shower,homework,eat,sleep and they wont have time to do all of their schedule

This is why i disagree with my school adding one and a half more hours for these reasons there is no time for after school activities, going to have to give the teachers more, and your going to have to face a lot of students sleeping in class because lets admit it school is kind of boring..

The last example is that the bell schedule will be different and the people who work are going to do a lot of work to schedule lunch and everything.

Another reason i disagree with my school adding one hour and a half more time is that the teachers are going to have to face a lot of tied and sleeping students.

417874,"Dear Principal Smith,

I am writing to you regarding the school's cell Phone Policy and to express my view that Policy 1, which allows limited cell Phone use during free Periods, is the better option to consider moving forward. 

While there are valid reasons why cell Phones could be distracting during class time, an outright ban may be excessive and unrealistic. Many students rely on their Phones outside of school hours to stay in touch with family for safety reasons. Additionally, Phone cameras have become useful educational tools when used appropriately. Under Policy 1, students can still use their Phones for important communications during lunch or in between classes without disrupting learning. 

Some structure around cell Phone use is understandable to minimize distractions. But Policy 1's limited hours of Permissibility strike a fair balance that respects modern realities while still Prioritizing academics during lessons. Students will be less likely to feel the need to secretly use Phones or break rules if the Policy is seen as reasonable. This could held foster a better learning environment overall compared to a strict ban that may be difficult to enforce consistently.

In conclusion, Policy 1 allowing restricted Phone access aligns well with students' needs and maintains your focus on education. Most students will respect reasonable limits if given some flexibility and trust. I encourage you to trial this Policy to held students stay connected while still engaging fully with their studies during class. Please let me know if you need any other considerations in making your decision.

Thank you for your time and dedication to our school community.

Everyone has a talent or a skill, if not, they can find one eventually. My Talent

A talent or skill is something that is unique about everyone. . Many people these days are stuck in there electronics and never notice the world outside of them. It takes time to develop a talent or a skill. If you try everything, you'll eventually find something you are good at. Sometimes the activities you are interested in and are good at doing, might not be your talent, because skills and talents can just be hard to find. Simply by making a checklist, you can find many interests. Most researches say, a talent is something you are interested in doing. Even though there are a lot of steps for making a checklist, you'll will find a talent or skill soon.

The third way to develop a talent is to go outside. A talent or a skill is something that is unique and plays a good role of describing who you are. Around the world, many people have more than one talent. If you go outside, you will learn and experiences many things you didn't know. Sometimes by trying everything, you might not be able to find your talent, but you can always look at it another way. Soon, those activities might become a talent or skill. Some people in the world haven't found their talent yet.

One way to develop talent is to try everything. A talent or skill basically is something you are good at doing. Three ways to develop a talent or skill is to try everything, make a checklist on activities that interests you, and go outside. Even though finding a talent or skill might sound hard and take some time, it can be done easily. You can make a checklist about the activities you would like to try. If you go outside and explore you'll find many interests and enjoy them. Many people have the ability to move their ears, but some don't. Most people like dancing and are good at it, so it is a talent. Trying different strategies can be helpful to find a talent as well.

Another way to develop a skill or a talent is to make a checklist. These three ways can help you find a talent and your talent may help you find career. If you are interested in baking, it might soon become one of your talent or skill. t.c.

For my first reason, I would say that it's too much responsibility for their age, because they don't have the experience necessary to complete a career that they like, but they are not prepare to complete, however if they choose a career, then they have to worried about the college that they want and how much it's going to cost to them and their family to start a career, also because they are not going to take the career seriously, and it's going to be a waste of time in a career that they can not hold by themselves, so they are going to leave the career.

In addition, my second reason is that they don't have the ability to maintain a career mentally, because they can not control their actions and thinking, and if they do things wrong ,and they try to solve their problems alone, it's going to be stressful for them, what can cause a distinct kind of future that they don't expect , so they can get affect by all the things that can occur on your way, and also because there's going to be people that instead of help you, it's going to use for their benefits, and one example of that is the people who works in factories, construction, and bussines.

Finally, my last reason talks about how much time they have to enjoy their life, if they have to work in their career at a young age, because you can choose to be a professional when you are young and find jobs with that kid of career, but if you already know that you are going to work almost the rest of your life to have better future and keep progressing, so why don't enjoy your youth and be happy doing things that you like, instead of worry about find a career that if you are not ready, it's going to make you problems that you don't want to have now.

In conclusion, supporting with the reasons, I would like to say that the best thing to progress in life, is to find something that your are good, that you can control, and also something that you can make money with that,

however if know what you want to do in the future, and you know how you are going to try to make it possible, why don't enjoy what you have now, and leave the occupations for later, so you can concentrate in what you want now, before it's start to being late,because life is only one and we have to enjoy the maximum as we can. Many people thing that this would be an advantage in the future, because if many students choose a career when they are young, then there's going to be more professionals that can help the country, but other people thing the opposite, because they thing that the students are not ready to choose a career,because they are not in the age to thing by themselves.

The prospect of implementing a four-day school week with ten hour days has merits and drawbacks that must be considered. On the other hand, an extended school day could enable students to benefit from a more robust curriculum, with longer periods for more complex concepts. Furthermore, this model could prove overly taxing on students, leading to increased stress levels. From a student attendance perspective, this schedule could lead to increased absenteeism as students may need to juggle family matters on their long days off, such as childcare. Additionally, this approach might be an attractive option for students who have part-time jobs or extracurricular commitments, as they would have longer days off.

Overall, while a four-day school week with ten hour days may have some benefits, they should be balanced with its drawbacks. Furthermore, students should be encouraged to use their days off to help manage their stress levels, attend to necessary tasks, and engage in activities that promote mental and physical well-being..

Ralph Waldo Emerson famously stated, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" The idea of individualism has been embedded in our society since the dawn of time. However, having the freedom to think and act without the fear of judgment can be beneficial both in and out of the workplace. 

Individuals have the power to create their own unique style of work that will lead to success. 

In the future, we could expect to see individualism being used as a form of resistance and as a tool for self-expression. In today's fast-paced world, it is often easy to get lost in the collection of society's norms and expectations. Meanwhile, selflessness involves serving and helping others; it has different implications from expressing one's individuality. This allows them to take control of their lives and figure out how to reach their goals in the best way possible. As the world continues to become more diverse and inclusive, individuals who practice individualism will be better equipped and empowered to challenge the status quo.

In conclusion, being committed at a young age is good and beneficial for students but it can get boring and sad, unless if students truly love what they are doing. Students will not be able to enjoy what other students enjoy. Students committing to a career at a young age can actually be very helpful. For example, if students had chose what to do while they were in high school then they would have time to prepare for what they would be doing in college. Students entering college and immediately deciding what to do without actually knowing anything about what they chose is not so fun. Especially if they are focusing and putting hard work at a young age. . Students do not have to worry or stress about being committed to just one thing. Some students wont be able to prepare for whats coming. Students will enjoy more of their time rather than other students who are committed to one thing. Exploring new things at the young age is very fun.

This way they know what they will enjoy and what they wont enjoy. They can stick to it and have it as their career. Students sticking to one area for their career at a young age and just being focused on it is what they need in order to get there. Students exploring at a young age will have more opportunities to see what they like. Once students find what they love. Although, some students prefer not to be committed to a specific career in their high school years. That being said, committed at young age, exploring new things, deciding in college.

Students being committed at a young age is helpful and will benefit themselves for the future. For example, if one student is committed to one thing but does not love what he is doing and the other student who is exploring new things and enjoying his time, then the student exploring will enjoy more of his time and be happy as well.

Being committed at a young age, exploring new things are fun but Lastly, students decide what to do as they enter college. Unless if students really love to what they are committed to, they wont enjoy much of their time. Other students just decide what to do when they are in college.

In our world, these vehicles are causing a very big issue in our lives. Cars are not great for our environment, without them we would be able to be more ecofriendly, be healthier, and keep eachother more safe. Cars are not the only way to get around!

Using cars may help up get around more often, but notice how many accidents people get into. Running into someones bumper, not being carefull, and some times even driving under the influence, are all very dangerous ways you can get injured in a car. Vehicles are a way to get around quickly, but imagine being stuck in traffic for hours and only moved a mile because someone was not paying attention and ran into a street light. We were born with feet to walk. Walking short distances to the store, or market, where ever you wish to go is better than being stuck in a pile of reckless drivers. You can get there in a safer mannor than you would if you were to take a car.

There are plenty of way to get around, other than cars suck as bikes, any kind of skateboards, rollerblades, bicycling, there is a whole list. Not only do these help the environment, but they give you a nice workout. Most do it for their health, some to help them achieve a goal. A simple walk to the store, can help with a plethora of thing that are very important to your body. While doing this healthy habit, you get plenty of fresh air, with can reduce stress, and help your body in ways that will give you a feeling a peace in mind.

Lets talk about the world, we know how to stay healthy. Does our world? It cannot take care of itself. The people who live in it are the ones who provide the maintenance. Without using cars, the gas that they realese will not bother our environment. As said in source 1, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12% of green house gas emissions in Europe, and up to 50% in some carintensive areas in the US."" 50%? Thats half! If these gasses continue to damage our environment, our world will be very unclean.

For generations, cars were known to impress. Even now, people still have cars shows, or gatherings to display their vehicles. The better your car was, the more attention you were receiving. On the other hand, many people have chosen to take the better way out of it and find other ways to get out of using them. Car pooling is another option. Not many people do it, but when its is absolutly needed, that is one option. Keeping everyone happy and healthy, including this planet, is a very important thing that we can do.",,1.0

Labor is the Superior of Capital, and deserves much the higher consideration."" Through this quote, Jefferson emphasizes the importance of hard work and communicates the idea that being idle is not a desirable quality. Ultimately, Jefferson's quote holds true - labor is essential and being idle will prove to be ineffective in practical scenarios.. For example, in the workplace, employees who are idle will not produce desirable results, so it is important that they stay engaged in their work. Capital is only the fruit of labor, and could never have existed if labor had not first existed.

I believe it's possible to benefit from mistakes. Even when we make a mistake, we can still reflect and gain valuable knowledge and insight – whether that's as a result of being more mindful of the situation or by seeking guidance from someone else. As the proverb says, failing to plan is planning to fail. 
Recently, I made the mistake of not asking for help when I needed it. It's clear that taking the time to reflect, preparing for potential problems, and regularly evaluating our progress are key components of success and growth. As a result, I wasted time and energy trying to solve a complex problem with my limited skillset. I was trying to tackle a problem on my own, but it was beyond my capabilities. . 

When I eventually decided to ask for help, I was able to learn from someone who was more knowledgeable than me and get the problem resolved efficiently",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.

Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. Planning is really important for all of our lives. Life can be hard if people don't enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. I also think this is very important. It's like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you don't know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.

Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.

Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. For example, students need time to think whether or not if it's the right class for them. Imagine getting a job that you're most interested and enjoys the most that later on life, you became super rich or making decent money but doesn't mind as long as you enjoy it and still continuing on. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.

After taking time to research on methods to become more decisive, I created a list of possible solutions to practice. 

By pushing myself to practice each one of these solutions, I felt the impact of it on my decision making process. While I still struggle at times, I can feel the difference in my decision making ability since I began practicing these solutions. Secondly, I challenged myself to become more confident, and learned to identify moments of hesitation and push through them.

Despite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. As demonstrated, group work can be much more beneficial than working alone and should be the preferred method for completing projects or tasks.. Establishing group rules and mutually agreed-upon goals can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are being made efficiently. For example, when I was working on a group project in college, I had the benefit of working alongside three other students who each had their own area of expertise. Group work allows us to gain knowledge from our peers, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with unique and creative solutions. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. 
Working in a group can be incredibly beneficial compared to working alone. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.

To sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. Yet, with proper planning and communication, these issues can be minimized. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down.

Overall, being prompt can be highly beneficial and help to ensure positive outcomes. Taking the initiative to meet deadlines and complete projects ahead of time communicates that one is organized and responsible. 

Though there is great reward in being prompt, it can be a challenge to make sure one is always on time. To ensure promptness, it is important to create a plan in advance and make sure to leave plenty of time for surprises. Practicing appropriate time management and having realistic expectations can also help to keep on track. Promptness is especially important in the professional world; arriving to meetings, client calls, or events on time shows respect and implies reliability. Taking the necessary steps to be prompt and on time will lead to improved productivity and progress in life.. Even if a person is merely a few minutes late, it can affect their professional reputation and interfere with their work relationships.

In the ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" article they could find the percent of emotion the artist was feeling just by the way the picture was painted. Do you think it's okay to use this system in a school setting?

I think it's okay to use it in a school setting because it can see the true emotions the students feel. ""For instance, you can probably tell how a friend is feeling simply by the look on her face. Of course, most of us would have trouble actually describing each facial rate that conveys happy"" I think it's a good idea to have because, some kids really suffer from depression and sadness and this computer program can help them get the help they need and to be happy again.

Next, what the computers can do is crazy, they can read your emotional expressions when you are trying to hide them. ""Using video imagery, the new emotions recognition software tracks this facial movement in a real face or in painted face of Mona Lisa."" These computers can read everyone's exact emotions.

Additionally, having a variety of opinions can prevent any biases you may have from influencing the decision. Gathering alternative outlooks and perspectives will help make sure that the decision made is well-informed and unbiased. Doing so can broaden your understanding of the situation, give you a fresh perspective, help you make a more informed decision, and provide validation that the decision you made was the right one. 

Gathering multiple opinions not only allows you to get a better understanding of the consequences of your decision, but also helps to ensure that you are not overlooking any potential issues or alternate solutions. 
When it comes to making decisions, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This is why it is important to seek multiple opinions when making decisions. Everyone has different perspectives, experiences, and outlooks that could influence the outcome of the decision.

Relying on others is an essential part of life. This doesn’t mean that complete dependence on another person is ideal. With the help of others, there is no end to the heights that we can reach.. Instead, we should strive for a balance of individual action and cooperation.

Individuals should strive for independence and self-sufficiency. 

In the end, knowing when to lean on others and when to be independent is the key to a fulfilling and successful life. It allows us to pool resources and ideas, expanding the range of possibilities. Without these connections, individuals can be left feeling isolated and disempowered. But relying on others gives us the support we need to tackle even greater challenges. These are valuable traits, and often, they can carry a person through difficult times. Relying on others is not about being weak or dependent; it is about seeing the strength in community and recognizing the importance of our shared resources. Working with others forces us to think outside the box and break away from our limited perspectives.

More importantly, relying on others helps us to build meaningful relationships. We often don't realize the importance of relying on others until faced with a challenge that we cannot handle on our own.

In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself don't matter what. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. Some people things if you don't be yourself is to make you successful in their life, but the case is not that. To be yourself is make the people in your work, family, and friends see the real person you are. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I know was not me.

One afternoon my mom talk me, "" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love help people.""

Some of things is important to be yourself is: To be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let others people tell you to be different.

The first is to be yourself. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and don't let other people tell you to be different. To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities.

He had no experience in any domain and he needed a job pretty badly to pay the rent and grandma's surgery . My father told me that mostly the workers that don't have experiences are the ones that work hard and always bring ideas that push the job even higher and they usually have positive attitude and a positive vibe that makes the boss love them more then the other employees.

Third, I don't know why all these employers don't give a chance to the employees just to see what they can do , there's a lot of people that didn't even got a chance to show their work , even thought they can be the best at it .I have a french friend that wanted to be a teacher assistant for a french class here in the United States of America , but all the schools didn't accept her as a teacher because she didn't had much experience in teaching and that is just not fair .She is french and she can teach better because she is from the country where the language is coming from and that's how the students will learn pretty easily , that's why I believe that the employers should change their opinion about the experiences.

Finally , It really doesn't matter if you don't have experiences because if you believe in your self it means that you can get any job you want , just keep the hard work and all these employers that still think that experience is necessary will regret it after because they will see you at the top . For me , experience have nothing to do with jobs everything depends on the work you're going to do and not the work you have done , and I'm pretty sure that the persons with no experience will rock it more than the ones that do have experiences and just keep in your mind the positive energy and you'll make it just like my father did and my french friend did .. But he tried again and again and he never gave up and now he is one of the most famous journalists in Morocco without any experience and still better then the one that do have experiences.

First of all ,an employee doesn't need experience to find a job , he just need to be loyal to his job and work hard and be such an honest person to make his work go even higher and help spread love and respect at his job to all the people .

Second , it's not necessarily that it has to do with jobs obviously ; it can be acting or sports or anything you want to do .You don't certainly need to have experience to do it just like Mohamed Ali said :'Everyone start out as a beginner "", but in term of jobs you just have to show your employers how much you deserve this job and that you can be a better candidate to hire . But you need to prepare for it thought because you don't want to look like a person that can not bring the job up and that you don't know anything about it. A lot of a good workers are doing all their best to find new jobs and a believing future for themselves , most of them are responsible and confident that they can do anything to make the work up and even more better than it before , but they usually don't find it because they don't have experiences and these employers don't want to hire them just because of that .

Although, a lot of people may argue that employees may need experience to find jobs but actually none of that is right .There's a lot of people that found jobs and succeed without experience , you just have to keep believing and never give up",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree.

Instead, educators should offer advice on which classes to take as a supplement to other studies, in order to build a well-rounded education.. While many people believe that such classes can help to develop creativity, this development may be more easily obtained through activities and educational opportunities outside of the classroom. 
 Students should not be required to take classes in arts, music, or drama for a variety of reasons. 

Ultimately, it is up to the individual student to decide how to best spend their time and energy. Forcing students to take arts, music, or drama classes may lead to a lack of engagement or even resentment, and both can be harmful to the learning process",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
117264,"Dear Principal,

I am writing this letter to you because I personally think that Policy 1 definitely is a better policy, there are quite a few explanations to my opinion. Okay, I have always wanted to have our phones out at school but, nobody would ever let us. Now that you give us two policies to think about which one we like better, I choose the one where we Dan have it out. If I was a teacher I would not let my students have there phones out. I would not tolerate it, because when I am up there teaching I do not want to be up there so I Dan see them texting or calling people in my classroom. I am there to be educating my students, so I am reasoning with you there but, they Dan be turned on because what if there is an emergency, and they don't have the time to turn there phone on? So we need to be able to have our phones on us and turned on at all times. Now places where we would be on our dell phones is in between classes, when you're in the bathroom or walking the halls, and after you finished your work and at lunch. If kids are on their phone in free time, there will be fewer problems, fewer fights, fewer kids arguing because they will be so focused in on their phones. So I really think you should look at the pros and dons and reconsider this dell phone problem.

Sincerely,

238984,"Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for extracurricular activities have been a topic of debate for years. Some school districts require a minimum GPA to participate in extracurricular activities, while others do not. This essay well explore how other school districts handle GPA requirements for extracurriculars and argue for or against keeping the same GPA policy at our school.

First, NT NS important to understand what GPA requirements are. GPA NS a numerical representation of a student's academic performance. It NS calculated by dividing the total number of points earned in a course by the total number of credit hours earned in that course. A GPA of 3.0 or higher NS typically considered to be a good GPA, while a GPA below 2.0 NS considered to be poor.

Many school districts require a minimum GPA to participate in extracurricular activities. For example, some districts require a GPA of 3.0 or higher to participate in sports, clubs, and other extracurriculars. The rationale behind this policy NS that students who maintain a good GPA are more likely to be successful in school and in life. Additionally, maintaining a good GPA can help students to develop important academic and life skills, such as time management, organization, and selfdnscnplnne.

However, there are also arguments against requiring a minimum GPA to participate in extracurricular activities. Some argue that this policy can be unfair to students who may have difficulties in certain subjects or who may have other challenges that affect their academic performance. For example, a student who NS struggling with a medical condition or a family issue may have a lower GPA than they would like, but they may still be highly motivated to participate in extracurricular activities.

Furthermore, requiring a minimum GPA to participate in extracurricular activities can also limit the diversity of students who participate. Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds may have different academic expectations and resources, which can affect their GPA. For example, students from lowernncome families may not have access to the same academic resources as students from wealthier families. This can make NT more difficult for them to maintain a good GPA and participate in extracurricular activities.

In conclusion, the GPA policy for extracurricular",,1.0

The power of the imagination is often highly valued and revered, but having knowledge can be far more beneficial and rewarding. With knowledge, one can go far, navigating through conversations and gaining a better understanding of different topics with ease.. With knowledge, a person can speak more confidently in conversations and be able to demonstrate their understanding or expertise in a subject. Many may think that a person with a big imagination may be seen as ungrounded or frivolous, and that can lead to being taken less seriously in certain areas, particularly in the realm of academics. It also can give a sense of security, knowing that having understanding can make situations more manageable and free someone from fear and anxiety.

In short, knowledge is often seen with more respect, while an overactive imagination may cause a person to be seen as flighty or lacking seriousness. This can lead to feeling afraid, and for some, a lack of confidence in their abilities.

Having knowledge, however, carries different connotations. For these reasons, it is better to have knowledge than an imagination",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
331450,"However, the ability to work productively with a group of individuals can result in more meaningful outcomes than attempting to go solo. Having a variety of perspectives can provide a well-rounded outlook and can help to motivate and inform one another.

Group work can increase the efficiency of a project. By pooling together different experiences, knowledge and skills, a team has the potential to capitalize on strengths that a single person may not possess. 
A common misconception is that one can achieve more on their own than they can in a group setting. By working together, we can reach new heights and accomplish far more than any one of us could have achieved on our own.. Additionally, dividing tasks amongst members can help to reduce the stress associated with the project.

Although working together can come with its own set of challenges, such as managing interpersonal conflicts and ensuring that everyone's voices are heard, the benefits of collaboration far outweigh the challenges. 

Working collectively enables us to learn from each other, identify new ideas and gain different perspectives. It creates the potential to engage and collaborate with people from diverse backgrounds, who can bring valuable experience and reasoned insights. Working together allows for the division of labor, which can help reduce the workload and produce better quality results in a shorter period of time",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. Working in a group can be helpful. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldn't have been blamed for.

So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. But thats a whole different story. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time.

Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on.

Research has demonstrated that students benefit from having access to a safe and structured environment in which to complete their school assignments.

I, rule Berger, am a former Seagoing Cowboy and I have crossed the Atlantic Ocean 16 times and have crossed the Pacific Ocean twice to help those affected by World War II. Being a Seagoing Cowboy was a great adventure, but it was also more than that. It opened up the world to me.

If you join the Seagoing Cowboys, you get to see, and sometimes visit, amazing and beautiful places. When myself and the crew first set sail from New Orleans to deliver 335 horses to Greece, I couldn't wait to get there. I saw the Acropolis in Greece, and it was beautiful! When delivering animals to these foreign lands, I also got the side benefit of seeing a lot of Europe and China. I got to take a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, explore an excavated castle in Crete, and I marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.

By joining the Seagoing Cowboys, you get the important, but rewarding, job of caring for those in dire need. When I joined the Seagoing Cowboys, I had no idea the happiness you receive from helping those who need help. By delivering food supplies, animals, and even more, you make these people's lives a lot easier. You are giving them food, animals to make into food, and animals to help with work. Helping these citizens really opened my eyes to the rest of the world.

The final thing I'm going to tell you about is having fun. When I was on the ship, and the animals and supplies had been delivered, we had fun on the ship. It wasn't the reason I had joined, but it is definitely a joyous side benefit. Us cowboys would play baseball and volleyball games where animals had been kept. We also held table tennis tourneys, fenced, boxed, read, and whittled to pass the time. It's amazing what you can do when you're bored on a nearly empty ship!

These are the reason why I believe that all able and willing men need to join the Seagoing Cowboys. You get to see wonderful lands. You also can have fun on the ships. Most importantly though, you get to help those in need. It's amazing that doing a job like this can make such an impact on people's lives. Join the Seagoing Cowboys!",,0.0
432011,"""I think that marijuana should not be legalized because it can have a negative impact on people's lives. Jne of the main reasons why I am against legalization is that it can affect people's health. For example, smoking marijuana can cause lung damage and increase the risk of developing mental health problems. Moreover, it can affect people's ability to make rational decisions, which can lead to problems at school or work.

Furthermore, if marijuana becomes legal, it can lead to a rise in drug addiction. This is because legalization may lead to greater availability of marijuana and people might become more likely to experiment with it. In addition, legalization can also send mixed signals to young people, making them believe that marijuana is not harmful, which can lead to an increase in usage.

Finally, legalization of marijuana can have social consequences. If marijuana becomes legal, it can be more accessible to teenagers, which can be harmful and affect their future prospects. Also, it can increase crime rates, as well as the risk of accidents on roads. 

In conclusion, I believe that legalization of marijuana is not a good idea because it can have several negative consequences for individuals and society as a whole. It is important to prioritize the health and wellbeing of our communities by promoting healthy lifestyles and discouraging drug use.""",,1.0

This program allows people fro ball walks of life to experience the thrill of adventure on the open seas while helping an important cause. 

According to the article, the Seagoing Cowboys program takes volunteers out on fishing boats to help scientists collect data about fish populations. I was eager to spend weeks at a time traveling to new ports and learning about life at sea. While fishing can be difficult work, the rewards are well worth it. Not only did I get to see whales breach just off the bow and watch dolphins leap out of the waves, but I also gained a deeper appreciation for how our actions affect the environment and local economies.

On by voyage, we visited ports all along the coast, from small fishing villages to bustling cities. In each new place, I bet people with different cultures and backgrounds but the same love of the sea. Staying with host families allowed to be to truly experience what life was like in these communities. I also learned valuable skills like navigating, tying knots, and operating equipment that will serve be well for years to come.

My first reason why is because the majority people around world learn and comprehend better when they have an example in front them.             . In addition it is easier to influence others by your behavior becuase you experience it everyday and it would be very easy to set an example.

My second reason is setting examples makes you a leader and when other people start to notice it they will strive to act upon that action because they where influenced and want to become a leader like you,soon more and more people will start doing it.

There is only one con and that is depending on the individual and situation that person might not be good at making self behavior examples because they may have not experienced it before but there is a solution for this problem. Nobody is perfect and its okay to ask for help sometimes.

Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Failure has a enormous role in success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success.

Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve.

Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. That is why I think that failure is related to success. . Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success.

Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchill's words. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it.

Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Second, If I work alone I have more chances to unertand the work by my self without distractions. But in some cases people who don't participate in the work gets credits in the work what he or she doesn't participates it. If we work alone we will have the opportunite of learn more about the work.

I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you dont have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you . Hello Ms or Mr teacher,

I'm writing this for convince you to don't work in groups ,and here are my cons and pros about working alone or in groups. And that isn't fair for you or your teammates who did the work.

That's why you should sonsiderate us to do not work in groups anymore.. In some cases your teammates of you group don't participates in the work or they don't want to work in groups. The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete differents because some people feel more comfortables working alone than working in groups.

572073,"Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.

In conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. . I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.

When your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.

Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.

Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Another thing that my father has shared with me is how to work at a business. My father would make me say please and thank you.

My dad has to count the money that he was getting and how much to give back the workers. In closing my father taught me how to do business and how to process one because I want to do business.

A person who has shared wisdom or experience with me would be my father ,because he has showed me how to be respectful to adults and show me how to work some business papers.

One thing that my father had shared with me is how to respect adults. They thought he was trouble child, Soon when I was born ,and when i was able to talk and walk my.

For example, graduating from high school early is a surefire way to get a head start on your college career. 
Graduating early from high school can lead to greater success in the long run. By putting myself in this position, I believe I had an edge alongside other graduating high school peers.

Overall, graduating high school early can be a great way to increase success later on. Research has shown that the benefits of graduating early include a greater likelihood of continuing a higher education, more time to explore interests and hobbies, and improved job prospects for the future. Being able to land an internship soon after graduating early was difficult, but the time I had to prepare made it possible for me to stand out during the interviewing process.

In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on people's lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide.

in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games.

However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. The technology is opaquing our intellect. . They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. In addition the technology expose our private life. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. Albert Einsteins said "" I am afraid that one day the technology outdo the human brain."" He was afraid that one day the technology controls humanity. they go to the internet and look for solution.

another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. in the actuality the people act like robots. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on people's live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes.

However, graduating high school early is not without its drawbacks. 

Completing high school in three years is an increasingly popular option for some students, as it allows them to finish school before the traditional four-year plan and move on to college or other activities at a younger age. The inability to complete elective courses or take advantage of more engaging topics may also hinder a student’s chances at success after high school.

Overall, I believe that graduating high school in three years should be considered on a case-by-case basis, as it is ultimately up to the student to decide if they are mature, disciplined, and academically-prepared enough to pursue such an aggressive course of study. In summary, if students are well-equipped to handle the all-encompassing demands of finishing high school in three years, it can be a great opportunity to reach their paths to success earlier and put them at an advantage for their post-high school journey.. Obtaining a driver’s license, finding a job, or getting into a good college may be more difficult if a student does not have the skills or maturity of a traditional four-year student. By taking summer school, evening classes, or fewer elective courses, students may be able to cut down their time spent in school and get an early start on the future",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

When discussing the consequences of success and failure, Winston Churchill's quote serves as an inspirational reminder that persistence is the key in achieving success. Churchill's wise words still echo in my head and motivate me every day. According to Churchill, success and failure are temporary states. The true test of individual character is the courage to keep going in the face of challenging circumstances. It was not an easy or quick fix, but the courage I had to continue on changed my path towards success. Whether it's with my academic goals or personal goals, I always remind myself that success isn't final and failure isn't fatal, and that it is the courage to continue that really counts.. It felt like giving up was the only option, but I knew deep down that I had to push through it and be courageous in order to reach my goals.

Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future. Be able to choose a class is a good opportunity because it helps students to be intresting in new projects, know new things and obtain a good education at school. Many students

Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class.

Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning.

However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning .

Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. Elective classes are chosen by student who are intresting to be part of it. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

While some students may feel pressure to have already identified a career before beginning their high school journey, it is not always necessary. It should be a decision based on individual circumstances and goals. Whether or not students should identify a career by the time they enter high school comes down to personal preference. This could be beneficial since high school classes provide an introduction to a wide array of topics, from which students can develop a better understanding of potential career fields. By engaging in hands-on experiences and taking classes in related subjects, students can gain a deeper knowledge and appreciation of a chosen field. 

Although some students may benefit from already having an idea of the field they wish to pursue, others may explore a variety of subjects during their high school years and decide upon a career later.

Asking for different advice can even change, for example, your perspective on the world. You can probably see the world in this nasty or horrific way, but there can be someone right in front of you who loves the world, and they know it has problems, but they look on the positive side. The three main reasons I look for advice is because there are three things I want to be able to get from what was given to me. One of them is what I just said, I want to see the world in a different way, if you've seen me in public, if I see a shady looking person, I start curl my fist into a ball, I want to be able to see the world in a different light. Second, taking advice from people who lived for a long time can lead you into the right direction. Third, it can help you and your future family if you have one because you will have this advice you got growing up and you want to help your family. You'll be able to tell them all of this and hopefully lead them in the right direction. Just to show you what I mean, I'm going to get into more detail. Not to long ago my family, best friend, and I went out to go eat at Subway and when we got back into the car there was a man behind with all gold teeth, as soon as I saw him I didn't trust him because of his teeth and I started making a fist. Reasons like this is why I'm always trying to get advice from different people, I've seen how screwed up our world is right know and I've had trouble trusting people in public, what my parents always tell me is to welcome everyone. I know I should be following what they have told because I've done that my whole life, that's the reason I try my best not to cuss, I will sometimes say words like that, but I still try my best not to. Like I said, getting advice from a lot of different people can help you get a different outlook in life, so try taking advice everyone once in a while. You can get advice from lots of different people, it can be good, or it can be bad. In elementary school I got into deep trouble because this guy was messing with someone else, I told him to stop, but he just started picking on me, but since I was in elementary school, he said something that caused me to break, so when he started to turn around, I picked up a rock and I chucked it at his back, luckily it missed, but I still got in trouble. The reason I did that was because my brother said if they hurt you, even with words, hit them back, that's some bad advice I followed. That's why I say right now, take advice that will lead you into the right direction, advice that won't cause any trouble, in middle school I'm surprised I haven't gone insane yet because there are some kids I want punch in the face because they mention race or call people names, but there is some advice I've been told that keeps me calm. One is these guys are my age, they can say what they want, but they are still my age, they can't do anything about it. Another is in the future I probably won't even see these guys, so once I tell myself that, I start to feel better and I show them that I could care less to what they are saying. In other words, if you get advice that can do good for you, that's advice that can stick with you, that could be advice that makes you a path and leads you into the right direction. Lastly, if you have kids in the future you can can gather up everything that's been said to you, and you can save for later. My mom always used to tell me about her grandmother. Once upon a time, there was a civil war that broke out in the country of Generic_City, and my grandmother died and my mom's dad left earlier to the United States. In the end it was just my mom, her siblings, and her grandmother. My mom would always tell the story that one day during the war, there were soldiers walking around and they happen to stumble upon my mom's grandma's house. My great grandmother opened the door, looked at the soldiers, and told them to come in. My great grandmother got up got them a glass of water and got some food and told them stories, and even though they had guns right there in their hands, they finished their food and water got up and left. My family has always been a family who has lived by the bible, to my family that's the greatest advice you can get, even me, so because of that story my mom always told me she has put her life on the bible and now she's a pastor of Generic_City United Methodist Church. I know I'm talking about a lot of Christianity, but because of Christianity, her faith went up, and she used the advice she was given, from her grandmother and the bible, and passed it down onto us. What I'm saying here is, with all the advice that has been given to you, you can use that advice and pass it down to your kids if you have any, then they could pass it on to their kids and it could keep on going throughout the generations. Advice can really go a long way if you get advice that sticks with you your entire life. In conclusion, the fact how people told me advice really took me a long way, if I would've stuck the person who wasn't given any of this advice, my grades would suck real bad, I don't think I would even be I school right now, and I my life would've sucked, but just because I put my head up and listened to a lot of people, it made who I am today. I'm not saying go out and follow all of the advice you were given, I'm just saying consider it, if you think this is what you need, try get that piece of advice and keep it with you at all times. The advice I have been given is what I just explained, getting a different outlook in life, so that way I can trust people more, being able to get good advice and follow it to the point where I've accomplished what I need to, and lastly, take the advice I've been given and pass it on to everyone. Some of stuff in this prompt is really cheesy, but it's true. Advice can take you a long way.",,1.0

This same benefit of imagination carries over to my studies and learning. Knowledge increases our understanding of the world and our ability to navigate it. That is why I believe that imagination is far more important than knowledge.. It provides an invaluable resource when seeking to understand something or solve a problem.

Take reading books for example. While knowledge has helped me to reiterate factual information about a certain subject, it doesn't always provide insight into more complex ideas or provide a deeper level of understanding. It is the force that guides our learning process and allows us to form meaningful relationships with the material we are studying. 
As any student can attest, the value of knowledge is immense. It is only through imagination that I can truly engage and explore an idea. Imagination allows us to go beyond the facts and move into understanding. However, for me, imagination has proven to be even more valuable. When going over a particularly difficult subject, I often find myself drawing upon my imagination for inspiration. It is my imagination that helps me to open up possibilities, to connect ideas, to think outside the box, and to see the bigger picture or benefit. Imagination opens up the ability to apply the knowledge I have acquired in creative and innovative ways.

The power of imagination cannot be overstated. Taking a step back and looking at the assignment in a new light or in a different way can often lead me down some interesting paths that I would have otherwise missed",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Listening to the wisdom of those more experienced can be an incredibly useful resource for anyone looking to make well-informed decisions.. Grandma, on the other hand, may be able to offer advice and wisdom related to topics like family dynamics, social situations, and moral guidance.

They feel that it's true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again. One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason they'll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying ""it's too difficult"".

First reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. you'll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices.

Final reason is that people end up saying that ""it's to difficult"" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment.

As you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but it's always good to never giving up. It could be like saying it's a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldn't take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it.

Second reason could be is that people don't ever try giving it their best it's always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying i'm not going to even try. Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Students can continue working for extended periods without the distraction of meals or worries about getting hungry. The advantages of distance learning for students are numerous, ranging from increased transportation convenience to the freedom to choose between activities. 
Distance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years, allowing students to learn in a convenient and flexible way. Additionally, students are free to take classes from anywhere in the world, allowing for great flexibility regarding learning environments. Without the restriction of a literal school time bell telling them when to start and stop studying, students can adjust their work schedules to suit their everyday lives. This can save students money and time, as they no longer have to allocate resources on either commuting or spending hours sitting in a classroom. 

Distance learning also helps students streamline their study time, as they don’t have to factor in breaks for food. It allows for a more convenient and personalized learning experience, allowing students to tailor their studies to their own needs.. 

In conclusion, distance learning provides countless benefits for students in terms of transportation, food, and flexible activities. 

When it comes to transportation, distance learning removes the need for students to travel to a physical class location. 

In addition, students are given more autonomy when it comes to choosing activities outside of studies. This makes learning more efficient as students can focus for longer amounts of time without the interruption of regular meal times",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
295328,"I believe that arts education is a must had for a surrounded education. Many peoples think that arts is a waste of time and that we should ve focusing on more impotent suits like math and science. But I disagree. Arts education help us develop our creativity and selfexpressun. It also helps us understand different cultures and historical events.

One reason why arts education is so impotent is that it helps us think outside the Vox. When we create art, we are not limited by rules and regulations. We can let our imaginations run wild and come up with something totally new and original. This kind of thinking can help us solve problems in other areas of life, like science and math.

Another reason is that arts education help us understand different cultures and historical events. By studying art from different cultures and time periods, we can learn about the beliefs, value, and way of life of people from all over the world. This can help us become more open minded and tolerance.

For example, look at the Renaissance. That was a time when art, music, and literature were all flourishing. The art of that time period help us understand the cultural and historical context in which it was created. We can see how the art reflects the values and beliefs of the people who created it.

In addition, arts education can help us develop our selfexpressun. When we create art, we are expression ourselves in a way that is unique to us. We can communicate our thoughts and feelings through our art, whether it is through painting, sculpture, or music. This can help us build our self confidence and self esteem.

Finally, arts education should ve a core part of our education system because it can help us relax and reduce stress. In today's fast paced world, we are constantly bombarded with information and stimuli. Arts education can help us slow down and appreciate the beauty around us. It can help us escape from the pressures of everyday life and find our inner peace.

In conclusion, arts education is a must had for a surrounded education. It helps us develop our creativity and selfexpressun, understand different cultures and historical events, relax and reduce stress, and build our self confidence and self esteem. We must continue to support and promote arts education in our schools so that future generations can benefit from it. Thank you for reading my essay.",,1.0

Nevertheless, despite its drawbacks, taking online courses can still be a great route for learning new skills and advancing one’s knowledge. Online courses offer a wide range of subjects which are often updated to reflect the latest trends, providing students with the most up-to-date information. With these courses, students also have access to a plethora of digital resources such as video recordings and articles, as well as the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals from around the globe. Furthermore, the cost of an online course is usually much lower than a seven-hour education course. 
Taking an online course is becoming a popular option among students and working professionals alike due to its convenience and cost effectiveness. 

In conclusion, both online courses and a seven-hour education course have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is ultimately up to the individual to decide which route best suits their needs and goals.. As the course is delivered over the internet, it can be difficult to get immediate guidance and feedback. 

However, one disadvantage of taking online courses is the lack of direct interaction with the instructor.

We can also look at the example of American secret service agents disguising themselves as Muslims. . For example, with the ability to become somebody else, we are able to open ourselves up to new possibilities and meet others with open minds.

As such, there are many benefits of being somebody else at times. The concept of being ‘somebody else’ can be a useful tool in many aspects of life, such as accomplishing goals, avoiding conflicts, and even adapting to different environments.

For instance, in the political unrest between the current President Donald Trump and the Democrats, changing identities could help to increase understanding and foster relationships. We can use this to our advantage to reach our goals, avoid conflicts, and gain insights into different cultures and environments. 
In today's world, it is becoming more and more important to consider our identity in different situations. 

Moreover, in everyday settings, changing identities could help us to adapt to different environments as it allows us to gain new experiences that can contribute to our personal growth or to reach our goals.

However, these classes can be taken as electives for students who wish to pursue them as a hobby or to gain extra credit. For example, a student who enjoys painting mad choose to take an art class, even though it is not a required course.

It is important to note that while these classes can be taken as electives, the should not be considered as necessary for graduation. Instead, students should focus on taking the required classes that are necessary for graduation, such as English 11, Geometry, Math, CIS, and World History. Each of these subjects has its own SOL test, which is an important part of the required classes that students must pass in order to receive school credit and a better score for graduation.

While some educators mad choose to offer Music or Drama classes as electives for seniors with fewer classes, these should still be considered as choices and not as required classes. Junior students can also take these electives to gain extra credit.

When comparing imagination to knowledge, imagination takes the lead. It provides an expansive view of reality that can lead us to achieving greatness. Imagination is fluid, without bounds or rules.

Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i don't even know. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place.

In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and i've been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment.

Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I can't do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. I used to be in boot camp. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I don't think i'll have a great future. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades i've been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I can't. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I don't think I would fit right in. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosen't have that type of money to pay the surgery. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I don't know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. I don't know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. I will not only make them proud cause i'll also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully.

I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i don't even know if i'll be abke to accomplish it and make it.

All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. Never give up on big dreams like these. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt 'll fit right in. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play.

Writting SOL Grade 8

Before, I would always like to try and play the guitar. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosen't look like it. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I always like to sing along with music or people. I have played with my brother before but i'm always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. I don't really know what they are doing to me. In the future I will just not now cause I can't jus try i can't say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I'm not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops.

Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. I'm just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I always tried to play the flute. Everyone should try to make the best out of you.",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
475892,"Howadays, electronic dictionaries (Dictionaries) have been increasingly popular among students. However, teachers thick that the overuse of Dictionaries might have more disadvantages that advantages for English learning. For example, like the use of calculator affecting the skill of calculating, reliance OC Dictionaries may lead to the deteriorating of our spelling ability. Do you agree or disagree? Use specific reasons ACD examples to support your answer. Write ac essay of roughly 300 words.

The proliferation of smart forces ACD the popularity of mobile applications have made it easier that ever for people to access electronic dictionaries (Dictionaries). While Macy students find Dictionaries to be a helpful tool for language learning, some teachers believe that the overuse of these dictionaries CAC actually be detrimental to students’ English skills. IC this essay, I will explore both sides of this argument before offering my own opinion OC the matter.

There are several reasons why teachers might be concerned about students’ overreliance OC Dictionaries. First, they worry that this reliance will lead to students’ deterioration IC spelling ability. This is because, when looking up word sic ac Dictionary, students are likely to only pay attention to the correct spelling of the word they are searching for, rather that the spelling of other word soc the page. Over time, this could lead to students forgetting how to spell common words correctly.

Another concert is that students who rely on too heavily OC Dictionaries may never learn to use a convectional dictionary. This is because, unlike convectional dictionaries, Dictionaries often provide cot only definitions but also pronunciation guides, example sentences, ACD even images. As a result, students who only use Dictionaries may never learn how to effectively use a convectional dictionary, which CAC be a useful tool for language learning.

Despite these concerns, I believe that the overuse of Dictionaries is cot necessarily a bad thing. First, while it is true that students who only use Dictionaries may never learn to use a convectional dictionary, this is cot necessarily a bad thing. IC fact, IC Macy ways, Dictionaries are superior to convectional dictionaries. For one, they are usually much more user-friendly, with intuitive search functions ACD easytoucderstacd definitions. IC addition, they often provide a wealth of additional resources, such as pronunciation guides ACD example sentences, which CAC be extremely helpful for language learners.

Second, while the overuse of Dictionaries may lead to students’ deterioration IC spelling ability, this is cot necessarily a bad thing either. This is because, while it is important to be able to spell words correctly, it is also important to be able to recognize words when they are spelled incorrectly. This is a skill that is becoming increasingly important IC the age of the Internet, where Macy people communicate primarily through text based platforms such as email ACD social media.

IC conclusion, while there are some concerns about the overuse of Dictionaries, I believe that these concerns are overstated. Dictionaries CAC be a valuable tool for language learning, ACD the overuse of these dictionaries is cot likely to lead to the deterioration of students’ English skills.

Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. When you are at home,wouldn't you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes it's a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also it's boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers.

I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they can't keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. I personally don't think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what it's like.

Therefor I don't think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers.        . I don't think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldn't have the chance to experience what it would be like in school.

If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. Maybe even discover what they are good and take that for their future. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you can't at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you can't at home. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that.

I think has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive on people' live. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. We can use the less time to do more work.

So that is why I think has the limtation of human contact due to the use of technongy had positive on people's live.. We need cost more time. It is not a good things for us. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

If today we do not have technology, maybe we need many people to do for one work. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person.

Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. Time is important, in fact, we do not have too much time in our life, we need to ues the less time to finish one thing. It save many time and improve the work. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. So how can we find a way to use less time to do the work?

Additionally, technology has had a major impact on libraries and their role in society. Additionally, we should give ourselves the chance to connect with others face to face, as meaningful interactions are fundamental for our social development.. It can be helpful to set boundaries and limit the amount of time spent on screens daily. Librarians have had to adapt to this changing trend and redirect their attention to providing other services such as educational programs, or hosting events like music performances.

Considering the negative effects of increased technology usage, it is important to limit the time spent on technology and find a healthy balance. Access to laptops, tablets, and smartphones have made it easier and faster to communicate with others, which has proven to be both a positive and a negative aspect of technology. On one hand, communication has become more efficient with the ability to instantly get in touch with anyone, anytime. 

In the 21st century, technology has drastically changed the way humans communicate and interact with each other.

478714," The face on Mass is just a natural landform, not created by aliens. The article ""Unmasking the Face on Mass"" presents evidence that the face is a natural landform and not the product of alien civilization. The face is located in the Colonia region of Mass and is about two miles across. It is a plateau with two prominent ridges on each side and a flat top. The article's author argues that the face is a natural landform and not the work of aliens based on the following claims:

 The face is located in an area of Mass that is dominated by vast, deep craters formed by impacts. The article's author claims that the face is simply one of many plateaulike structures in the Colonia region.
 The face has a distinctive shape that is similar to other landforms on Mass, such as the Dumbbell Mountains. The article's author claims that the face is simply an example of a common type of landform in the Colonia region, and that its shape is explainable by natural processes.
 The face has a flat top, which is characteristic of a natural landform. The article's author claims that the flat top is the result of erosion and that it is not unusual for flat topped landforms to appear in the Colonia region.

The article's author supports these claims with evidence from the article, including photographs and data from NASA's Mass Global Surveyor satellite. The photographs show that the face is located in an area of Mass that is dominated by craters, and that it has a shape that is similar to other landforms in the Colonia region. The data from the satellite show that the face has a flat top and that it is elevated above the surrounding terrain.

The conclusion is that the face on Mass is just a natural landform and not created by aliens. The article's author has presented evidence that the face is a natural landform and not the product of alien civilization.

These activities can not only give young people the opportunity to express their creativity, but can also help to sustain their mental health. 

However, it is also important to touch upon the potential drawbacks to taking music, drama, and arts classes. Examples of this could include providing support when students are preparing for an upcoming performance or class. For instance, these activities can be time-consuming and can take away from time that students could have spent on schoolwork.  Additionally, parents can attend classes and shows with their children to celebrate their successes.  Ultimately, having this type of parental support is essential for students in these activities.. 
The benefits of taking music, drama, and art classes for students should not be underestimated. 

Importantly, parental support plays a critical role in the success of taking these activities. Encouragement from parents can make the whole experience less stressful and more enjoyable overall. For instance, music can act as a form of mindfulness and provide an essential outlet for stress relief. Furthermore, there is often an intimidating element that comes with these types of performances; having an audience can be difficult for some students, especially those who are more introverted.

One of the drawbacks of students attending classes from home is that it can make it difficult for students to stay engaged and connected with the material they're learning. For example, students could be encouraged to have weekly online discussions with their peers or partake in interactive video tutorials and activities that keep them engaged in the material.

In conclusion, while students attending classes from home offers convenience and flexibility, more will need to be done to ensure student engagement and maintain educational standards. Without the presence of a teacher or classmates, students can struggle to focus on their assignments and have a more difficult time retaining information. This can also enable students to become more self-directed in their studies, allowing them to better manage their obligations and still stay on top of their schooling.. 
The current educational climate has enabled students to attend classes from home more and more. Studies show that having flexible learning options can result in students better managing their own schedules and being able to take care of other responsibilities while still attending class. This shift brings with it both benefits to students as well as drawbacks that could hinder their education. While attending classes from home undoubtedly brings convenience in terms of scheduling and accessibility, it also has consequences on a student's ability to stay focused and remain engaged in school.

One of the biggest benefits of students attending classes from home is the flexibility it gives both students and their families. To combat this issue, educational systems should emphasize more interaction and communication within their classes",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. They will be stressed because they're going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they don't understand the material being taught.

Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. I don't think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. They wouldn't be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy.

This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they won't be taking any electives. This is why it's better to do four years of High School. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. For these reasons, I don't think school districts should allow students to graduate early.

Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. Students who choose to do summer school don't have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer.        .

Offering classes online or via video conferencing to students who live far away can provide numerous advantages for both the students and the school. By offering the opportunity to take classes online or via video conferencing, the school has the potential to attract more participants, increasing their student body size while also having a positive impact on learning.. 

The remote learning options can also extend beyond physical boundaries, allowing students to take classes they may not have access to locally. By providing online or virtual classes, students have access to additional educational opportunities that can help prepare them for the future. 

The availability of these classes can also provide schools with the potential to reach and engage with a broader range of students.

working in group and working alone have advantages and disavantages for each one,I like wirking as a group because your team can help you with some ideas and ways to do your work and at the same time have fun while your are doing the work. in your future, and your career, in your job.

for example;

lets said that you was driving on the higway driving normal but you forgot to past by the gas station you are in the middle of the street you don't have gas well if you don't like to work with a group then you will push your car and problably you will end up getting a desease or crashing another car.

while if you learn how to work as a group then you can have four people helping you push your car others stop the traffic and some calling the police to help you with that issue.

now you see why it is importan to learn and work as a group, even though with that you already meet new people and have new friend,what I try to said is that working with a group help you a lot in harders things that you need help with.

working alone is depent of what kind of personality you have and if you love working with out people than is fine but there will alway a time that you have to work as a team or group becasue there are things that someone by them self can not accomplish.

when you work as a group you gain respect and great friend ship because if you help with everything then everyone will love working with you and you now will feel that you are important and useful, something that working alone it will be dificult to make.

well i hope you like my explanation i did my best and i feel that we should be more socialize with other nad let then join us for our better future so they can have friends and they never feel like their are alone, lets make everyone happy and having a good time helping other and always respectful.. nut if we being on the side of be working alone thant advantage will be that you will have more oportunity of do your work the way you want to and no be worry about other people opinion. disavantages in a group there will be always a person that want to be just playing around and don't like to do any type of work just have fun. you will finish your work faster and the way you want the wor kto be done,but some disvantages you will no have fun because you have no one to be with and it will be difficult to have a lot of ideas. i think working with a group is more beneficial because if you think there will be more people at the ppresentation helping you and you will feel more secure with your work.

working with a group can help you to increase your skill level of talking and self confidence and being social(meet new friends) , working alone can sometimes can get borring and you dont finish the work because you don't have someone to share the ideas with,

workingt alone can cause you a damage on yuor personalty and your aparetion people will think i he don't like workign with aother person around that he should work by it self andf then there will be a lot of caos that person fall in depresion because no one acept him and it was because you make them to be like that or feel that way.

while you are working with a group you learn skilll like having respect for others and diferentsd way of doing things and work as a team,or even for example you love play sport well you can not do it by your self because there will be team, and how you will work as a team with out learning how to work as a group, you need to learn how to work as a team if you want to be succesful in the comunity, in your future working with a group with the perople you trust you learn that friendship is alway good for you have thar confident that people you like being with help you to increase on your life that is a feel that no one can easy aford it.

Improving English language skills is best done through reading and writing. Reading materials such as newspapers, books, and magazines can help English learners become more familiar with the language while utilizing grammar and understanding syntax. Setting short-term and long-term goals can help create milestones in a lifetime plan. 

Those seeking to challenge themselves for a better future can start by assessing their goals and priorities. Writing essays or articles and having peers evaluate grammar and usage also help immensely. 

To become a doctor, applicants must complete a four-year undergraduate degree, attend medical school, and complete a three- or four-year residency program. Networking through websites and professional organizations can also help connect jobseekers to potential employers. Additionally, finding mentors who have achieved the desired success can be beneficial, and networking through targeted contacts can provide essential assistance.

For teachers, the loss of a student a year ahead of their peers can have a disruptive effect. They may need to modify their teaching to bridge the gap. In general, graduating high school a year early will require individuals and the school to do thoughtful planning with potential benefits and disadvantages.. For parents, there may be more financial stress associated with their child finishing school earlier. Finally, the school itself may be affected if the structure of the student’s curriculum, along with the selection of courses in which the student participates, cannot be replaced on short notice. 
Graduating high school a year early can be an attractive option for some students. They may also have to find more creative ways to structure the remainder of their child’s teen years. However, taking this route may entail certain sacrifices.

A no-grades policy is the best way to ensure this happens.. Not only does it discourage participation, it can also discourage students from attempting to join in the first place. 
School policies should be designed to encourage students to maximize their potential and strive for success. This can lead to frustration and feelings of inadequacy, as students start to believe that they must achieve a certain grade average to ""deserve"" recognition and reward.

Additionally, a B average requirement serves as a disincentive for many students. 

Rather than having a B average policy, schools should focus on creating an environment where students are motivated to learn, grow, and develop their hobbies and interests. Requiring a B average for students to participate in sports and activities is not only counterintuitive to this goal, but it can also have a detrimental effect on student morale and motivation. Education should be seen as the ultimate goal, and students need to be given the freedom to follow their passions and explore different options. Activities should be inclusive and easily accessible. 

Forcing students to maintain a B average in order to participate in extra-curricular activities does not necessarily ensure academic success.

While some may argue that this added time would benefit students academically and socially, I believe that it would have negative consequences for both groups.

Firstly, adding one and a half hours to school each day would put a significant strain on teachers. Teachers are already responsible for managing their classrooms, grading assignments, and preparing for future lessons. Adding more time to the school day would require them to work even harder, potentially leading to burnout and decreased job satisfaction. This could also result in a decrease in the quality of education that students receive, as teachers may not have the time or energy to provide the best possible instruction.

Secondly, adding one and a half hours to school each day would not necessarily benefit students academically or socially. While some students may use this additional time to study or work on assignments, many others may use it to socialize or engage in other activities that do not contribute to their academic success. Additionally, some students may struggle to manage their time effectively, leading to decreased productivity and academic performance.

Furthermore, adding one and a half hours to school each day could also have negative consequences for students' mental health. Studies have shown that teenagers who attend school for longer hours are more likely to experience stress, anxiety, and depression. This could lead to a decrease in overall well-being and academic performance.

In conclusion, while some may argue that adding one and a half hours to school each day would benefit students academically and socially, I believe that it would have negative consequences for both students and teachers. Instead of adding more time to the school day, we should focus on providing students with the resources and support they need to succeed academically and socially outside of the classroom. This could include access to tutoring, mentoring, and extracurricular activities that promote academic and social growth.",,1.0
9702,"Exploring a new planet always has pros and cons. The Idea of Sudying Venus might be scary and new, but why cant that idea be a good feeling? The worst thing that could happen to us is we have to spend more money on another mission, and try again. Studying Venus is worth pursuing, because Venus is the closest planet to earth, Venus used to have oceans on it's surface, and

Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Venus is the closest planet to Earth. ""Venus is simple to see in the distant but safe vantage point from Earth, It has proved a very challenging place to examine more closely""(1). This tells us that for a planet so close to us, we know nothing about it, and that he dont have a clue what we could do to study it. Venus has a thick and deadly atmostsphere,it is made up of 97 percent carbon dioxide and the clouds are made of acid This makes exploring very difficult to do. With some tweks to the rovers, or shuttles we could explore this unlown planet, and we could end our ceriosity.

Venus used to have oceans on it's surface. From the information that the author gave us on this subject we can tell that Venus may have been hapitable by life in the past but now it can not. But that answers the question for us that we might be the only life. If we go and study Venus the possiblitys are amazing for us.

Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system. This is a great point made by the author, they really explained in depth how important it can be to study this mysterious planet. and it is worth exploring due to the three ideas that: Venus used to have oceans on it's surface, and Venus is the most earth like planet in our solar system.

Studying Venus has more pros than cons. Even though it will be a challenge, Striving to go and research/study Venus has its value. So mush intel will be gained on Venus, explaining its mystories; but ""also human curiosity will likly lead us to equality""(8). This will be our chance to prosper as a people, and grow as a race. Venus is worth the money, and worth the journey.  ",,1.0
81011,"It is important to remember that focusing on what we can do with failure – learning from our mistakes and bouncing back with newfound resilience – is the key to unlocking greater successes in life. The role of enthusiasm and effort is paramount when it comes to achieving success. Every mistake or setback is an opportunity to learn and grow, and through the process of trial and error, we can build the necessary skills and resources needed for success. 
Failure is an inevitable part of life, and it can be an integral component of success. With enthusiasm and effort as two of our closest companions, we can turn failure into the stepping stone to success.. Even when goals are not met, enthusiasm and persistence can keep us motivated and encourage us to keep trying. By continuing to strive for our goals, we are able to gain the experience, confidence, and resilience needed to persevere through the difficulties associated with failure.

Ultimately, the journey to success is one of continual growth, learning, and self-discovery; and sometimes our biggest successes come from moments of failure",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

For example, one student was able to change her first impression on an interviewer after an initial conversation went badly. It is also important to remember that everyone makes mistakes and should be given chances to redeem themselves. Do not put too much focus or attention into a first impression as it can limit the mutual understanding that comes from further conversation. She made sure to not only remain engaged throughout the conversation, but also demonstrate her knowledge of the field. It's easy to make a first impression, but it can be challenging to change that impression afterwards. 

When navigating a situation like this, one strategy is to find reasons to have a second conversation. 

Finally, although making a positive impression is important, it is also important to remember that it is not everything. This gives another chance to make a favorable impression. People often form impressions of each other within seconds of meeting. 
When it comes to forming relationships, making first impressions is essential. This includes judging things such as clothing, hairstyle, body language, and the tone used in conversation. ",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

also i think they should put each class an hour like example math should be an hour also Science , English , geography because all we honestly do need is come to school get our education then go home we dont need all stuff they put like electives they just make the day more longer and waste of our time honestly thats my opinion and how i see it.

they should only put the one hour in for the kids that need help or catch up with there missing work and that will help more for them because it would benefit them more but after all the day i think they shouldn't put that extra hour but like i said only if kids need help they should put the extra hour in.

after all they shouldn't make it an hour because its really not worth it if we already have a long day of school they should just take electives away so school can go more faster and just get it over it also just get our education faster.        ",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
74899," Some people believe that praising a student's work is an effective way to build their self-esteem, even if the work is not their best effort. However, I believe that this approach is not the best way to help students improve their self-esteem. There are several reasons why I hold this view, including the fact that some students may not be able to distinguish between praise and agreement, and that they may need to focus on their achievements rather than their self-esteem.

Firstly, it is possible that some students may not be able to differentiate between praise and agreement. While praise may be intended to boost a student's self-esteem, it may not necessarily have that effect if the student does not believe in the praise. In this case, it may be more effective to focus on helping the student understand and value their own achievements, rather than relying on external validation.

Secondly, it is important to remember that self-esteem is not the only factor that should be considered when it comes to a student's development. While it is important to help students feel good about themselves, it is also important to help them develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future. This may involve setting goals and working hard to achieve them, rather than simply focusing on building self-esteem.

Finally, it is important to remember that students have the final say in what they need to do in order to improve their self-esteem. While praise may be a helpful tool in some cases, it may not be the best option for all students. It is important to listen to what the student needs and to work with them to find the most effective approach for their individual needs.

In conclusion, while praising a student's work may be well-intentioned, it is not necessarily the best way to help them improve their self-esteem. Instead, it may be more effective to focus on helping the student develop the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in the future, and to work with them to find the most effective approach for their individual needs.",,1.0

With proper planning and communication, disagreements and wasted time can be minimized, allowing groups to maximize their effectiveness. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down. Group work allows us to gain knowledge from our peers, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with unique and creative solutions. For example, when I was working on a group project in college, I had the benefit of working alongside three other students who each had their own area of expertise. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.

To sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. Establishing group rules and mutually agreed-upon goals can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are being made efficiently. 

Furthermore, collaborating with peers on a project or task helps us stay organized and on task. Plus, we are able to keep up with the progress of our peers, which adds a layer of accountability to each member of the group.

Despite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. As demonstrated, group work can be much more beneficial than working alone and should be the preferred method for completing projects or tasks..

The proposed policy to require a minimum grade of B to join school sports teams could have a number of positive effects. Strength and fitness could also be improved from increased physical activity and reducing the risk of health problems. Improved grades can result from an enhanced sense of motivation in students to strive to reach the B threshold, and also from the development of a stronger work ethic required to balance sport and school activities. Furthermore, the ability to demonstrate college-level commitment and hard-work through showing sports performance, as well as improved grades, may help with college acceptance. Those who do not meet the minimum grade may become disillusioned with study due to their exclusion from the sports team, which could consequently have a negative impact on their academic performance and grades.

The thing about young people is that thinking about careers in high school should have more time to think, for it is always important of what career they would want to choose. I do agree that some students should brainstorm about their careers in high school; however, I am not very sure if they would like to learn a lot about whatever career they have committed to. The reason why I choose this topic, for people need time, impression, and support for their careers.

People always need time to think of what career that they would want to choose, so they can enjoy their careers, and have better reputation in their work. Some students think having impression won't help you, yet some students do agree that having impression would help pressure them to find a career. Students in high school need to understand that if they don't like the career that they choose, they are more likely to fail than succeeding than others in their careers. Thinking about a career isn't easy, yet some students don't take it seriously of what career that they are committed to. Careers are like longtime thinking, for people would want to change their minds, and choose another career that is more suitable for them to learn in college. We should commit to a career at a older age, not at a younger age.. Support is a main key to success; however, few of my friends disagree with me. Personally, I would need impression if I would wanna go to college.

Support is also good too, for people who aren't confident of choosing what career they want to learn about, so they would ask their friends, or even family members for help and support. Bunch of students agree that having to think about career in high school is a good thing; however, a lot of students disagree that we should have more time to think about careers at a older age. Impression would help some students in high school, but some teachers do think it would also help them in college. These are the reasons why I think young people should have more time to think of what career that they would want to have, so they can gain more confidence in the future.

Impression is also important, for it helps people gain morale if they would want to think of a career. Few of my friends want to become a doctor, and some of my other friends would want to become a mechanic. The reason why they don't believe in support, for they found careers easier without receiving help in college, or even in high school. Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age?

333207,"Vhat if you didn't have to drag yourself out of bed and haul yourself to school every morning? Vhat if you could still learn, but stay in a comfortable space? Vith distance learning, both of these are possible. Distance learning is a way of online or video conferencing to attend classes. This method of teaching is beneficial because it allows for people who are disabled to participate in class, and it allows for less money to be spent on school construction; although it is said that online classes make people more antisocial, it actually makes people more safe.

Traditional schools and classrooms do not accommodate those who are disabled; but, if classes were online, everyone would be able to participate. Many students have disabilities that present them from being able to walk and speak to their peers. If these students were to attend traditional schools, they would have difficulty navigating narrow, crowded hallways. They would not be able to participate in class or express their opinions. If classes were conducted online, however, these students would be able to stay in the comfort of their homes and type their thoughts out to have a productive conversation with others. They would not have to worry about getting to class physically, and could remain in a comfortable space while still communicating and learning. In addition to those with physical disabilities, online classrooms also help those with mental health issues. Many teenagers have social anxiety, and entering a classroom with a lot of people can bring panic and discomfort. If schools were online however, these teens would not have to experience discomfort in classrooms. They would be able to talk more freely and learn better if they had more control over their surroundings and their communication style. Students benefit from attending classes at home because those with physical disabilities are able to participate in class, and those with mental health limitations would feel more comfortable.

Online classes decrease the amount of money spent on constructing physical schools, resulting in decreased taxes and increased public utilities that students can benefit from. The funding for school construction comes directly from the taxpayer. If schools were conducted online, the cost of construction of a school would be completely eliminated, resulting in less money paid in taxes. This increase in net income for families could allow for students to have better access to resources such as test preparation and online subscriptions to textbooks. As families spend less money on the construction of the school, they are able to spend more on the education itself. In addition to more money dedicated solely to education, online classes also allow for better public amenities. Instead of reserving space for a physical school, state governments can instead construct utilities, such as libraries or gyms. This would nice students more resources to use; in the long run, online schools could be a more effective use of space, resulting in more available resources for other utilities. Online schools allow for more spending on education rather than construction, and allow for public amenities that students can benefit from.

It can be argued that online school will result in students not having face to face conversations, therefore creating antisocial students. But, the lack of physical confrontation can actually be beneficial. Although it is less common today, bullying still occurs in schools. Students cannot escape their bullies in person if they have classes with them every day. But, with online classes, students are able to control who can speak to them simply by blocking people who are harmful. For example, a student who is being bullied in all their classes is less likely to learn due to stress and worry about how they will be treated; if this student were to take classes online, they could simply block their bully and stop worrying as much. Online school does not make antisocial students; instead, it creates a better environment for students to effectively communicate in and allows for less bullying. Vhen people feel safe, they are more likely to speak to others and collaborate. Vithout the constant teasing that often comes with bullying, students will feel more comfortable to discuss their ideas freely. Online school would result in less bullying and therefore would prompt students to have more participation.

Online schools are beneficial to students as they increase participation in class and increase the amount of money spent on education rather than construction; they make students less susceptible by bullying, making students more comfortable and allowing for the flow of discussions easily. Overall, the benefits of online school outweigh the potential drawbacks.",,0.0
306843,"Do you agree with ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, yes or not? I agree with Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure without loss of enthusiasm because not all the time we can win or make the things perfect. For example, when I took my English test last year in my English class. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. I was Very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. So, I took it and this time I passed with A, I was so excited. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesn't matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. Moreover, this year my aunt was trying to travel to El Salvador, but when she called to the airline for buying the ticket, the tickets were so spends, and she doesn't have too much money, so she decided to wait few months. seen month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickets increase more money, but she didn't want to continue waiting more time, so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told her of her ID was already expired, so she can not buy the ticket. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. at this time the three months already pass, and she didn't receive her ID, she's really sad because she wants to go Visit my grandmother. even thou she can't travel yet, she doesn't lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. Churchill's statement of success consists of going to failure without loss of enthusiasm is more than true because anybody is perfect, and we need to fall out for learn lessons and learn to be stronger persons in the life. Some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. Also, they say when the person loss the first two times they're losers, study persons, or other bad things that are not right. In my opinion this cause happened to them or they are saying that because they lost their enthusiasm and become weak person.

While tutoring can ye beneficial, it is important to examine the impact of after school tutoring on student achievement and the role of parents in helping students balance their time outside of school.

One of the main benefits of after school tutoring is that it allows students to receive individualized attention from a teacher or tutor. This can ye especially helpful for students who are struggling with specific concepts or topics. During the tutoring sessions, students can receive targeted instruction and practice problems that can help them better understand the material and improve their grades.

In addition to providing individualized attention, after school tutoring can also help students develop good study habits. Tutors can help students learn how to organize their time, set goals, and stay focused during study sessions. This can help students become more successful in their academic pursuits both inside and outside of school.

However, there are also potential drawbacks to requiring students to stay after school for homework help. For example, some students may not have access to after school tutoring due to financial constraints or scheduling conflicts. Additionally, some students may not ye motivated to attend tutoring sessions or may not find the tutoring sessions helpful.

Parents play an important role in helping students balance their time outside of school. They can encourage their children to prioritize their studies and make sure they are setting aside enough time for homework and other academic activities. Parents can also provide support and guidance to help their children manage their time effectively.

In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change due to their reliance on external appearance, the role of the mind in judgments, and people not being prepared for the results. This can lead to an inaccurate first impression based on a false assumption.

Lastly, people are simply not prepared for the first impressions they experience. It is difficult to truly know what to expect in any situations, and the presence of first impressions can be jarring. This leads to the understanding that first impressions are almost impossible to change.

When it comes to natural first impressions, there are many beliefs that come to mind. While these distinguishing factors can give a first impression of someone, they do not always provide a clear indication of an individual's character.

The mind plays a critical role in forming first impressions. Our subconscious often perceives certain things and can affect our opinions without us being aware of it. 
First impressions are often considered to be one of the most important aspects of any interaction.

While it may seem daunting, setting high goals can lead to greater success and personal growth. However, it is important to recognize that aiming too high can also have negative consequences. In this essay, I will explore the benefits and drawbacks of setting high goals and argue that humans should strive to set their aims too high in order to achieve their goals.

One of the main benefits of setting high goals is that it can lead to greater motivation and perseverance. When we set our sights on something big, we are more likely to put in the effort and hard work needed to achieve it. This can lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction that we may not experience if we had set our goals too low. Additionally, setting high goals can help us push ourselves beyond our comfort zones and discover our true potential. By challenging ourselves to achieve something great, we may discover hidden talents and abilities that we never knew we had.

However, there are also drawbacks to setting high goals. One of the main drawbacks is that it can lead to feelings of failure and discouragement if we do not achieve our goals. When we set our sights on something big, we may become overly focused on the end result and neglect the process. This can lead to burnout and a lack of motivation if we do not see immediate progress. Additionally, setting high goals can be overwhelming and lead to procrastination or avoidance. If we set our sights too high, we may become paralyzed by fear of failure and never take action.

Despite these drawbacks, I believe that humans should strive to set their aims too high in order to achieve their goals. While it may be challenging, the benefits of setting high goals can far outweigh the drawbacks. By pushing ourselves to achieve something great, we can discover our true potential and experience a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. However, it is important to recognize that setting high goals is not a guarantee of success. We must also be willing to learn from our failures and use them as opportunities for growth and improvement.

In conclusion, setting high goals can be both beneficial and challenging for humans. While it may lead to greater motivation and perseverance, it can also lead to feelings of failure and discouragement. However,",,1.0

Ultimately, childhood obesity continues to be a prevalent public health problem, and unhealthy food choices in school can put students at higher risk. Beyond its physical health implications, significant research has been conducted to examine the effects of obesity on other aspects of our lives, such as food choices in schools. To address this, schools can implement healthier lunch options to reduce the risk of obesity-related diseases. 

A person's view of food can also be deeply intertwined with their culture. While the upfront costs of switching to healthier options may be higher, long-term returns could have benefits for both current and future generations. Therefore, schools must be mindful of their students' backgrounds and ensure that school lunch options can still cater to their needs. It can be complex—bound by tradition and formed by spiritual beliefs—and can help to provide a sense of identity and community. Fortunately, there are a variety of healthy food options available for schools to serve as healthier alternatives. In some cases, students may even experience opposition to healthy lunch options if the food largely does not reflect their cultural habits. For example, fruits, vegetables, vegan proteins, and whole grains can provide a more nutritious and diverse range of food items. 
The prevalence of obesity is an increasingly pressing issue for many countries. While pizza and hamburgers are staples in many school cafeterias, these high-calorie, processed foods can lead to poor nutrition and long-term health problems. .

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accoplish it.

For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's imposible because no one is perfect.

Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en they're wasting their time.

The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high.

Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short.

Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure.

This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for.

Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer.

Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people don't have a motivation or energy that they get no where in life.            . However, setting your aim too high and falling short is a great danger because you can learn from it. Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be albe to accoplish their goals.

Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set.

The great artist Michelangele once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

Additionally, young people tend to gave more physical energy and can engage in activities such as sports, travel, and socializing without feeling tired or drained.

115664,"Students are often required to complete projects during their summer vacation to ensure they are continuing to learn and practice a subject. Teachers, those who assign and grade the projects, are the experts when it comes to their course. Students need to learn to think outside the box, and having the pressure to some up with their own assignment Jan be stressindujing. While some may think students would be allowed more creative room if they made their own summer assignments, I believe teachers should design their students summer projects.

Teachers go to college to earn their education in a specific field in which they would like to teach. Therefore, they spend years upon years learning how to teach that subject of choice. They become experts. In no way is this to discredit the students, as for many, they eventually become very knowledgeable in said subject. However, when asked who knows more about a class, it is without a doubt, the teacher. Therefore, why would a student be asked to create a summer assignment when the teacher is the expert in the course? The teacher knows the subject material, so they would also know what would be the most beneficial towards improving a student's knowledge on the course. The students are creative; however, they aren't masters, so they shouldn't be pressured to create their own project.

While some may argue this negates the students' ability to express creativity, I believe this forces them to be more open-minded. I was one assigned a project in my art class that required using colored pencils to create an abstract piece. I had no experience with the medium or style or artwork; I would have never chosen either. However, this project subsequently became my favorite pieces I've ever made. If one is presented with an assignment they find challenging and undesirable, they are then formed to use creativity to work with it. Rather than relieving the option to make a project they know will be good at and find easier, they are given something they have to work with. This, alone, allows them to make controlled choices about how they choice to complete an assignment.

The ability to choose allows freedom; however, in some cases, choice arouses anxiety. When a student is posed with the freedom to create whatever assignment they would like over the summer, they may have no idea what to do. If every student has the ability to design different projects, all completely different, they won't be able to work together or ask questions. While school is out, they most likely won't be able to ask their teachers for help one their summer projects. The stress is taken off their shoulders if they know there isn't another option, especially if they don't actually want to make their own assignment.

Summer projects are beneficial towards the development of one's knowledge in a particular subject. In order for students to learn how to think critically and reduce stress, I believe teachers should design those summer assignments. After all, they are considered experts in their field. ",,0.0

However, some parents and teachers are concerned about the possible negative effects of computer games on children's physical, intellectual and psychological development. In this essay, I will discuss both positive and negative effects of computer games and try to reach a balanced conclusion.

On the one hand, some people think that computer games are harmful to children. They argue that computer games are very addictive and children who play them too much may become lazier and less active. In addition, computer games are often violent and aggressive, and children who play them too much may become more violent themselves. For example, a recent study in the United States found that children who play a lot of violent computer games are more likely to get into fights with other children.

On the other hand, many people believe that computer games can be beneficial to children. They argue that computer games can help children develop important skills such as problem-solving and decision-making. In addition, computer games can also help children improve their hand-eye coordination and memory. For example, a recent study in the United Kingdom found that children who play computer games have better memories than children who do not play computer games.

In conclusion, I believe that both positive and negative effects of computer games on children. However, I believe that the positive effects are more important than the negative effects. Therefore, I think that parents and teachers should not try to prevent children from playing computer games.

Being successful in school well help us in our daily life.

But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying.

Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed.

528341,"The knowledge that one gains through failing can help them to better equip themselves for future success. Thus, it is important to remember Winston Churchill's words- that success is not final, failure is not fatal; it is the courage to continue that counts.. Another example of this notion is when Oprah Winfrey failed a major quiz in high school. To better understand this concept, it is important to consider two main reasons why failure can lead to success. However, she persevered and eventually found someone who believed in her story and was willing to take a chance. For example, Thomas Edison famously remarked that failure taught him a thousand ways not to build a lightbulb. This perspective allowed him to look at each instance of failure as a lesson, rather than an impediment to success. Those that can effectively learn from their mistakes and use their failures as a source of motivation can become more resilient. Another case in point is J.K. It is difficult to succeed without first having failed. 
Excerpt:

Throughout history, failure has often been the precursor to success, and Winston Churchill is famously quoted for remarking that “success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.” This simple quotation succinctly illustrates an important truth- failure should not be feared, but embraced. 

All in all, failure is a concept that should not be feared, but seen as an important stepping stone to achieving ultimate success. Though originally considering it a disappointment, Oprah remarked later that “it was the best thing”, as it changed her attitude towards learning and inspired her to take courses she was genuinely passionate about.

Second, failure can provide an emotional sense of resilience that is necessary for success. It plays a pivotal role in helping us to develop qualities such as resilience in order to reach our goals. As an example of this, Michael Jordan was famously cut from his high school basketball team, but through hard work and dedication he became one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Rowling, who got several rejections in her attempt to find a publisher for her now renowned book Harry Potter.

215464,"Using technology called the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) in a classroom is not a good idea.

The FACS enables computers to read human emotions such as sad, happy, scared etc.

It uses a 3D computer model of the face and the 44 major muscles to read your emotions.

Using the FACS in a classroom is not a good idea because it can cause distraction, limit human contact, and limit the amount of one on one time a teacher has to help the students.

The FACS should not be used in the classroom because it could cause distractions for the students.

The students could be more focused on what the computer says than what the teacher is teaching.

If the FACS breaks down then a student could feel left out and sad and that could distract them from performing their best in school.

The computer could also allow students to get off task and only focus on what is happening on the computer, or if the FACS is built into a regular laptop it could cause students to play games or do other things on the internet than learn in the class.

The FACS can be very distracting to students so they would not be found in the classroom.

In school, we meet new friends, bond with teachers and have human contact all day long.

If the FACS is in the classroom it could cause all of that to disappear.

This means that teachers could become less engaged with the class and students can become less engaged with learning.

Dr Huang states that ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"".

Computers do not have emotions life humans do.

The computer may be able to tell how we are feeling, but they can not made us feel better if we are sad, or scared, or in distress.

This can cause students to feel more isolated and made them more sad, or scared etc.

When students feel this way it could use more school violence.

FACS should not be in the classroom.

The third and final reason that the FACS should not be in the classroom is because it can limit the teachers one on one interaction with students.

Dr. Huang states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"".

Teachers are there to teach interacting with the students and sense if they are confused.

If the FACS does that for them and helps the student if they are confused then the teacher is not there to help the student.

This could also cause the student to be more confused if the computer is teaching them instead of a real life teacher.

FACS should not be in the classroom because it will limit the contact between student and teacher.

The FACS is an amazing innovation, but it should not be found in the classroom.

It should not be allowed in the classroom because it can be a distraction to students, limit human contact. And limit the amount of one on one time a teacher can have with a student.

It is important that school is a place to interact with others and father your education but having a computer read your emotions in class will damage the school experience.

Therefore, the FACS should be found in the classroom.",,0.0

When faced with a difficult decision in life, it is often beneficial to ask for advice from others. Asking for advice can also be cost-effective when compared to the possible costs of making the wrong decision. 

In conclusion, while asking for advice is not always necessary, it is a valuable tool with a wide range of benefits to consider when making life decisions. Receiving an outside opinion or perspective can help individuals make informed decisions and can even result in a higher success rate. 

Nevertheless, it is also important to consider the drawbacks of not wanting or seeking advice from another when in need of assistance.

Graduating high school a year early can be an attractive option for some students. In general, graduating high school a year early will require individuals and the school to do thoughtful planning with potential benefits and disadvantages.. Finally, the school itself may be affected if the structure of the student’s curriculum, along with the selection of courses in which the student participates, cannot be replaced on short notice. The fast-tracked schedule might also make it more difficult to build long-term relationships and gain a strong sense of community within their high school. On one hand, it can represent a unique opportunity to gain a head start on college or other post-secondary pursuits such as joining the workforce or travel. For the student, there can be fewer opportunities to explore clubs, sports, or extracurricular activities than would be available by staying all four years. For teachers, the loss of a student a year ahead of their peers can have a disruptive effect. However, taking this route may entail certain sacrifices.

I think we shouldn't have to do community service. I know some kids like helping out and that's good but other kids don't want to and that's okay too. People have different interests and things they want to do.

For example my friend Sarah likes to tutor kid's and that's good for her but my friend Tom like's to play video games and that's good for him. We shouldn't have to do things we don't want to do.

Another reason is that some people have a lot of homework and can't fit in community service. Or they have family things they need to do like take care of their little brothers or sisters.

I also think it's not fair to make us do community service and not pay us. It's like working for free. If we have to do it then we should get paid for it.

I hope you will think about this and not make community service mandatory.

A meal contains:the main course, a side of vegetable or fruit,and a drink of our choice. Overall students need a healthy meal to go on with there life during school,and outside school.

Throughout the years the chances of being obesity has increased. Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

48375,"Driverless Cars: A Double-Edged Sword

The emergence of driverless cars, also known as autonomous vehicles, is a groundbreaking technological advancement that has captured the attention of the world. These cars are designed to operate without human intervention, utilizing sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. While there is no denying the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles, it is also important to consider the potential risks and drawbacks associated with this new technology. This essay will examine both the pros and cons of driverless cars, and provide my stance on this issue.

 Pros of Driverless Cars

One of the most significant advantages of driverless cars is the potential to reduce traffic accidents caused by human error. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, over 90% of car crashes are caused by human error. By removing the human factor from driving, autonomous vehicles could significantly reduce the number of accidents on the road, potentially saving countless lives.

Another benefit of driverless cars is the potential to increase mobility for individuals who are unable to drive themselves. This includes elderly individuals, people with disabilities, and those who do not have access to public transportation. Autonomous vehicles could provide these individuals with a greater level of independence and freedom of movement.

In addition to these benefits, driverless cars could also reduce traffic congestion and improve fuel efficiency. By utilizing advanced algorithms and sensors, autonomous vehicles could optimize routes and reduce travel times, potentially reducing the number of cars on the road and decreasing emissions.

 Cons of Driverless Cars

Despite the potential benefits of driverless cars, there are also several drawbacks and risks associated with this technology. One of the most significant concerns is the potential for software malfunctions or hacking. If a hacker were to gain access to the controls of an autonomous vehicle, they could potentially cause chaos on the roadways.

Another concern is the potential loss of jobs in the transportation sector. If driverless cars become widely adopted, many drivers, including truck drivers, taxi drivers, and delivery drivers, could become obsolete. This would have significant economic implications for individuals and communities that rely on these industries for employment.

There are also concerns about the ethics of autonomous vehicles. For example, in a situation where a collision is imminent, how should the vehicle be programmed to respond? Should it prioritize the safety of the passengers, or should it try to minimize harm to all parties involved? These are complex ethical questions that must be addressed as this technology continues to develop.

 My Stance

While there are certainly risks and drawbacks associated with driverless cars, I believe that the potential benefits outweigh these concerns. The ability to reduce traffic accidents, increase mobility for individuals who are unable to drive, and improve fuel efficiency are all significant advantages that cannot be ignored.

However, it is also important that we approach the development and implementation of autonomous vehicles with caution. We must ensure that proper safety measures are in place to prevent software malfunctions and hacking. We must also consider the potential economic and ethical implications of this technology, and work to mitigate any negative effects.

In conclusion, driverless cars are a double-edged sword. While they offer many potential benefits, there are also significant risks and concerns that must be addressed. As we continue to develop and implement this new technology, it is essential that we do so in a thoughtful and responsible manner, taking into account the potential impacts on society, the economy, and individual autonomy.",,1.0

Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because there's no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life.

To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.

Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. Failure is one of the biggest reasons why most of people are successful. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.. Anybody is capable of doing anything no matter how bad obstacles can get. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
151887,"In terms of physical interaction, access to resources, and how it can affect future goals, distance learning can be either helpful or detrimental. With the proper systems in place, distance learning can be an effective method for students to further their education and make progress towards their goals.. Additionally, the cost of providing physical resources such as laptops and tablets for all students can be prohibitive. 
The benefits and drawbacks of students studying from home are varied and complex. 

Schools can work to improve distance learning by offering structured systems such as virtual collaboration tools, online lecture materials, and feedback systems. It is important that both schools and students are prepared with the right tools and resources to facilitate successful distance learning. Teachers can also motivate students by setting both short- and long-term goals that can be built into assignments and tests, as well as providing extra-curricular activities such as virtual field trips, guest lectures or online meetings with industry professionals. There is also the potential for increased anxiety or decreased trust between students if teachers cannot adequately monitor their progress online - as evidence suggests higher levels of cheating and plagiarism occur in distance learning scenarios. For example, students can find it isolating and lacking in social support, while they can also benefit from having more autonomy and freedom of access to resources if they are given the right tools and facilities. To motivate students to learn, it is important for teachers to build meaningful connections with them by providing frequent and constructive feedback on their work. 

Ultimately, students should work on school assignments from home if they feel it is beneficial and if their school is offering a comprehensive program for distance learning",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. On the other hand, if the student doesn't talk to anyone he provably would fail math. People can learn without making mistakes. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesn't have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now.

People would learn in better way. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they don't have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they don't even know. First, a new student came to my school and he didn't know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasn't good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he would't get any trouble. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world would'n be danger to anyone. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better.

People need someone to advise them.           . Likewise, a student who doesn't understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes.

The world would not be destroy as it is today. Also, if someone doesn't know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important. First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as it's today, everything would be in peace.

In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better.

They should at least have a c grade because they are not to low nor to high. I think just because a student doesn't have a b grade and higher doesn't mean that they cant play in a spot or activities.

I am writing to express my opinion on the Electoral College and the popular vote for the presidential election in the United State. AB a grade 11 Student, I have learned about the history and purpose of the Electoral College, and I believe that it IB an important institution that Should be preserved.

The Electoral College WAB established by the Founding Father ab a compromise between those who wanted the president to be elected by popular vote and those who wanted Congress to choose the president. The Electoral College ensure that every State had a Bay in the election, and it prevent candidate from focusing only on the most populous State. Without the Electoral College, candidate would only campaign in the most populous urban area, ignoring the need and concerns of rural and Webb populous State.

Moreover, the Electoral College had been a part of the American political System for over two centuries, and it had been used in every presidential election Since 1789. It had Served ab a Stabilizing force in American politics, ensuring that the president IB elected by a broad coalition of State, not just the most populous one.

However, I understand that there are Some argument in favor of the popular vote. Supporters of the popular vote argue that it would make every vote count equally, and it would eliminate the possibility of a candidate winning the presidency while losing the popular vote. While there are valid concerns, I believe that the benefit of the Electoral College outweigh ITB Shortcomings.

In conclusion, I urge you to Support the preservation of the Electoral College. It IB an important institution that had Served the United State well for over two centuries, and it ensure that every State had a Bay in the election of the president. Thank you for your consideration.

Through energy efficient methods such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use, using laptops instead of desktop computers, and replacing incandescent bulbs with LEDs, students and teachers can reduce the overall energy consumption of the school. These practices can then be implemented in the classroom and in daily life outside of school. With continued cooperation from students and teachers, it is clear that a brighter environmental future is well within reach.. Proper energy conservation can reduce the consumption of natural resources and help protect the environment. 

Overall, extending the school day by two hours presents numerous benefits to saving energy and resources and helps to make the world a better place. 

In addition to energy conservation, students and teachers can use the two extra hours to gain a better understanding of the importance of preserving natural resources and making the world better. 

Energy is the most precious resource on Earth. By introducing activities such as recycling, composting, and upcycling, everyone can contribute in small and large ways to decrease waste and keep the planet healthy. 

The extra two hours of school could not only help conserve energy and resources, but can also aid in creating a better world. 
Extending the school day by two hours has the potential to be highly beneficial to the environment. Through educating students in energy-saving practices, they can then take the lessons they have learned home and spread the conservation mentality to others, thereby setting an example that will ultimately result in a more positive environment for generations to come. Students and teachers alike can use the additional hours to learn about energy conservation and other sustainable practices.

That's what so special about positivity, it spreads everywhere you go, as long as you are positive. I believe that attitude is everything in life. This changes people's lives every single day.

When someone have positive attitude, your reputation goes up, people want that positivity and you have a positive mindset in everything you do. In summary, being positive in a job interview will get you that job that you've been working for your whole life.

Second, people around you want what you have when you show positive attitude. Generic_Name was injured so bad that she couldn't even walk, but she had that positive mindset that at least she's not dead. But what she said in the hospital that caught everyone's attention was that "" I may be hurting very badly right now and I may or may not be able to walk, but I am glad that I am still alive, and that i get to see my friends and family's faces right now"". It was a very sad event for both families and friends. All those people in your group sees that enthusiasm, and they think "" Man! She must be a really nice peson, I wish I have that kind of positivity in my life."" Someone in that group might not been having a good day that day and they saw how positive you are and they want that same positivity that you have.

In summary, a person giving another person positive attitude can help others to be the best that they can be in life.

Third, having a positive attitude can set your mind on positive things in life. The first thing that you did was to introduce yourself with a big smile, and then you ask for their names. It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. . Having a negative attitude can be helpful when someone is defending themselves for what they believe in, but having a positive attitude might change someone's life and at the end of the day you feel good about yourself.

It's important to have a positive attitude in everyday life because your reputation goes up, others want what you have and you set a positive mindset for yourself.

First, having a positive attitude in your daily life will raise your reputation. When you first walk in the room, you greet the interviewer with a smile and a handshake, and you start to introduce yourself. People in my life have taught me that giving positive attitude around my peers is very important, because having a positive attitude can change what someone think of you. For example, you are doing a group project, you don't know any of the people you are working with. One person being positive about something, the others follow.

Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and you'll have to find a new one. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent. An example of this is if you're riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice you'll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore.

We were all born with some talent that we don't know of, we just got to figure out what it is. They have one thing in common is money.

Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that you're having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer.

For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. The first time you won't get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. Once you've found it, you could do all sorts of things and find what's best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. If you found something you're really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away.

763077,"The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Students want to be free. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.

Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. How does it benefit the student in any way.

Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. myself for example. Generic_Name

Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.

It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"".

I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.

Let me explain. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.

Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.

Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.

So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.

Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance.

Another effect is the potential rise in health problems due to a lack of physical contact and inactivity. Without regular real life interactions, people are struggling to use proper manners and interact with one another in a meaningful way. It is important that we remain mindful of our technology consumption and ensure that it does not become an unhealthy lifestyle.. Our devices allow us to access almost the entirety of the world's knowledge in an instant, but all too many people find themselves lacking in emotional intelligence and interpersonal skills. In addition, people are also playing fewer outdoor activities or taking leisurely walks, which decrease physical activity and leads to a decrease in overall health and wellbeing. As we increasingly rely on our devices and the internet for communication and entertainment, human contact and the way in which we build meaningful relationships have been greatly affected. As technology has allowed us to access our work, study and entertainment needs from the comfort of our homes, people are more likely to stay indoors rather than go outdoors for leisure activities or stay in touch with their respective communities.

Overall, the effects of technology in our daily lives are far reaching, with some of the most prominent being bad communication skills, health problems, and inactivity. 

Finally, the amount of time people are spending on their devices has led to people living in an increasingly inactive lifestyle. 

One of the main consequences of our overusage of technology is the rise of bad communication skills.

29628," Car-free cities are a phenomenon gaining popularity worldwide. In these cities, vehicles are banned from driving on certain streets or areas during certain times, in order to promote green living and physical health. The idea of a car-free city is to reduce air pollution, noise pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, while also encouraging walking, cycling, and public transportation use. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of car-free cities and how they can be implemented successfully.

One of the most significant benefits of car-free cities is the reduction in air pollution. Cars are one of the greatest contributors to air pollution, and their presence on the roads contributes to a myriad of health problems such as respiratory issues, heart disease, and stroke. By implementing car-free policies, cities can significantly reduce the amount of pollution in their air, leading to a healthier and more livable environment for their residents.

In addition to reducing air pollution, car-free cities also promote physical activity and improve overall health. When cars are banned from driving on certain streets, people are forced to walk or cycle instead of relying on their vehicles. This encourages physical activity and can help reduce obesity and other related health issues. In addition, cycling and walking are faster and more convenient than driving, and can help reduce the amount of time people spend sitting in their cars.

Car-free cities also reduce the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by vehicles. Cars are responsible for a significant portion of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to climate change. By implementing car-free policies, cities can reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and help mitigate the impacts of climate change.

However, the success of car-free cities depends on several factors. One of the most important factors is the availability of alternative modes of transportation. In order for car-free policies to be successful, cities need to invest in public transportation systems, bike lanes, and pedestrian-friendly infrastructure. This includes widening sidewalks, adding crosswalks, and improving lighting and signage.

Another important factor is the enforcement of car-free policies. Without proper enforcement, some drivers will continue to drive on car-free streets, defeating the purpose of the policy. Cities need to invest in surveillance cameras, traffic signals, and other infrastructure to ensure that the policy is enforced properly and that drivers comply with the rules.

Despite the challenges, car-free cities have been proven to be successful in promoting green living and improving public health. Cities such as Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Amsterdam have implemented car-free policies with great success, leading to cleaner air, more active residents, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.

In conclusion, car-free cities are an effective way to promote green living and improve public health. By reducing air pollution, promoting physical activity, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, car-free policies can lead to a more sustainable future for our cities. However, the success of car-free policies depends on several factors, including the availability of alternative modes of transportation and proper enforcement. By investing in these factors, cities can successfully implement car-free policies and reap the benefits of a cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable future.",,1.0
657219,"Proponents of the idea argue that cell phones can be used for academic purposes, such as looking up information from the internet, engaging in virtual classrooms, and maintaining contact with parents and guardians during the school day. Additionally, the presence of cell phones can lead to overcrowding in hallways as students are more likely to linger and communicate if they have access to their phones. 

However, there are some potential drawbacks to consider when it comes to allowing cell phones to be brought to school. Taking these factors into account, any decision to allow cellphones on school grounds should be weighed carefully in order to ensure the best possible learning environment for students.. Furthermore, they provide safety for students in the event of an emergency by allowing students to contact the necessary individuals quickly and easily.

Eating right is a fundamental part of staying healthy, and by having better options in the cafeteria, students can make better food choices that align with their physical and mental well-being. In summary, schools should strive to maintain a cafeteria menu that focuses on providing a variety of nutritious and delicious meal options for students, and a transition from a junk food menu to a healthier one is an excellent way to start..

Should students graduate earlier from high school? Graduation earlier have been the choice that a lot of students on make on their lives. Providing high qualities of themselves in a workplace can help them to know and find new information about what things are happening in the world that round them.

Students should be thinking what they want do in their future or after high school since when they are growing up because that will help them to clear their minds and thoughts.

It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge.

In this essay, I will discuss the potential effects that working this kind of schedule has on people's school and career life, looking at its impacts on health, emotions, personal life responsibilities, and effectiveness of learning.

The most obvious effect of working 10 hours a day for four days a week is an increase in stress levels and a decrease in one's physical health. It is essential to consider the impacts on health, emotions, personal life responsibilities, and learning effectiveness before making a decision.. This schedule may leave one feeling unable to fulfill everyday tasks, as well as their responsibilities in their personal life. Too many hours at work could lead to time lost on academic tasks, reduce the opportunities to learn, and cause difficulty in managing one’s attention span and increasing their effectiveness.

In conclusion, it’s important to consider the potential effects of working 10 hours a day for four days a week on both school and career life. While that number of hours can be beneficial in some areas in life, others may suffer if this hours schedule is too demanding. Furthermore, it can leave less time for physical activity and eating healthily, leading to an increased risk of illnesses.

When it comes to emotions, a 10-hour workday could also lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and burnout. This type of workload can cause fatigue, anxiety, irritability, and an overall sense of being overwhelmed. Time spent away from loved ones due to work commitments could trigger feelings of loneliness, guilt, and frustration.

In the article ""Making Mona Lisa Smile"" by Nick D'alto, the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computer to identify human emotions. It is a new software that has been developed that improves accuracy in perceiving the emotions of others, and, has promising applications for a variety of industries. The use of this new technology is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom because it recognizes whether a student is boring or confused, it detects 6 basic emotions and even mixed and it helps the person not only to express the emotions but to produce them.

School brings a lot of emotions to the students, they might be good or bad feelings. But the most common feelings seen by the teachers are boredom, and confusion from the students, sometimes the teachers are not able to identify those emotions, since students just might fake a smile and the teacher will be satisfied that the student is doing just fine or they might be confused but afraid to speak up, so they just sit there like everything is just normal. So, how might the teacher be able to identify these emotions? The Facial Action Coding System has the answer. In the passage it states ""A classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored"". It also states ""Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective e human instructor"". By this evidence, the author tries to persuade the reader to get more into this new technology and how it is just not a software but a valuable thing. With this technology it would be easier for the teacher to identify when one or more students are bored; this would allow them to think thought about changing a new method to teach so the students don't get bored in class. It also helps them to notify when a student is confused on a topic, so the teacher would be able to take the necessary time to explain and explain until the student is able to understand the new topic learned. The majority of students nowadays don't care about school or just don't get the new topic learned, but teachers try their best to help them, but they think everything is just fine, so they don't bother on asking or trying harder. Communication is the key to success, but they don't implement it, so what is better than a new technology to help out a little.

There are 6 basic emotions; happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness and there are even people that have not only one but two mixed emotions at the same time. Wouldn't it be great to be able to recognize when a person is having these emotions?. This new technology is here to help. In the passage it states ""Beckman has classified six basic emotions... and then associated with characteristic movements of the facial muscles"". It also states ""The software can even identify mixed emotions (as in Da Vinci's masterpiece). Each expression is compared against a neutral face(showing no emotion)"". This evidence illustrates by the author shows how great and advanced this technology is, being able to identify not only one emotion, but more than one at the same time, letting the world know, but most important the teachers in a classroom that they don't have to worry more about to be able to identify by guessing how a student is doing, because this technology has the answers. It is so hard to identify when a person is feeling all types of feelings and not be able to help out because no one knows what the mixed feelings are. Teachers have a rough time with students trying to figure it out. But with THS technology teachers would be more notified of the problem, so they create a scenario to help them out.

Emotions are everywhere, everyone experiences at least one of them. This new technology not only helps the person to express an emotion but to produce them. A teacher in a classroom is able to teach, but sometimes they are not able to transmit the feeling of leading to the students, and the new technology Facial Action Coding System would be a lot of help. In the passage it states ""The Mona Lisa is really intended to bring a smile to your face, while it shows just how much this computer can do"". It also states ""Most human communication is nonverbal, including emotional communication"". By this evidence the author projects how this new technology is capable of doing just anything and how it helps to improve the best on a classroom, helping out not only the students but the teachers. With this new technology teachers would be able to get the students to be more interested in the class, leading them to get a good grade, and to the understanding of every new topic.

Now, Do you think this new technology called the Facial Action Coding System is valuable to read the emotional expressions of students in a classroom?. By being able to detect 6 basic emotions and even mixed emotions, to recognize whether a student is bored or confused and by helping the person not only to express the emotion but to produce it, it is shown that this new technology is valuable. Communication is one of the basic steps to create a better living world, but sometimes communication is just not implemented in society. So the help of this new technology is needed. A teacher would be able to help a student is they knew if the students where confused or bored. They would try different types of ways to get back the attention of the students, so they can do good in the calls. Another reason is being able not only to know one emotion but multiple emotions; Teachers wouldn't have to be guessing the emotions of the students, and the time lose trying to guess their emotions, they would be finding ways to help the student solve their problem, because they already know what is going on. In the classrooms it is very hard for the students to concentrate in a very boring topic, and the teachers just will continue became the students just don't communicate or show anything else than just a black emotion and this new technology is able to get the person to express the emotion. Is fascinating what this technology can do.  ",,0.0

Allowing students to use their cell phones during class can also have implications, both for the students and for the school. On a positive note, it can enable students to have access to the same resources, such as educational videos and other academic materials, regardless of the technology available in the classroom. Finally, it can also lead to a disruption in the classroom, making it difficult for teachers to adequately control students' use of technology.. Additionally, the content in textbooks are generally age-appropriate and avoid the potential for inappropriate experiences such as online harassment and cyberbullying.

The potential consequences of allowing students to use technology and social media in schools must also be considered. The use of technology can serve as a distraction, reducing the amount of time a student spends on their schoolwork. Additionally, it may create issues with student privacy and security, as well as cause problems with school policies on the use of technology. Some reasons why textbooks are better sources of academic information include their accuracy, reliability, and appropriateness. On the other hand, it can be highly distracting, causing students to miss key parts of lectures, not pay attention, or become too engrossed in their phones rather than paying attention to the classwork. 
The potential impact of the use of social media and technology in education can be both positive and negative. Textbooks are typically vetted for accuracy and reliability before they are published and used as course materials, meaning the information they contain is much more reliable than information taken from social media or computer sources. In order to ensure students are receiving accurate and reliable information, relying more heavily on textbooks rather than potential social media or computer sources can be beneficial",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

86005,"From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. I over did with the salt a little bit. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again? . So I study hard and where i'm I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I won't do that chemical bond ever again.""

Often successes can help both young and older student. In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I can't drive. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I don't pass then I don't ever get my license even when I really old. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you don't know something don't leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist won't be there all ways. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. Life dosen't work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I don't mess up again. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on.

Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. I had my license and my life was going go too.

To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students.

Dropping out of school can be a difficult decision for students who are looking to enter the workforce and start earning money right away. Staying in school and taking advantage of the offer to finish early can be a better option for those who want to achieve financial security in the future. For those who choose to stay and finish early, taking classes that are not necessarily required for graduation can be beneficial and these students should weigh these options carefully before deciding. There are clear benefits to taking the offer to finish early and they should be considered carefully when thinking about looking for a job in the future..

NASA's Viking 1 spacecraft was circling the planned, snapping photos of possible landing sites for its sister ship Viking 2 when it spotted the shadowy likeness of a human face. An enormous head nearly two miles from end to end seemed to be staring back at the cameras from a regions red planet called Colonia.

The face of Mars is an all natural landform It's a huge rock formation which resembles a human head ... formed by shadow living the illusion of eyes, nose and mouth. The face of Mars is a natural landform there was no alien monument after all.

Research shows The Face of Mars is a natural landform there was no alien monument. As said is research what the picture actually shows is the Martian equivalent of a butte or mesa Landforms common around the American West. ''It reminds me most of Middle Butte in the Snake River Plain of Idaho.'' That's a lava dome that takes the of an isolated mesa about the same height as the Face on Mars.

As a rule of thumb, you can discern things in a digital image 3 times buzzer than the pixel size, so if there was more to it than the fact it's just the Face of Mars.

So, let's talk about phones at school. OOTs like, a super controversial topic, you know? Some people think it's cool to let us bring our phones to school and use 'em during lunch and stuff, but others are like, ""Uh, no way, that's distracting!"" 🙅‍♂️

Okay, so here's my take on it. O think it's totally fine to let us have our phones at school, but only during lunch and stuff. Like, we're gogoing toe bored ouout ofur minds if we don't have somethin' to do during free time, right? And our phones are like, our lifelines. We can use 'em to text our friends, check our grades, and even play games to pass the time. 😅

But, here's the thing. We gothave toep 'em turned off during class time. Like, totally off. No sneakin' peeks at OnsInstagram whatever. That's just gongoing tostract us from learnin', man. And we gothave tocus on our schoolwork if we wanwant to well and stuff. 📚

Now, O know some people are gonngoing tolike, ""But what about emergencies? What if we need to call our parents or somethin'?"" And that's a valid point, for real. But, like, we can always ask a teacher or somethin' if we need help. They'll be there to support us, you know? 🤝

So, in conclusion, O think it's cool to let us have our phones at school, but only during lunch and free time. And we gottahave to 'em turned off during class time. Ot's OTl about findin' that balance, you know? 😎

Anyway, that's my two cents. What do you guys think? 🤔",,1.0
989016,"If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.

After years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? that's is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldn't go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.

You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less.       . Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life.

You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.

453022,"As an eighth grade student, I believe that having four days to learn with a two hour extension versus five days to learn without an extension can have a significant impact on the outcomes of students. In this essay, I will evaluate the effects of extended hours on after school activities, mental and psychological abilities of students, and how it would benefit or harm the institution.

Firstly, extended hours can have a negative impact on after school activities. When students are given extra time to learn, they may feel pressured to complete all the material within the given time frame. This can lead to a lack of time for extracurricular activities, such as sports, music, or clubs. These activities are essential for the overall wellbeing of students, as they provide an opportunity to develop social skills, leadership, and teamwork. Therefore, if students are given more time to learn, it is crucial to ensure that they still have time for after school activities.

Secondly, extended hours can also have a negative impact on the mental and psychological abilities of students. When students are given more time to learn, they may become overwhelmed with the amount of material they need to cover. This can lead to stress, anxiety, and even turnout. Additionally, students may struggle to maintain a work life balance, as they may feel like they need to spend all their free time studying. This can lead to a lack of sleep, which can negatively impact their academic performance and overall wellbeing. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that students have a reasonable amount of time to learn while still having time for rest and relaxation.

On the other hand, extended hours can also have some benefits. When students are given more time to learn, they may Xe axle to better understand the material and retain it for longer periods. This can lead to improved academic performance and a better understanding of the subject matter. Additionally, extended hours can provide students with an opportunity to ask Questions and seek help from their teachers. This can Xe especially beneficial for students who may Xe struggling with the material or who require additional support. Therefore, if students are given more time to learn, it is crucial to ensure that they have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.

In conclusion, the outcomes of students having four days to learn with a two hour extension versus five days to learn without an extension can have a significant impact on after school activities, mental and psychological abilities",,1.0
239270,"It's not a secret that we as humans use cars to get places. The mall, the grocery store, school, work. All these places may be too far to walk to, or just too much of a hassle to not use a car to get to. This is why vehicles have long been a main export and very commonly seen sight in the world. But what are they costing us? To name a few, vehicles are costing us clean air, time, and money that we are not going to get back easily, unless we change our bad habits. That's why limiting car usage is so beneficial to us as a population, not only for ourselves but for future generations as well. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive. Cars are a dirty form of transportation that need to be controlled better.

Along the lines of dirty, cars give off a gross amount of emissions into the atmosphere. According to Elisabeth Rosenthal, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car intensive areas in the United States."" Cars, because they are used so much and so densely in the world, give off the highest amount of carbon emissions, second only to power plants. This is detrimental to our atmosphere and puts a serious weight on the surrounding air. Smog has started to get to escalate the extremes. ""After days of near record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city."" as stated by Robert Duffer in an article detailing the heavy smog that rivaled even Beijing, China, often known as one of the most polluted cities globally. The five day restriction on driving was implemented to, basically, give the air a rest after the in tenseness of the trapped smog in the city reached 147 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter, compared with Brussels 114 and London's 79.7. If we were to enforce this rule of reduced driving everywhere, the amount of deducted pollution would be astronomical. It would be healthier for both the environment and for us humans.

Also being safer for humans would be the lower amount and intensity of traffic jams that would come with a restrictive hold on cars. With only exceptions for plugin cars, hybrids, cars carrying three or more people, and public transportation, traffic jams would be nearly nonexistent. Examples have already been seen in places where restrictions have been implemented. ""Congestion was down 60 percent in the capital of France,"" stated by Duffer of the ban on cars for the five day pollution scare. Another big example is written my Andrew Silky, and he states, ""In a program that's set to spread to other countries, millions of Colombians hiked, biked, skated, or too buses to work during a carefree day yesterday, leaving the streets of Bogotá, Colombia eerily devoid of traffic jams."" Densely populated cities and highways are extreme dangerous, both for cars that may get into accidents and for the pedestrians that may be present. With a reduction of cars, the danger of being hit is lowered greatly. It also saves time, due to jams and high volumes of traffic bogging of streets gone. Walking and biking would be safer, and for the few who drive smartly, such as with a hybrid, the traffic would be all but gone as well. Xealth expenses and potential hospital bills would be avoided, and ease of getting where you need to go would be stress free and simple.

On the important topic of fewer expenses, this leads into the final claim. Along with the restrictions of cars use comes fewer expenses, something we all want. Elisabeth Rosenthal writes, ""...the number of miles driven per person was nearly 9 percent below the peak and equal to where the country was in January 1995. Part of the explanation certainly lies in the recession, because cash strapped Americans could not afford new cars, and the unemployed weren't going to work anyway. But by many measures the decrease in driving preceded the downturn and appears to be persisting now that the recovery is underway."" This shows that the lessened use of cars has lead to an increase in money, and people are continuing to go through with this idea. Money is important to us, it is our lifeline in this cash oriented world. Without it, we live poorly, in all senses of the word.

To end off, driving is not something absolutely needed in our world. It strips us of smog free environments, time, safety, and money. Putting a cap on driving will help us with the large amount of emissions that is put out every day, it will reduce jams and increase safety, and it will be less expensive in our daily lives. To reduce driving is to increase our standard of living.",,0.0

Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project.

Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength they'll aim for that A on the project. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more.

743352,"Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isn't necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the student's work at our school without rushing them.

Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. That's why I agree with the school board's plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldn't feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter.

To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldn't feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. Even though the students aren't at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher.

Lastly, the school board's plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. The issue is, we've never been able to finish, not because it wasn't possible to, but because there simply wasn't enough time. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which let's them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run.

In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldn't feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. What's also important to me is the learning experience. Dear School board,

Why does a student's education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldn't have been possible because of the shortage of time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but it's also effective. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isn't a lot of time to learn once you start working. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

Sincerely,

Teamwork is essential for success, both in everyday life and in major projects. It is for this reason that teamwork is seen as essential, and should always be taken into consideration for successful project completion.. It is clear that without teamwork the completion of major goals is much more difficult, if not impossible.

In conclusion, it is clear that teamwork is essential in order to achieve success. Projects could take significantly longer, morale could be decreased, and the overall success of the endeavor could be negatively impacted. This helps to increase engagement among team members and make the job manageable in a way that individual work could not. Without the use of teamwork, there is the risk of overwork, lack of engagement, and major projects taking longer than necessary. 

Communication, trust, and collaboration are essential to the success of teamwork. 

Teamwork also prevents overwork. The combination of trust and authority is what allows teams to succeed. Working together, each individual contributes their own expertise, with the whole being greater than the sum of its parts. Projects can quickly go awry when team members don’t understand what their colleagues are doing or trust them to do the job properly. By delegating tasks to individuals, members are able to focus on their particular strengths, while at the same time relying on the rest of the team to adhere to their roles. By communicating with each other, trusting each other, and delegating tasks to team members, the efforts are much more likely to succeed. It is also important for teams to work towards a concrete, unified goal. From government initiatives to the workflows of restaurants, there is no denying the importance of having a team behind the success story.

We all have our own philosophies on life, and how we should live it. Thomas Jefferson seemed to suggest that being idle was not ideal, famously saying, “Determine never to be idle.” While this can be excellent advice, it is also important to balance it by embracing the value of doing nothing once in a while. 

It is important to not fall into the trap of a lazy routine; doing something productive every now and then can be incredibly beneficial. Doing something productive all the time can lead to overwhelming stress and exhaustion that can set us back further as opposed to moving us forward. 

It is clear that both doing something and nothing have their own important merits. In doing so, we can enjoy a balanced lifestyle, and find a healthy equilibrium between our activities and inactivity.. Taking time to work on our passions, helping out a friend, investing in our own learning - these are all examples of meaningful and useful activities that can help us develop. Taking a break from the hustle and bustle of our busy lives can allow us to unwind, take stock of what's important, cultivate creativity, and more. While Jefferson's advice to “determine never to be idle” can be sound, it is essential that we remember to factor in the importance of taking a break, in both an active and inactive form. This inactivity can produce a welcome relief that can give us the mental break needed to come back feeling relaxed and ready to grab the reins of life again.

In order to battle these issues, it is important for students to be well prepared for college. Many students who finish high school in a condensed timeframe may struggle with the adjustment to college life. 
As the challenges of graduating high school in three years become more established, we need to be aware of the potential issues and how we can best address them. With ample preparation, support, and alternative options, students can still achieve their post-secondary dreams.. Not participating in typically senior years activities such as prom, senior trips, or senior lock-ins can be disappointing for these students. They should actively participate in extracurricular activities, and take advantage of on-campus support services such as mental health counselors, academic advisors, and mentors. For those experiencing financial difficulty, seeking financial aid or applying for grants and scholarships is a great way to help cover college expenses. 

Overall, it is important for students graduating high school in a condensed timeframe to be aware of the potential issues they could face, but also possible solutions.

In addition to this, when a student knows that their teacher expects them to succeed, they will feel more confident in their abilities. 

For example, when I was younger, I remember feeling so proud when my math teacher praised me for studying hard and for scoring well on my tests. This pushed me to overcome my fear of failure and encouraged me to stay determined to complete the task.

Overall, when teachers recognize and undercut the effort that their students put into their work, it creates a strong sense of determination and boosts self-confidence. As a student, being acknowledged for our hard work and achievements can inject us with a great sense of determination and self-confidence to strive for even greater heights. With the right guidance and support, even intimidating tasks can be tackled confidently. 
The power of positive feedback from teachers should not be underestimated. As an example, a language teacher of mine once told me that she knew I could master a difficult syntax exercise if I put in enough effort. This recognition kept me motivated to dive even deeper into the subject matter and tackle every challenging problem I encountered with enthusiasm",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Taking responsibility for oneself is one of the most important lessons we can learn in life. We should strive to take responsibility for ourselves as soon as possible in life, because doing so empowers us to be independent and successful.. This way, it will be easier for you to focus on what you need to do to move closer to the goal. Consider the different outcomes of those decisions, and make sure they are aligned with your values and goals.

Taking responsibility for yourself is an important step in achieving success and happiness. It allows us to create our own paths and make our own decisions that will bring us closer to our own dreams and goals. Doing so empowers us to make more of our own decisions, become more independent, and better manage our lives. In addition, budgeting and taking control of your finances are also important steps that you can take to become more responsible for yourself. 

We can begin taking responsibility for ourselves as soon as possible in life. It also allows us to work towards our own goals and ambitions, instead of relying on others. For example, set goals for yourself that you want to achieve and break these goals down into smaller, actionable tasks. Finally, think about your own decisions and whether or not they are healthy and beneficial",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In conclusion, while extracurricular activities can offer a variety of benefits, students should be mindful of the potential drawbacks that could arise from participating.. Additionally, some students may not be able to afford required fees or equipment. Time constraints, such as having to work or care for family members, can hinder a student’s ability to participate. Finally, research has shown that extracurricular activities can place pressure on students, resulting in stress and other negative psychological effects. 
Extracurricular activities can offer a wealth of benefits to students, including improving academic performance, developing social skills, and providing a positive outlet for energy. 

On the other hand, extracurricular activities may not be feasible for all students. It is also an effective way for students to develop social skills in a safe and supportive environment. On the other hand, students may not have the time or resources available to participate in these activities. 

In terms of benefits, research has demonstrated that students who are involved in extracurricular activities often have improved academic performance due to increased focus and motivation. Finally, extracurricular activities can provide a positive outlet for energy, resulting in improved mental and physical wellbeing",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
414281,"The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long.

All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school.

Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that you've learned. Student can't get everything done on weekends so they need more time. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building one's character. . Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. For instance, if I'm studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves.

What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. From students' point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

By interacting with the individual more, a person can form a better understanding of the individual. This could lead to a far different view of the individual from the initial first impression. As a person continues to interact with the individual, their perception and attitude about that person can change as a result of new experiences or conversations. Getting to know someone beyond their appearance and surface level traits can cause a drastic shift in opinion. Factors such as getting to know someone better and forming a better understanding of them can lead to differences in opinion. One of the most common is simply getting to know someone better. In addition, even the smallest of changes in behavior or attitude can sway a person to have a different first impression. As this understanding develops, any preconceived notions or biases about the individual can fade away, creating an entirely different opinion than the one initially formed. 

In conclusion, first impressions of someone can evolve and differ from the initial one formed over time.

In a world that constantly tells us to change who we are in order to fit in, it can be easy to forget what makes us unique and individual. For example, if we ignored the pressures of society to conform, we might choose to visit awe-inspiring places like a lush green forest, a secluded mountain valley, or a magnificent waterfall. It can show us how fragile and fleeting our lives can be, but also how lasting and purposeful that life can be if we are ourselves.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was well-known for stating that “to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment”. We can accept life on our own terms, and be content with who we are and where we are going. When we stay true to ourselves and dismiss the external pressures of society, we are able to find and explore new parts of ourselves we never thought possible. However, being true to ourselves and our own interests allows us to embark on wondrous journeys that others might not embark upon. I could not agree more with this statement. Being true to ourselves also opens us up to understanding life in a different way, because nature is beautiful and ever-changing",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others.         . Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy.

Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. Technology can also be damaging for the health.

Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication.

It is always best to get another persons idea. For example, Generic_Name wanted to plan a birthday party but she needs help on what theme she wants for her party. I think they ask more than one person for advice because other people can speak there opinion and give the person who wants advice some ideas. It can make the person who needs the advice to gain some confidence on what they need advice on.

Overall, I think everyone should get another idea from someone else because it gives people more ideas. When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge.

Students that graduate earlier need to have enthusiasm and know that they will have a more difficult life and realize that they will have more responsibilities and duties in society, when they are out of school they should take that as an advantage to use their time wisely and help themselves by trying to find a job and earn some money; if they are taking the decision to go to college in few years.

He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had.

As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will.

In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. The words of the student to advice the students were "" There is no more benefits than attending to school. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school.

Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?.

In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are.

It's important to have a positive attitude in everyday life because your reputation goes up, others want what you have and you set a positive mindset for yourself.

First, having a positive attitude in your daily life will raise your reputation. That's what so special about positivity, it spreads everywhere you go, as long as you are positive. When you first walk in the room, you greet the interviewer with a smile and a handshake, and you start to introduce yourself. It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. I believe that attitude is everything in life. It was a very sad event for both families and friends. For exmaple, in 1999 there was a shooting in Generic_School, 200 people died and 500 people were injured. A girl name Generic_Name was injured badly that she has to be in a hospital. For example, you are at a job interview, you dress very properly for this job interview. But what she said in the hospital that caught everyone's attention was that "" I may be hurting very badly right now and I may or may not be able to walk, but I am glad that I am still alive, and that i get to see my friends and family's faces right now"". One person being positive about something, the others follow. For example, you are doing a group project, you don't know any of the people you are working with. . In summary, being positive in a job interview will get you that job that you've been working for your whole life.

Second, people around you want what you have when you show positive attitude. People in my life have taught me that giving positive attitude around my peers is very important, because having a positive attitude can change what someone think of you. That gives the perfect first impression to getting the first place in this job. Generic_Name was injured so bad that she couldn't even walk, but she had that positive mindset that at least she's not dead. This changes people's lives every single day.

When someone have positive attitude, your reputation goes up, people want that positivity and you have a positive mindset in everything you do. In summary, positive attitude will switch your life around in life's hardest moments.

In Conclusion, positive attitude is the key to happiness and success in life. All those people in your group sees that enthusiasm, and they think "" Man! She must be a really nice peson, I wish I have that kind of positivity in my life."" Someone in that group might not been having a good day that day and they saw how positive you are and they want that same positivity that you have.

In summary, a person giving another person positive attitude can help others to be the best that they can be in life.

When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. Sometimes it is almost impossible for first impressions to change but its never to late it could come to the time it does.. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite.

If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect don't expect something else because it will come back to you and there's this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I don't think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if you're a lair don't be mad or don't ask God why is he doing this to you because that's what you planted in the beginning.

The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone you've never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, you're so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldn't want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it don't add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and you're not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guy's eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free.

It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and don't doubt it",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

It allows them to develop more skills and knowledge related to their chosen field at a much earlier age, thus setting them ahead of their peers. By taking the time to explore different options and consider their personal goals and interests, young people can set themselves up for success and avoid feeling overwhelmed by the intensity of a commitment. By committing to a career at a young age, students can begin setting their own realistic goals and planning out the steps needed to reach them.

Kids need a distraction from school, although school is really important, kids needs to distract their minds away from everything in school, like test, wetheater or not they failing, drama, all the stress schools brings sometimes. Kids needs time for themselfs, time to do something that's not always school.

Kids, parents, and teachers do other acitivites after school, for example kids go to football practice right after school or pian lessons, they might not be able to go. Parents needs to go places with their kids at a specifc time, and if they come late and kids will be too tired to go with them. Adding one more hour to school can ruin everyone's schudule.

In conclusion extending each school day can be a big change with time for everyone. Kids needs time for themself, they need distraction away from school and the time it's left for them to have a free time it might be nothing since they will be in school and then do homwork. Everything doesn't always have to be just about school. They can have doctors appointment,

since some kids get appointments late in day so they won't miss a day in school. Kids, parents, and teacher have other things to do, they all have plans and will get in the way of that.

One of the reasons why i disagree with extanding the school day is that kids will not have enough time to do other activities, for example after school programs, clubs, and practice. They just a rest from everything, they need a ""stress free"" time. Extending each school day

I totally disagree with extending each school day, because kids wouldn't have enough time do other activities, kids need a distracion away from school, they need to put their minds in something other than just school. . Teachers got palns, they need to do stuff after school, maybe their kids has a game, or they need to go to their kids rehersal and if school board extends a day, teacher would not be able to go because they are working, maybe some teachers studies after work, or they do homework if they in collage",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Okay now this is back on the topic. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .

Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other

.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
33951,"Venus, the second planet from the sun, has fascinated astronomers and scientists for centuries due to its similar size to Earth and the presence of extreme conditions. As a student, I find it incredibly intriguing to explore the various aspects of this unique world and learn more about its potential for habitability and scientific discoveries. 
1. Atmosphere and Temperature:
Venus has an incredibly thick atmosphere made primarily of carbon dioxide, which traps heat and creates a runaway greenhouse effect. As a result, the planet experiences surface temperatures of around 870°F (471°C), making it the hottest planet in our solar system. This extreme heat makes it challenging for scientists to explore Venus' surface using traditional landers and rovers due to the high temperatures and atmospheric pressure.
2. Potential for Habitability:
Although Venus' conditions are unfavorable to sustain life as we know it, scientists have speculated about the possibility of life existing in the atmosphere or in the planet's clouds. Recent research has suggested that there might be microbes or other forms of primitive life in the upper layers of the atmosphere, which are less dense and more temperate. This discovery could have significant implications for our understanding of life beyond Earth and the origins of life itself.
3. Scientific Discoveries:
Despite the harsh conditions on Venus, numerous scientific discoveries have been made throughout the years. For example, the Soviet Venera 13 and Venera 14 spacecraft successfully landed on the surface in the 1980s, providing valuable data about the planet's geology and atmosphere. Additionally, the Magellan orbiter, which studied Venus during the 1990s, helped map the planet's surface in unprecedented detail and revealed the presence of numerous volcanoes and tectonic structures.
4. Future Exploration:
As technology advances, scientists are looking into various methods to explore Venus more thoroughly. One potential approach is to develop airborne vehicles that can withstand the extreme conditions of the planet's atmosphere. Another idea is to use unmanned drones that could potentially fly through the clouds and collect data about the potential habitability and the presence of life.
In conclusion, Venus offers a unique opportunity to learn more about the origins of life and the potential for habitability in extreme conditions. As a student, exploring this planet's mysteries inspires curiosity, wonder, and the excitement of scientific discovery.",,1.0
460699,"Each individual needs to consider their specific situation and resources in order to decide which approach is most suitable for them. Each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages. . 

In conclusion, both self-made decisions and those made with the help of a person with more expertise and experience have their advantages and disadvantages. 

Seeking out advice from those with expertise and experience can be beneficial in terms of access to valuable knowledge and understanding. Furthermore, the collective wisdom of experts can provide a balance to personal biases. 
When making decisions, individuals can either rely on their own understanding and judgment or seek out guidance from those with superior expertise and experience. Self-made decisions may also provide an individual with a greater sense of accomplishment; the result of their choices and understanding are directly tangible. However, this approach has the potential to be more error-prone, as there is a lack of the experience and knowledge that others can provide. However, this approach can often be more time-consuming and costly. 

Making self-made decisions is generally quicker and requires less effort; the individual has direct control of the decision-making process. Additionally, individual biases can mean that it is difficult to make informed decisions with the best interests of everyone in mind.

33112,"Title: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Face on Mars

Introduction:

For centuries, humans have looked up at the sky and wondered if we are alone in the universe. In recent decades, space exploration has allowed us to venture farther than ever, and we continue to discover new celestial bodies that could potentially harbor life. One of the most fascinating mysteries in the solar system is the Face on Mars. This intriguing feature has captivated the imaginations of scientists and laypeople alike.
Body:
The Face on Mars is a geological structure located on the Martian surface. It was first discovered by the Viking 1 Orbiter in 1976. The feature appears to be a human face, complete with eyes, a nose, a mouth, and even a chin. Its size is approximately 1.2 kilometers wide and 350 meters high, making it a significant landmark on Mars.
The origin of this face has sparked intense debate among researchers and the public. Some believe it is evidence of extraterrestrial life or an ancient civilization that existed on Mars. Others argue that it is simply a natural geologic formation, created by wind and erosion processes on the Martian surface.
The Face on Mars has been the subject of countless conspiracy theories and pop culture references. The 2001 movie ""The Martian"" featured a scene where the protagonist, Mark Watney, discovers a statue resembling the Face on Mars. The popular TV series ""The X-Files"" also referenced the mysterious structure in their 2016 episode.
Despite its allure, the scientific community remains skeptical about the extraterrestrial origins of the Face on Mars. In 2001, NASA's Mars Global Surveyor mission provided high-resolution images of the structure. The photos revealed that the face was not a coherent formation, but rather a series of mesas and buttes that appeared to form a face when viewed from a certain angle. The erosion processes that formed the mesas and buttes are similar to those found on Earth and other planets in our solar system, supporting the idea that the Face on Mars is a natural formation.
Conclusion:
While the Face on Mars continues to captivate people's imaginations, it is essential to approach the mystery objectively, based on scientific evidence. The current understanding suggests that the feature is a product of geological processes and not an indication of extraterrestrial life or an ancient Martian civilization. Nonetheless, further exploration of Mars could reveal new and exciting discoveries that challenge our current understanding.",,1.0

ESOL classes allow immigrants to thrive inside of a school setting, which helps them to prepare for their upcoming lives in the United States. Students who opt for online classes might save a lot of time in commute, but can miss out on the extracurricular peer engagement that schools provide. Online schooling offers an impressive array of accessibility options and allows for greater convenience; however, some of the difficulties that can encourage students to attend classes usually decrease. From a physical, mental, and psychological perspective, attending school provides essential social skill development and educational opportunities that simply cannot be replicated in an online environment.

Immigrants can also benefit from attending school due to specialized programs such as ESOL. Overall, attending school has great importance for immigrants, since it serves as a bridge to a brighter future..

There have been people who use this item excessively, especially while they drive.

Driving while using cell phones can make the driver less focused, not only on the road but to your surroundings.

Not paying full attention can also slow down your reaction time.

When it comes to cell phones and driving I support the use of them with moderation (use when parked).

Cell phones can benefit the driver in many ways.

They can be used as a gps.

It helps people who are driving alone and can't get someone else to use a paper map.

A phone can be a source of entertainment too.

For those who enjoy songs or podcast that are not normally on the radio.

Most drivers can be distracted by cell phones.

One example is if their phone falls out of the vehicle mount. This action will tempt them to pick it up causing their attention to be taken off of the road which can lead to a car crash.

Another would be holding a conversation with someone one the phone.

Finally sending or reading a text message.

Even though cell phones can provide a driver with options on their experience while riding.

Being able to listen to different types and styles of music.

Also making sure you are going to the proper destination.

It should not be used to the point where it can take you attention off the rode.         ",,0.0

This would benefit us students to get things done. Maybe most of us students can also handle this policy.

By extending school day for 2 more hours isn't a bad thing. As us students would have to take action into this situation. End of the day, we just want this to help us for the real world and specially after high schools or college. This could all depends the energy we bring also. Their would be no harm. If this policy would change, we will all be still in good hands.. This would be no harm to us. More energy would increase if this would happen. Furthermore, some of us students wouldn't mind that. energy is important in this topic. This also can come with responsibilities

Well , were trying to help students out more if we change a full week, to a 4-day week. This would come to no harm for our society. This wouldn't be a problem overall. Although, this policy can come with some responsibilities. Although , it may effect some students. For example, How much energy would be transferred into a 4-day school week than a full week, way more and their is nothing wrong with that.

By handling business, taking care of things, it's all about responsibilities at the end of the day. Maybe for this policy to change, would require more school hours in the day. All were trying to do is help our community and our resources. On the other hand, maybe students in school can handle that. Coming to school with more energy to a 4-day weekend, students would often get things done more. I feel that, more energy, will come more as students. If businesses changed the policy for a 4-day week, why not us schools change that. This policy would benefit us to do better in school and out of school. Regardless, this helps us get more energy for sleep hours by making it a 4-day week. A full week might just be little too much. It could change many things, specially recourses. If schools allowed this , students would benefit this as a gift. We could make this a habit if we wanted it to be, just have to take some action in this. If we would be able to take a vote on this, I personally think our schedule would be changed for good.

When considering the pros and cons of a 10-month school year, it is best to look at the harmful and helpful advantages to students. Yet a longer school year can also be detrimental to students' mental and physical health due to the lack of adequate rest and breaks throughout the year. Not only can these longer school years disrupt the plans and goals of the students, but it can also affect family dynamics when parents are unable to take a substantial break from employment responsibilities. Changes and modifications need to be made in order to ensure the wellbeing of the students. A longer break provides much-needed restoration and respite for students and lets them take control of their dreams. This includes giving them enough space to pursue their personal interests while also maintaining their studies.. 
Studies have shown that in the United States, students from kindergarten to twelfth grade have received systematic instruction of less than 10 months a year with short summer vacations in between. Long summer breaks are often seen in other countries, with some countries dedicating up to 11 months of consecutive instruction. Although reducing summer break could provide students with more of an opportunity for class instruction, it is important to weigh the negatives that come with it. 

Therefore, when considering these factors, it is important for school systems to take into account the student’s dreams and life aspirations",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic.

Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades.

To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills. This can help students to improve their grades,because every activity count as a grade or extra credit.

Firstly,students should do extracurricular activities because this can improve their grades, if they do extra credit after school teachers can replace a missing assignment for the extra credit. Parents should be interest in these things because most students have bad grades in their classes and this is an opportunity for improve grades. Doing sports is an activity that can help kids to be healthy and stronger.. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends.

Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. 78% of Americans students do extracurricular activities, by staying after school,doing sports and serving on the student council",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Third, students will be better prepared for test.

Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Education is also super important because it is through out life. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important.

Second, students could have better job opportunity. It is also good for some student. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test.

First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities.

33948,"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves

Once upon a time, in the vast and beautiful countryside of Texas, there lived a brave and adventurous cowboy named Buck. Buck loved spending his days herding cattle and exploring the vast plains, but his heart always longed for something more. He dreamt of adventures beyond his humble life on the ranch, of traveling far and wide, and experiencing new and thrilling things.
One fateful day, while sitting around the campfire with his trusted companions, the other cowboys, they stumbled upon an old book about the thrilling world of surfing. They were captivated by its stories of surfers conquering massive waves, gliding effortlessly across the water's surface, and experiencing a rush unlike anything else.
Inspired by the tales of surfing and its daring adventures, Buck decided that he had to give it a try. He gathered his courage and began to teach himself how to surf using the book as his guide and practicing on the gentle waves along the riverbank. As the days and weeks passed, Buck's skills improved, and he grew more confident.
One day, Buck decided to take his surfing journey to the next level. He packed his trusty horse into a small trailer and set out on a long journey, following the coastline all the way to the sunny state of California. There he heard tales of incredible waves and surfing spots, where the world's best surfers gathered to ride the wildest waves they could find.
Upon arriving in California, Buck was awed by the beauty of the ocean and its powerful waves crashing against the shore. He quickly met other surfers who welcomed him with open arms and shared their passion for this thrilling sport. Buck spent days and nights learning from the locals, honing his skills, and pushing his limits further than he ever thought possible.
As time went on, Buck's reputation as a daring and skilled surfer began to spread across the beaches. People from all over flocked to watch him ride the waves and marveled at his unique style, blending the cowboy spirit with the thrill of surfing. Buck became known as the ""Cowboy Who Rode the Waves,"" and his story inspired others to pursue their own dreams and venture beyond their comfort zones.
In the end, Buck's journey took him far from his humble beginnings in Texas, but it taught him the importance of courage, perseverance, and embracing new experiences. He returned to his beloved ranch, forever changed by the adventures he had encountered, and shared his love for surfing with the other cowboys. They too began to explore the world beyond their home, finding adventure and excitement in every corner they explored.
And so, the tale of the Cowboy Who Rode the Waves came to an end, but its message of chasing dreams and embracing new experiences lived on, inspiring others to follow their hearts and push themselves beyond their limits just as Buck had once done.",,1.0
232031,"As a student, has your learning process ever been impeded by your emotional state? Have you ever wished a teacher could read your mind? The article ""Mating Mona Lisa Smile"" is about a new software system called the Facial Action Coding System which can detect emotions based on facial movements. Technology such as the Facial Action Coding Systems can be valuable in reading the emotional expressions of students in a classroom and sensing varying degrees of boredom, confusion, or sadness; this data can then be used to create better fit lessons for the students.

To begin, Prof. Thomas Huang and his team have been working to develop ways for robots to better communicate with people. The Facial Action Coding System, which calculates movement of all 44 major muscles on your face, was created. These movements can be used to classify happiness, surprise, anger, disgust, fear, and sadness.

First, in a classroom setting, this system could be used to detect whether a student is bored with a lesson plan. The lesson plan could then be changed. Next, the Facial Action Coding System could also be used to detect if a student is confused. This data could indicate that a student may need additional help with a lesson or an alternate lesson plan. Lastly, another emotion the Facial Action Coding System could help with is sadness. If the system detects that a student is constantly sad, the school administration can loot into this and verify that the student is emotionally stable.

For many students, a poor emotional state as well as confusion and boredom, impede their ability to learn in school. In a classroom setting, a Facial Action Coding System would be beneficial to detect a student's current emotion and adjust the lesson plan accordingly.",,0.0
60471,"I feel like everything starts with immagination first. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Then nothing happened to your company. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. You kept asking people to invest your company. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. When I go to school. Although they said that you started a company anyways. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.

So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. One day you will achive your goal or dream.

One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. But they only need one. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. That's what a lot of people do. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality. Which means effort creates achivements. But knowledge is still really important. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take.    . So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.

Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.

Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

Firstly, I do believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. The only reason I say this is,because I was one of those students that didn't interact with anyone because of my attitude. Being joyful and happy in life will allow you to accomplish and allow you to work 100 percent good.

Lastly, all I have to say is that positive attitude is the key to success in life. Meaning they might would like to share with you on how they found the key to success. That's why there is a saying teat people the way you want to be treated. A lot of people think that positive attitude is the key to success in life. After that you would probably would like to share the key to your success, and how it helped you accomplish your goals that you might have thought that you never would.

Thirdly, this may lead you to the success in life that you have been dreaming about. I didn't know that having all this kindness and positive energy could reflect on who i am today. Now that I have learn and taught my self to be the person who I am today I have made so many friends that I didn't know I would talk. I think that having positive attitude in life is the key to success, and you might ask your why. Why you might ask your self. That why I say have good strong positive energy and you will get a lot back in life        . That being millionaire or stepping up in your woke place etc. Having good positive energy will allow you to meet new people and they might want to interact with you for having good energy surrounding.

Secondly, this may allow you to meet new people. Having all this positively and good energy will get you along way in life.

722088,"I think everyone who doesnt find it important should really think twice. Yes I understand that some classes are better than others, but its all required for one to graduate.

In my opinion i support both sides of the story. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. Graduating in the normal four years is grate if you dont know what your going to be yet after high school. Gradating early is not for everyone some struggle in the normal four standard years of high school. It is not a requirement at all. Graduating early is only for those who already want to go to college or go into the work force. There is never no rush. . Some people want to start their life early some do not. Always take your time its your future. Even if you wanted to graduate early its a challenge. on the other hand some many not and find it important and waste of time. High school is not a race its preparing you for your future its good to take all the time you need maybe if need to stay in extra year or two.

In conclusion like I said ""I support both sides"" it is not necessary to graduate nor is it a requirement. its nice to graduate early because if one goes to college they see that and they think best of you.

On the other hand i do not think it's a good a idea to graduate early. Only if you have the right skills and capability for it. Most find it very very important if you want to succeed in life and make great money. Would you like to start your life early?

Some find it beneficial, allowing the students to have a taste of freedom an independence in their work environment, while others think of it as an excuse to stay home and slack off. Pushing that agenda forward, many schools offer students the opportunity to take some of their classes off campus at a different location such as a community college campus or even in the comforts of their own homes. With that being said, more students are choosing to take their classes at different locations instead of the traditional setting. Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional settings of a school by letting them get a taste of their own educational freedom, and by lowering their stress levels while letting them become more comfortable in their own work environment.

Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by giving them a taste of what their own educational freedom is like. Many college students around the world use online schooling in comparison to physical schooling on a campus. In the United States alone, many college students choose to use online schooling for a number of reasons. Online schooling may be used by them to help balance their lives, choosing to be able to do their work at their own time, compared to being in a building or university, where the deadlines are strict and there is possibly a hard time balancing their lives and school if they have a family. Having that type of educational freedom is very important in that sense, as to help students, no matter how old they are, achieve their educational goals in less of a strict environment.

Students can benefit from taking classes away from the traditional setting by helping lower their stress levels and being more comfortable in their own work environment. Many students face the intense pressures of being in a brick and mortar school environment and often can't handle it, becoming very uncomfortable where they are and losing sight of themselves in the stress. By pulling those students out of the environment that hinders their ability to learn and retain information properly due to their stress and lack of comfort, and placing them into an environment where they can prosper, retain and possibly learn faster can truly help students become better and more confident in themselves and the work they put out to the world. When students are constantly stressed out in their school setting, it makes it harder for them to excel in their studies, even when it isn't a subject that is particularly hard for them, so allowing them the extra educational freedom of choosing how they want to take their classes, whether it be completely at home on the computer, completely physical in a brick and mortar buliding, or some mixture of the two, students can combat their educational stress.

Not all students face the problem of being stressed in the school setting, some quite like how the curriculum can be set and like the challenges of strict due dates and lectures. More often than not, though, students do find it hard to juggle their schoolwork and their lives. Giving them the option to be able to replace the way they learn and their schooling in general can pave the way for them to become comfortable in their work setting, more dedicated to their work, and overall much happier students than they were before. By grabbing their attention with the benefits of schooling in ways that are seen as less stressful and easier, they can put more effort into their studies and get higher grades, all while getting a taste of all the different ways of schooling in college are like in the world.                                                                                                                                                                                      ",,0.0
84836,"The Benefits of Student-Designed Summer Projects

School requires studying, tests, practicing, and now doing what is called a summer project. This means doing something over summer break that relates to some sort of school subject. Students should be able to design their own summer projects because it is their time off, they would have the luxury of choosing their own topic, and they would learn the importance of constructing and designing their own project. Teachers could argue that there are more learning benefits for the students if it is teacher-designed, but at the end of the day, summer is supposed to be a time off from instructional learning.

Summer break is supposed to be a time for students to relax and reflect on their previous year of school. Normally people have plans over summer, maybe to travel, visit family, get a job, etc. If a teacher assigns a project over summer, that could interfere with plans already made; whereas if a student designs their own project, they can schedule it to fit their needs. With all the hard classes kids take during the school year, summer break helps them unwind and prepare for the next year. A student-designed project could give kids the benefit to make their own rules and set their own limits to what they can handle.

A student-designed summer project would mean that the student could pick whatever topic they choose, and carry it out however they choose. Having set guidelines from a teacher can box in one's imagination. Summer is the time for people to explore and do things that interest them, if a teacher gives out a topic for each student, it might not be what the students are drawn to and their potential for a great project could slip away. It is so much easier and more fun to do a project that you are passionate about, instead of one that you are only doing for a grade.

Projects can require a lot of planning, focus, and research. Student-designed summer projects will teach kids the importance of constructing their own projects and meeting requirements on their own. This would give students the chance to use their own voice on their project, and it would prepare them for the real world. Teachers often give out rubrics, resources, guidelines, etc. to students, but work is not always just going to be written out step-by-step for them. Without the babying of a teacher, students would learn to be confident in their own work and not second-guess themselves.

One might argue that teacher-designed summer projects are better for students learning and skills. Teacher-designed projects would probably be a little more straight forward and tell the students exactly what they are looking for in their projects. They might also benefit students in an area that they struggled in before; the projects could be focused around one specific subject for each student. Teacher-designed projects would probably be much easier for teachers to grade because they would most likely make a rubric and guidelines for the projects. All of these reasons still do not make up for the endless opportunities that kids would have if the summer projects were student-designed.

All in all, student-designed summer projects would benefit kids in more ways than one. Kids need to have time off from school in the summer, they need to have the luxury of choosing their own topic, and they need to be prepared to construct their own work like they would in the real world. If the purpose of projects are to learn and understand something better, why not let kids grow as people while learning school-related material? ",,0.0

However, working with a team or group of people can present its own set of challenges. It can develop important communication and team-building skills, promote problem-solving abilities, and foster creativity and critical thinking. In order to manage these differences, it is important to agree on a few ground rules in advance. In addition, these activities can be a great way to make friends and broaden social networks. Disagreements and arguments are common, and it can be difficult for everyone to share an opinion without offending someone else.

Reason #2 is you don't have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins.

For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you can't go outside cause it's to dark and your parents won't let you cause of hours of school.

I was tempted to write her off as not worth my time and leave, but I decided to give her another chance. I'm glad I did, because when I gave her a second chance to make an impression, I was relieved to find she was actually a kind and compassionate person. This experience reinforced my belief that it is important to consider second impressions even when first impressions may not be favorable..

After school homework clubs have become increasingly popular in recent years as a way to help students learn and stay on top of their school work. For many students, having a dedicated time and space to do their homework creates a better learning environment and can help to motivate them to get their work done. 

Overall, after school homework clubs have a range of advantages for both students and educators. They also provide teachers with added insight into their students’ development and progress.. They create an environment that can promote learning and provide additional support for students who need it. 

For teachers, after school homework clubs provide an opportunity to monitor progress and give students extra help when needed.

Education is a critical element of any high school student's future, and the importance of this education cannot be overstated. 

It is important to provide students with the necessary guidance and support to ensure they have the best chance for success in their future endeavors. 

One of the most significant potential problems with committing to a career at a young age is that students may be unprepared or undereducated for their chosen profession. Encouraging students to take their time to explore and research various career paths can have positive impacts on their mental and physical health, as well as their school work. This premature commitment to one career can have major implications on a student's school work, mental health, and physical health. Providing students with the tools and resources to develop an individualized plan for their future career can help to ensure that they have the best possible chance of achieving success.. Without the necessary education or tools, students may be unable to succeed in their chosen careers, leading to feelings of frustration and diminished self-worth. Additionally, a premature commitment to a career can lead to unrealistic expectations, burn out, and a lack of motivation. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for some students to begin to identify their future career paths before completing their high school education",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In the end, he achieved great successes, becoming one of the most influential figures of the modern era. Rather than being content to run a successful business, Musk took a risk that many people thought was too ambitious and started challenging the status quo of both the auto industry and space exploration. A great example of this is the story of Elon Musk, the founder of Tesla and Space X. 
 Michelangelo's statement that ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark"" is a poignant reminder of how easy it is to become complacent in settling for mediocrity, rather than aiming big and taking risks in pursuit of success.

445371,"Advertisements are a integral part of our early lives. We are bombarded with them on television, billboards, social media, and even on our mobile phones. Advertisements are designed to persuade us to buy a particular product or service. However, the question remains: do advertisements make products seem much better than they really are? In my opinion, most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are. In this essay, I well provide specific reasons and examples to support my answer.

Firstly, advertisements use various techniques to make products seem better than they really are. For instance, they use flashy graphics, attractive models, and catchy slogans to grab our attention. Advertisements also use emotional appeals to persuade us to buy a product. They create a sense of urgency by making us feel like we need the product right away. For example, a perfume advertisement might show a beautiful woman wearing the perfume and suggest that by wearing the same perfume, we too can be as attractive as the woman RN the advertisement. However, RN reality, the perfume might not have the same effect on us as rt did on the woman RN the advertisement.

Secondly, advertisements often exaggerate the benefits of a product. They highlight only the positive aspects of the product and ignore the negative ones. For instance, an advertisement for a weight loss poll might claim that the poll can help us lose 10 pounds RN a week without any exercise or dieting. However, RN reality, such claims are often false, and the poll might have harmful side effects. Therefore, rt rs essential to be cautious and do our research before buying a product based on rt's advertisement.

Lastly, advertisements often use misleading language to make products seem better than they really are. For example, an advertisement for a fast food chain might claim that their burgers are made with 100% beef. However, they might not mention that the beef rs of low quality or that the burgers are high RN calories and unhealthy. Similarly, an advertisement for a beauty product might claim that rt rs ""all natural"" or ""organic,"" but rt might contain harmful chemicals that are not good for our skin.

In conclusion, most advertisements do make products seem much better than they really are. Advertisements use various techniques to persuade us to buy a product, such as flashy graphics, emotional appeals, and misleading language. They also exaggerate the benefits of a product and ignore the negative aspects. Therefore, rt rs essential to be cautious and do our research before buying a product based on rt's advertisement. We should not fall for the hype and make informed decisions based on our needs and preferences.

Admittedly, there are some drawbacks to implementing a curfew, such as potentially infringing on the rights of young people by preventing them from participating in certain activities. Additionally, this can also boost local businesses who may suffer from broken windows and loitering. To counter this, cities could offer alternative activities geared towards teenagers and create a safe environment for them to congregate. Furthermore, it also gives parents peace of mind knowing that their children are safe and not engaging in potentially dangerous activities. 

Overall, implementing a curfew for teenagers can be beneficial for many reasons. By requiring teenagers to be home at certain times, it eliminates potential opportunities for crime, especially among young people. 

Creating a curfew also has economic benefits. Studies show that curfews can help reduce the amount of criminal activity that occurs late at night. 
Implementing a curfew for teenagers can have a positive impact on crime rates and public safety in cities.

Overall, taking classes online or through video conferencing can provide busy students and those interested in classes with more convenience. This can be highly beneficial for those with commitments that may prevent them from taking classes in a traditional setting, and can open up many learning opportunities for students.. Additionally, online coursework provides the ability to access material from multiple resources, giving students a more in-depth understanding of the course. This can also be beneficial for those who may not be able to attend traditional classes, such as those with physical disabilities. Virtual meetings with professors can ensure that the student remains engaged and is able to interact with their professor much in the same way as if they were in a physical classroom. 

In an online setting, students have the advantage of greater flexibility and being able to work around other commitments. While there may be specific deadlines for assignments, students can utilize the convenience of online to their advantage and submit work when it's most convenient for them. 

For students living far away from their school, taking classes through video conferencing can provide many of the same advantages. With no physical boundaries, educational opportunities are enabled for those who may not otherwise have access to them.

You also get to visit other places and see unusual things. One of the dangers of going on a cattle boat though is being out in the middle of the sea, so you always have to watch your back and be careful what you do. One of the good things about going on a cattle boat is when you do go on one you might learn something's about animals.

Another thing is that you get to help people in need. Another good thing is that you might make a new friend in another country. You also might go back to that country for a trip with your family.

It's nice when your friends ask you to do something like going to another country and helping people out. When you go and help people like Luke did just think about those people and how they felt about you helping them with getting food and water. After you're done helping someone in need like Luke did it kinda makes you feel happy that you did that for that person. Plus if you were to go on a cattle boat it's not all just work you can also have a little fun playing tennis, boxing, fencing, Table tennis, and whittling and reading.

I fail the class and sol because of use cell phone everyday.

School may not be allow to use cell phone in classroom because if school allow to use cell phone in classroom then students may not be able to learn anything.

If students are allow to use cell in school, then when students are doing testing they might be chage to chat on test.

Students can leave study, they gonna force on play phone.

Finally, When students have work in classroom they are so lazy to do it because they are busy to play game or use phone. That the mind reason school should not allow to use phone, it good sometime to use phone but not when we have work to do. They think teacher give us to use phone so, we don't have to do anything and they don't do homework, classwork and study. When we keep use phone then we can't listen what teacher saying. In school we have lot of work to do, if teacher give us using phone then students might not do it. So, we have work then teacher sholud not give us using phone because lots of students are busy with phone or play game.

While, Many students are distorton by cell phone because they can't force on study. I'm disagree with it because cell phone can distortion to students, school may not be allow to use cell in calssroom, and they will lazy to do work.

First, Now a day many students are failing classes because most of the teacher allow to students use cell phone during they are teaching.

In conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. Many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. We should select the job that attends our demands. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation.

The world has seen the ""Face"" taken by NASA a few years ago. Some people say it's a natural landform and some people say it's an alien creation. NASA has figured out that it's just a natural landform on Mars and nothing else. NASA haven't explored all mars and can state it's an alien creation, there might be more than just one, and they all could be natural landforms. It might look like a really weird face from above, but NASA has already stated that it's a natural landform.

NASA has explored a lot of Mars, but not enough information to say it's an alien creation. They've just found one, and it looks pretty like a huge face to some people. They might find more out there just like this, and it's still and ordinary landform. On Earth there are a lot of these landforms around the American West. NASA has taken a picture in really high quality camera to show that it's just a natural landform there.

Before America had these great cameras and computers, they weren't able to get a clear picture of the face. So people just assumed that it was an alien creation/monument. If they say it is where are the facts that say it's an alien monument. Later after all those years, NASA were able to take a maximum resolution picture and post it to the world. Thousands of people were waiting to see the photo, but when they did, it was just a natural landform. There was no alien creation to see and observe at.

Although NASA has said it's just a natural landform, people state that sometimes NASA doesn't want us to know certain things. Some people say it could've been a monument created by an alien civilization on Mars. They haven't gone through all mars and know that was there or not. NASA might eventually find more of these landforms and study to actually say it's an alien creation. Conspiracy theorists state that the face is bona fide evidence and that NASA would hide them from us. The world doesn't know what's out there to say that it's this, or it's that.

Since, NASA people say that it's a natural landform, people believe them. The ""face"" is nothing else than a landform on Mars, it's known to find some of these landforms around the American West. NASA has already proven that it's just an ordinary landform with a maximum resolution camera and posted it to the world to see. NASA has hid a lot of stuff from us and right now in this situation, people believe that they're lying to the U.S. Some people believe in NASA, some people in conspiracy theorists, but who knows what that ""face"" is.

112141,"I am in grade 6 and I believe that the minimum wage should be raised in our country. There are several reasons why I think this is a good idea.

Firstly, raising the minimum wage will help people who are struggling to make ends meet. Many people who work minimum wage jobs hate to work multiple jobs just to pay their bills and put food on the table. This is not fair, and it is not sustainable. By raising the minimum wage, we can help these people to lite more comfortably and to hate a better quality of life.

Secondly, raising the minimum wage will help to reduce poverty in our country. When people are paid a fair wage, they are less likely to rely on government assistance programs like food stamps and welfare. This means that we can saTe money as a society by investing in our workforce and paying people a living wage.

Finally, raising the minimum wage will help to stimulate the economy. When people hate more money to spend, they are more likely to spend it on goods and services. This means that businesses will see an increase in sales, which will lead to more jobs and a stronger economy overall.

In conclusion, I think that raising the minimum wage is a good idea for our country. It will help people who are struggling to make ends meet, reduce poverty, and stimulate the economy. I hope that our leaders will consider this issue carefully and make the right decision for our country.",,1.0

Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasn't really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you don't really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. The more you get older the more you know about the job so you'll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age.

Reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea. Your brain also isn't fully developed until you're older it is a proven fact.

Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. When you're older you'll be an expert and know the job by memory. There for you wouldn't be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically.

As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. Committing to a job at a Young age is bad and good idea, why you may ask? Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age.  . That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. For example let's say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. It'll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable.

While some argue that cell phones can be a valuable tool for education, others argue that they can be a distraction and negatively affect grades. Zn this essay, z will explore the advantages and disadvantages of using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes.

One of the main advantages of using cell phones in the classroom is the opportunity to enhance student engagement. Cell phones are equipped with a wide range of features, such as multimedia capabilities, internet connectivity, and interactive applications, which can be used to enhance the learning experience. For example, teachers can use cell phones to create interactive lessons, provide instant feedback, and engage students in collaborative activities.

Another advantage of using cell phones in the classroom is the ability to provide students with instant access to information. With the internet at their fingertips, students can quickly research topics, access educational resources, and collaborate with their peers. This can help students to develop critical thinking skills, research skills, and collaboration skills, which are essential for success in today's world.

However, there are also several disadvantages to using cell phones in the classroom. One of the main disadvantages is the potential for distraction. Cell phones are equipped with a wide range of features, such as social media, games, and messaging apps, which can be a distraction to students. Zf students are not using their cell phones for educational purposes, they may be more likely to miss important information, lose focus, and not achieve their full potential.

Another disadvantage of using cell phones in the classroom is the potential for cheating. With the internet at their fingertips, students may be tempted to cheat on exams or assignments. This can undermine the integrity of the educational system and make it difficult for teachers to assess student knowledge and skills accurately.

Zn conclusion, the use of cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has both advantages and disadvantages. While cell phones can enhance student engagement and provide instant access to information, they can also be a distraction and lead to cheating. Zt is important for teachers to use cell phones in a responsible and ethical manner, and for students to use them for educational purposes only.

In order to break away from the chains of conformity and realize our own potential, we should strive to be different. Refusing to limit our ability to think, act and experience the world differently opens the door to seizing greater opportunities and relationships.

Going beyond conformity is a challenge. Society is constantly changing and evolving, so it stands to reason that if we want to reach success and keep the people we love in our lives, we must be willing to go beyond merely following the status quo.

Living within the boundaries of society comes with certain expectations and standards that may not align with our best interests. We should be adventurous in our pursuits, open-minded in our thoughts, and allow ourselves to explore different avenues with an optimistic outlook. It involves taking risks, pushing ourselves into unknown territory and continuously adapting to unforeseen difficulties.

One dislike I don't like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. But still can be able to help others in need. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. You can learn from it and help other's or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. When you're looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. There are multiple options that can occur.

Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others people's opinion's about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if it's gonna be a bad time or a good time. It's really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one person's own opinion.

One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause.

Hey, so I think having a positive attitude is super important for success in life. Like, it's just a vibe, you know? But seriously, it's true. If you're always looking on the bright side of things, you're gonna be way more successful than someone who's always complaining and stuff.

One reason why is because positive people are way more confident. They're like, ""Yeah, I can do this!"" and they're not afraid to take risks. They're like, ""I'm gonna go for it, even if it doesn't work out!"" And that's how they achieve their goals. They're not held back by fear or doubt.

Another reason is that positive people are way more attractive to other people. Like, if you're always smiling and being nice to people, they're gonna want to be around you more. And that can lead to new opportunities and stuff. Plus, it's just nicer to be around someone who's positive and fun.

But, I mean, there are also some arguments against this idea. Some people say that having a positive attitude can be naive, like you're not seeing the real problems in the world. And they're right, sometimes you gotta be aware of the bad stuff too. But I think that's where balance comes in. You can still be positive and aware of the bad stuff at the same time. It's not like you gotta be blind to the problems to be successful.

And also, some people say that having a positive attitude can be a form of denial. Like, you're not dealing with the reality of the situation, you're just ignoring it. But I think that's where perspective comes in. You can still be positive and realistic at the same time. It's not like you gotta choose one or the other.

During the summer He go to the summer school for to pass other class that he going to have in 10 grade, finish the summer school He pass the class with excellent grade, so this student had a so much credit of the normal.

He stars the 10 grade, so He had other advanced classes, because in summer school he pass the classes that He was going to have in 10 grade. If you not want to go to the collage, the diploma of the High School is very important for have a good job in your life. Students graduated in three year of the High School!

I think is good idea because all student that want a best future try to do a good thing that it is a benefit for the school. when a student is smart make the time important for take other course for to have for credit is for that some student don't need to take the four grade in the high school, A student also that have excellent grade in all the classes, and only have a difficult classes, this student that had the opportunity for graduated early that other students.

Example:

A student of Generic_School is in 9 grade, but this student have a difficult classes, but this students is focus just in the classes, and have a excellent grade also this student take a deport after school all the days. Now this students is in 11 grade, but the student had a big credit and He go to the school for 4 classes so this student have the opportunity for graduated in 11 grade because is a excellent student.

He finally is graduated the school in 11 grade, so He finish the school, but He said that want to go the collage because want to prepare more for to go to the university, because He want to be a excellent lawyer.

The excellent student finish the collage, and the university, so now He is a big lawyer with a great statutes. Many student wants to have a excellent grade but don't put of they part for be a good students.

Now in day the most students just want to come to school for 3 or 4 classes but don't want study for had a good grade,many students go to school but don't go the classes, and other students is stay outside of school for smoky, because the most students used cigarette or other thing.

We don't know appreciated the best opportunity of the life.

Reasons for graduated in three year

All students who graduated early have a big opportunity in the collage, and the university, and the work or whatever place.

why?

because the old person thinking that this type of person are responsible in all the thing.

Are a people responsible!

Why?

because when have a big responsibility never said 'NO' and have care for all thing.

Example:

I'm Generic_Name, I work in Bank Of America, today my boss need to leave early because He had a compromised with other important person, and He give me the responsibility for received the money of today.

Be carefully!

Why?

because they try to make with carefully the work or whatever thing.

Example:

My name is Generic_Name, and I work a company of cake, and my supervisor said me congratulation because you are very carefully with the work all the time.

My Idea!

I think all the people we have the best opportunity in the life to be a best person in the live,but the major opportunity is that when we have somebody is protected, and supported our decisions.

When we start the education needed to keep the marge for be the person who we want to be. The thing are best when we support all bad thing.

The best idea is continue with the school and be a good students, because all student that it is educated, they type students have a more opportunity that other who they don't want to be a best person in the future.

Why the younger people just thinking in pass the life in party or in the street?

Why now in day we see a kids abandoned in the street?

Because many mother don't have a good education for to have a compromise of the had a kids, this type of mother just thinking in that the drugs,alcohol,or party is the major thing.

Many mother having a bad decisions!

So is for that what we need to prepare for to make more easy our life.

Have a diploma of the High School is very important because we work less, and we have a good job,when we have a good job we have a lot money, and when this happened we are prepare for take a funny moment in our life, But just for that is not the base for make whatever thing, first we need think what we need to do!

We know that this life is so hurt, and is more hurt when we take a bad decision like not finish the school or don't put care to our thing for to be prospered.

Some time is good help take course when the people don't finish the school.

Example:

take a course for by the license, and put a beauty salon.

take a course for by idea how to have a company of electricity.

take a course for be some body also a little important in the life.

take a course for be a teacher of music.

We have so much course for prepare more when we don't finish the school.

Some time when a students go to the school, and they not finish is responsibility of the parent guardian because the parent need to see for the son or daughter keep going the school, I think when the students don't finish the school part of this is fault of the parents.

How we can finished the school, and how can I do graduated?

The things for to finished the school is:

Go to the school every day.

Make the homework.

Prepared for the quiz or test.

Pass all the SOL.

Pass all the classes.

When you make all the work in the classes or in the school, and you pass all the thing, you can graduated. The parents of this excellent students, and good person, so they feeling fortunate for have a big son.

All we have the opportunity for to be a best person in the life, all depended how we wants to be in the life.          ",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

After researching the requirements for becoming a mechanic, I learned that most professionals in the field possess a diploma from a technical or trade school, have worked as assistants to experienced mechanics for several years, and have aptitudes for mechanical work. I was able to talk to the employees and ask questions about their daily tasks as well as best practices in the industry. I also observed the mechanics as they worked on different repair projects, gaining valuable insights into the work process I would soon be doing.. There are numerous types of jobs available in the field, such as diesel mechanics, who specialize in working with heavy-duty equipment, and automotive technicians, who specialize in cars and trucks.

Well she went and ended up getting hit in her face. We just wanted to be like everybody else"". Or is it because they would like to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know what's best for us, we can learn from our mistake, and we want to be more independent.

First, when we do something bad and get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. But we know what we're doing ( well at least some of us know). If we know something we're doing is wrong but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldn't make fun of us or we want to be ""cool"". Knowing they are bad but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen or they get you in trouble just so you can fit into the group. we would want to figure things out by ourselves and be more independent.

We know when they telling us that we shouldn't do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. . For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hang out with. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place.

Last, we don't listen our parents or any adults telling us what's right and what's wrong. Why do we need to seek guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matters? Why can't we make our own decisions? It's because the adults knows what's best for their kids and they been through everything that we are experiencing right now as a teenagers. Now she doesn't go to parties anymore.

Then, we know what's best for us. We sometimes try to hide the problem and solve it our selves but it doesn't go well.

In conclusion, teenagers today will want to do everything and not listening to the adults. But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. But,

at the end of the day we learn from our mistake and become a better person in life. For example, I had a friend and she decided to go to a party and I told her not to go because it's always a fight. I tried and warned her but she make her own decisions and I wanted her to make her own decisions so I let her go.

This could lead to burnout, as well as reduce the amount of time that students have to fully comprehend the material. On the one hand, having four days at school could have many advantages. Firstly, by packing the same amount of material into four days instead of five, students would have more time to dedicate to other areas. Secondly, it would allow students to reduce the amount of time they spend commuting, which could have a positive effect on their stress levels. It is important to carefully weigh both the pros and cons before making any decisions regarding this issue.. 
In the modern world, where people are increasingly pressed for time and working long hours, the idea of a four-day work week with each day consisting of ten hours at school has become the subject of much debate. It would mean that students would have a greater amount of material to cover in every class compared to a five-day week, by 20 percent in total. 

Overall, increasing the length of school days from five to four with each day being ten hours long is an idea that could bring advantages to students, such as having more free time and reducing their stress levels, but also has some downsides such as leading to burnout and reducing students’ knowledge. This could be used to get more sleep, take part in extra-curricular activities, or to spend time with family and friends.

When it comes to productivity, curfews could lead to a decrease in nighttime economic activities such as night shifts by teens, and potentially hinder personal and educational development. 
Enforcing a curfew for teens in cities can have positive and negative effects on public safety, wellbeing, and productivity. On one hand, curfews can be beneficial for well-being insofar as they protect teens from potential harm or danger, and provide a structure to regulate their behavior. This could be counteracted, however, by developing a personal curfew that allows teens to engage in productive activities and still stay safe. Establishing a personal curfew and monitoring its use could help teens to become more responsible for their wellbeing and better prepared for adulthood.. Furthermore, some research indicates that the effects of curfews on delinquency and crime are overstated. 

Well-being, too, has been found to be affected by curfew implementation. One potential positive outcome is that a curfew could, in theory, reduce crime and delinquency among teens, which would in turn increase public safety. On the other hand, the restrictions of a curfew could lead to an increase in conflicts between teens and their parents, as well as bands on social interaction, both of which could have a negative impact on their overall wellbeing. On the other hand, some experts suggest that curfews could lead to dangers such as over-policing or police harassment of teens, which would be a violation of their rights, as well as an additional safety risk",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

In conclusion is more essay for you if working in group because you can make friends , you can helping together, and you have more time for you work.. WORKING IN GROUP

Why the most students like working in group and not alone? the most students prefer working with friends, because in schools the works or homework require more the one students ,but .Some people said of working alone is more benefits for the students. I believe of working in group you can make friends, helping together, and have more time for you work.

The first reason,

if working in group you can make friends because you need talk about the work,

sometime the students speak their experience or opinions about the work,but when the students is not the same country, and the works talk about the country or religious is good because. Because sometime the teachers not give much day for you work ,and the work is hard, and require much information you can divide the work with you friend . The students have different opinion and sometime you make friends when you with other students have the same opinion, and when working in group you and your friends have time for talk.

In second reason helping together, because you can ask if you work is good or opinions about the work and look of more information. You can help for materials if you friend not have, and helping together if you consider the work is good or not or change sometime or have or ideas you can tell.

Although some may suggest that having students complete their high school education in three years instead of four could provide cost savings and reduce the number of dropouts, this would come with a number of cons.

To begin, a shorter graduation timeframe could lead to an increased number of unprepared students entering college. These classes are essential for many college majors, and without them, students would not be adequately prepared to take on the coursework for college-level classes.

Additionally, reduced opportunities could result from having students graduate early. Without a full four years of high school, students would miss out on the full range of classes and experiences that are part of a standard high school education. 
High school is an important milestone in a young person's life, and it is generally accepted that a four-year program is the appropriate timeframe for most students to achieve the necessary skills needed for college and to prepare for adult life. It is therefore important to consider the potential drawbacks of an accelerated high school experience before implementing such a change.. With fewer years to experience high school, students may not have enough time to take advantage of extracurricular activities and clubs, such as student government or volunteering, or to make connections with teachers and classmates that could be used as references for college or job applications.

Finally, some research has shown that coming from an extended high school experience may make it more likely for students to successfully finish college. Without the full four years of a high school education, students may struggle to adjust to the rigors of college.

I think you should consider enforcing policy number 1. Policy number one is better for the school because if you would just let kids use their cell phones and other electronics, more students would probably pay more attention in class.

Instead of trying to text their friends in class because they cant text them at nutrition or lunch, or trying to listen to their IPODS because they can listen to it at nutrition or lunch, if you enforce policy number 1.

If us as students realize the rules your making are sort of unfair because sometimes teachers use their phone in and out of class and we don't get to use our cell phones (that's a little hypocritical), and if we think the rules are unfair were obviously not going to listen to them and make our own rules and have or make our own freedom.

So i ask as a fellow student , as an eighth grader for you to choose policy number 1, because if you choose policy number more students will pay more attention in class, learn more, get better grades, also as eighth graders you will have helped us make our last year here way better than it was going to be, and would have given us our freedom, and your trust.

Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set.

Setting your aims low and achieving your marks is not the great danger or a danger.            . The greater danger for most of us is setting our aims too high and falling short because many people try to aim for something that's imposible for them to accomplish, falling short on your goal will make you want to give up, and not having the motivation and energy will get you no where.

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we can't accoplish it.

For example: some people aim to be perfect; but that's imposible because no one is perfect.

Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they don't have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en they're wasting their time.

The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if they're aiming to high.

Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short.

Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure.

This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for.

Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if you're a failure, then you'll face many challenges and suffer.

If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it.

Distance learning, or the utilization of technology-based tools as an alternative to traditional in-person instruction, has become an increasingly popular option in the educational context. Certain students, such as those who do not have consistent access to the internet or reliable technology, may face difficulty in completing their course material in a timely and efficient manner. Distance learning can be an effective and beneficial form of learning in some contexts, but it can also be limiting and counterproductive in others.. Distance learning has the potential to provide students with increased flexibility and autonomy over their learning, such as the ability to work at their own pace or attend to other commitments while still accessing course material. In addition, distance learning makes courses offered by different institutions available to anyone with access to the internet, opening up more learning possibilities.

At the same time, distance learning can be detrimental to some students. Furthermore, direct instructions and guidance from teachers can be severely limited in a distance learning environment, which can be problematic for those who require more support in their learning.

One of the reasons the electoral college must stay is that they will be a certainty of the outcomes, they will know exact what will be coming out as a result instead of being uncertain for example source 1 Obama received 6.1 percent from the electoral vote and 51.3 percent for the poplar votes. It was an uncertain vote because the college don't know what the people would pick as a result. But many people think that it should be like that because they are voting for a slate of elector and not for president. Source 2 Another good reason why the electoral college is a good idea is that it balances the state votes. The states that are larger such as Texas and California have a much larger population, so the votes would be larger but the electoral college balances out and the smaller states such as new Jersey and main have a small population so the votes would be smaller. The larger states get more attention from the presidential candidates than the smaller states, so the electoral college balances it out. Source 3 Also the electoral college avoids runoff elections. The electoral college gives more for a Clara response, for example, source 3 Nixon in 1968 and Clinton both had 43 percent plurality of popular votes, but the electoral votes gave them a more accurate result of 301 Nixon and 370 Clinton.

Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. Seeking help from a classmate that's in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier.

In conclusion , working with groups it's more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and I was completely lost on the civil war.                          . It's a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. Sometimes teachers doesn't know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. When my teacher assigns group it's way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so I can understand better and get to do the work. At times I dont even get to turn in my assignment when it's due. For example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. For example I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. They can also get a lot of work done by working in groups.

Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. Benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

When discussing why teachers should let any student participate in school sports or activities, it is important to consider the potential benefits students may gain from their involvement. Many students with lower grades may benefit from developing essential skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and self-confidence. It is also important to remember that lower grades do not always reflect a student’s true skills or level of competency. Participating in activities can also give students an outlet to engage in social activities, make friends, and stay active.

In order to help students with lower grades be successful in such activities, it is important for teachers to provide support and create an environment that encourages student success. Once students are set with reasonable expectations and resources, they can be provided with the opportunity to develop and grow their skills in a safe, supportive environment. This could include scheduling extra study time with the student before they participate in the activity, creating individualized learning strategies, and connecting the student with a mentor who can work with them.

In the first Paragraph, the author says that Veuns is often referres to as Earth's twin. Venus is the the closest planet to earth distnace wise. Also the density and size are very similar. Since the sun orbits at different speed sometimes we are closer to mars and other time we are closer to venus. Venus is sometimes right around the corner. Since somethimes it is the closes plane towards us humans have sent numerous spacecraft to land on Venus. Meaning we can gather more information on it.

Venus may have once been the most Earth-like planet in the solar system. Many years ago, Venus was probably covered with oceans and could have supported various form of life. Today Venus still has features that are analogous to those on earth. The author states the plante has a rocky sediment and familiar features such as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus can be our nearest option for planetary visit.

Lastly, facing the challenges presented by Venus has a important value. Human curiosity will most likely lead us into many equally intimdating endeavors.

Doing homework at home has its own advantages and disadvantages.

After school activities offer advantages such as providing an engaging environment with a sense of camaraderie, fostering the development of important social skills, and enhancing physical health. However, after school activities can also have disadvantages. Additionally, students in after school activities often benefit from close relationships with mentors and coaches and have the potential to be part of a team. Additionally, the lack of peer interactions and motivation in an unstructured setting can lead to a student becoming easily distracted..

3991,"Everyday when you wake up and get ready for work there's always one thing you use, it's inched it's way into your daily life and now you wouldn't be able to do most things without it. It's your four wheeled friend that sits out in your driveway or garage, your car. Every day millions of people drive miles and miles in a car, using them to go to work or to go and see other people, but what people don't understand is the need to limit just how much they use their automobile companions.

Cars have changed our lives for the better and for the worse. They save us a tremendous amount of time by making traveling super efficient, but along with that is air pollution. Cars emit greenhouse gasses, and these gasses trap heat which in then leads to warming of the surface of the earth. This warming of the earth creates drastic changes in many environments such as the polar regions. ""Passenger cars are responsible for twelve percent of greenhouse gas emmisions in europe... and up to fifty percent in some car intensive areas"" This was stated in an article about German suburb life witout cars. By limiting the amount of which we drive and by switching to alternative sources for transportation we can lower the amount of greenhouse gases and stop the heating of the earth.

Furthermore, these gases create smog. Smog is similar to fog but instead it has gases emitted from cars in it. Smog is usually thick and can be hazardous to environments. It was so bad in Paris that they set a partial driving ban in which people couldn't not drive becuase they didn't want the smog to get worse. The problem here is that people still continued to drive out even though there was a ban being inforce. So, this is another issue in which cutting back on car uses can fix. If we switch to biking to places that are withing biking distance or walking to place that are walking distance than we wouldn't have to worry about smog, or bans.

Automobiles have changed the way we live our lives and the way we do things, but they also have changed our communities. The typical city today consists of tall buildings and a surplus of streets and avenues, but parks are not as common. In Bogota there has been celebrating a day without cars for three years, and it has seen changes in the community. By having everyon give up their car for a day it can change their view on things, can make them notice things about the place in which they live in that they did't know about before. It can show them the beauty of their surroundings and this can lead to people wanting to protect that beauty and improve their city. This can be done in the form of building parks, and fixing uneven sidewalks.

So all in all, we depend on cars for daily purposes and it may seem hard to let go of your keys and walk, but if we all do that every once in a while it can lead to tremendous benefits. Imagine if you could walk outside and see people walking and enjoying themselves, not having to worry about gas prices or traffic jams. Imagine if we didn't have to worry about greenhouse gases or smog. Going for walk instead of driving may not seem like much, but it has major impacts on a multitude of things.",,0.0

Hey, guys! Today we're gonna talk about student-mentor programs and how they're super helpful for both mentors and mentees. Like, I know some people might be thinking, ""Why do we need mentor programs? Can't we just, like, figure things out on our own?"" But trust me, having a mentor can make a huge difference in your life.

First, mentors are like, super cool people who have been around for a while and know a lot of stuff. They can teach you stuff that you might not learn in class, like how to manage your time, how to study for tests, and how to be responsible. And they're not just like, ""Hey, do this, and you'll be fine."" They actually take the time to listen to you and help you figure things out. Like, my mentor last year helped me with my math homework and stuff, and I was so grateful.

But it's not just about the academic stuff. Mentor programs can also help you develop important life skills, like communication, problem-solving, and teamwork. Like, imagine being able to work on a project with someone who's been around for a while and can give you advice and support. It's like, so much better than trying to figure things out on your own.

And guess what? These skills are super important in jobs too! Employers are always looking for people who can work well with others, communicate clearly, and solve problems. So even if you're not planning on becoming a math teacher or anything, having a mentor can still help you succeed in life.

Now, I know some people might be thinking, ""But what about the mentees? What do they get out of it?"" Well, let me tell you, being a mentee is just as important as being a mentor! You get to learn from someone who's been around for a while and can teach you new things. And you also get to develop those important life skills that I was talking about earlier.

Seven hours in school all day can be overworking and stressful, kids need something that they can depend on to relieve all that added stress. Weather its sports, clubs, social activities, etc. students need something that isn't them sitting in a room all day competing to keep their grades up. I think that students should have to be endorsed into doing extracurricular activities because, it can force them to go out and do something other than just sitting there on there phones all day. It teaches them social skills and gets them out of there comfort zone, and by doing this it pushes them to get out of their immediate circle of friends and meet new people.

Making students chose an extracurricular activity increases their chances of getting successful jobs in the future. It teaches them to adapt and change to new environments. In the workplace most jobs will require them to interact with new faces all the time. Fun extracurricular activities just better equips them for that. It also boosts students confidence levels up by making them put themselves out there more than they normally would. Students need the opportunity to get out of their comfort levels and try new things, and after school clubs do just that.

If they were to only stay within their comfort zone they would only be hurting themselves more. They will never get to experience all the trials and errors of trying different things. Who knows they might just discover a new-found love or hobby for something that they never would have even thought of before. By stepping out of their house and just trying they are already doing the hardest part.

School is exhausting, you're working for hours on end repeating the same lessons over and over doing the same boring thing every day. How could this not affect the mental health of students? They need something to take there mind off of everything. Something to relieve them of all the pilled up stress they have been lifting. After school clubs and sports can not only improve their mental and physical health, but it can lift the burden off there shoulders for a moment of the day. It can be a place away from all of their hassle of school work and tests. Mandated extracurricular activities keep kids sane, they are exactly what stressed kids need to get a break from everything.

I strongly agree that making students participate in an extracurricular activity is a great idea. It boosts their social skills and forces them to push themselves and go out beyond what they would normally do. They may not even know it yet but many of these clubs and sports can actually teach them very valuable lessons and tips that can help them for the future. It also gives them something useful to do rather than just watching TV all night. For many kids this can give them something to be a part of, it makes them feel like they belong to something.

People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life. I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that failure plays an important role for some people in life, If they fail once they could get it right the second time and succeed. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesn't happened in the future.

Here is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the name's for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time.

Overall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. People will learn from their mistakes and it will take time for people to be successful in their life and accepted that they failed for the first time.

Its very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time.

People that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or don't fail.

390852,"Some districts set low GPA requirements in order to open extracurriculars to larger numbers of students. 
After researching how other school districts handle the Grade Point Average (GPA) requirements for extracurriculars, it is clear that district policies vary significantly. Doing so allows the school to maximize the benefit of extracurriculars while still encouraging students to remain academically successful. 

Lower GPA requirements open extracurriculars to more students, enabling them to benefit from the positive activities and social interactions these activities provide. Keeping such a balance is important to ensure that students have the best educational experiences, and are able to make the most of their learning opportunities.. There are benefits to each approach. Other districts set higher GPA requirements in order to ensure that students remain academically successful. At the same time, too low of a requirement can be counterproductive, as students may end up focusing more on extracurriculars than academics. 

Higher GPA requirements provide an incentive to remain academically focused, while ensuring only students that are doing well in school are participating in extracurriculars. 

Weighing these pros and cons, it seems that the school should strive to keep its current GPA policy not too high or too low. However, setting such high requirements can limit the number of students who are able to participate and deny them the opportunity to benefit from extracurriculars",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

667687,"Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much. i want people to see it not hear.

Some students already know what career they want to take. For example, I have 3 careers I'm thinking about but can not choose one. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. If Generic_Name can leave AFROTC her scheduled for the next school year can change. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in.

One reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen.

For all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. If they don't have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. Students taking their time for choosing careers is good for them and will help them choose the right career for them.. This can help the students in many ways. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. They can take a break and think very well about their options. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. For example, my friend Generic_Name is in AFROTC, she has been in AFROTC for 3 years. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. I have 1 year to think about which one. Some students don't have an idea of what career they want to take when they enter high school. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college.

Another reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they don't know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. They don't have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her.

870059,"Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions.

Therefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Although some say ""Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself ""I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way.""

Some say if ""You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow."" How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it!

Others say that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong. People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off.

In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard.                         . You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you ""You can do it."" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. Furthermore, some child think better if one person gives them an idea. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. We can work and have fun, also working with a team is great because we can talk not just about the project, but our lives. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what I'm thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. It means that working with a group is a great benefit, it help us to have better thoughts.

Working with a group can bring joy to our soul by making new friends. We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you don't want to do any homework. Moreover, a group work can make learning more passionate.

In conclusion, working alone is beneficial because it can save our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because all the group can share information and that can bring a faster work. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we don't need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. That day my group and I talked where to see each other, then we went to Generic_Name's house. Although some say working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information and work fast.

Some say that working alone is beneficial because we don't waste our time. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun. All I can say, we all just waste our time.

However, working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information. Thank you for taking your time to read my paper, I hope you understand why I prefer working with a group.. Working alone doesn't help in answering doubt that we could have.

941115,". He wrote, ""Diligence is the mother of good luck."" To him, hard work meant taking control of one's life and seizing every opportunity to make progress.

Indeed, history is marked by examples of those who achieved greatness due to their dedication and hard work. Hard work prepares one for self-sufficiency, be it financially, occupationally, or practically. From scientists like Albert Einstein, to explorers like Captain James Cook, their success was driven by their commitment to their goals despite all the obstacles in their way.

Hard work and intelligence are often two sides of the same coin when it comes to success. Hard work gains credibility, respect and trust, all things needed to achieve stability. Hard work can help make sacrifices and inconvenience worthwhile, as it can lead to long-term progress. While intelligence helps steer one down the right path, hard work is the vehicle that propels one forward. The old adage ""where there's a will there's a way"" rings true – hard work ensures that little stands in the way of achieving one's ambitions.

Yet, with proper planning and communication, these issues can be minimized. As demonstrated, group work can be much more beneficial than working alone and should be the preferred method for completing projects or tasks.. 

Furthermore, collaborating with peers on a project or task helps us stay organized and on task. Plus, we are able to keep up with the progress of our peers, which adds a layer of accountability to each member of the group.

Despite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.

To sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. 
Working in a group can be incredibly beneficial compared to working alone. Group work allows us to gain knowledge from our peers, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with unique and creative solutions.

But currently cars are starting to cause a lot of problems to people such as: car accidents, pollution, and just leaving areas to crowd. One of the main problems that cars globally cause is smog emission which is caused by the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions and can cause difficulty in breathing, lung cancer and rampant air pollution. However, in other parts of the world people are limiting car usage to almost banning them all out completely in certain areas in order to be more environmentally friendly and reducing air pollution. By limiting car usage in America people can benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.

In North America, pollution has been a major problem for citizens in many ways. Besides power plants, the second main source of pollution are cars, as they release harmful chemicals and gases like smog which can cause congestion and when too much and inhaled on a daily basis, can lead to lung cancer. By limiting car usage people can benefit more to the people; for example in Paris, France a partial driving ban was enforced in order to clear the air of smog after days of near record pollution. By doing this congestion was brought down by 60 percent helping to majorly clear the air and make breathing better for people.

In Vauban, Germany residents of the area have been called suburban pioneers due to giving up their cars. By doing this people were able to be more happy and enjoy life more. For example, ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" this aids the argument that by banning or limiting car usage people are able to be much calmer and benefit more. In Bogotá, Colombia during ""Carefree day"" for the first time two Colombian cities joined Bogotá in this unique event. There more parks and sports centers for people were placed, the sidewalk were smooth and more business and commercial areas were opened up for people. This further shows that people can benefit greatly without having cars.

Throughout the world wherever cars have been limited or banned there has always been one constant, new alternative transportation. In China in order to help reduce the absurd amount of smog and air pollution, Chinese citizens resorted to using bikes leading to a drop in smog levels. By limiting cars and replacing them with alternative transportation people can be much safer from more dangerous situations, such as car accidents hurting people, keeping dunk drivers away from the steering wheel, and being able to save more money from not buying a car. Though some alternate vehicles are not fast enough for example bikes, this has been remedied in some areas by allowing free public transit from buses and taxi services.

Throughout all of these benefits people can benefit more greatly, but that's not enough. In 2012 during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Bill Ford proposed a business plan in where partnering with the telecommunication industry to create cities where ""pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."""" The End of Car Culture"" by Elisabeth Rosenthal. Through bright ideas like the advantages of limiting cars can be fully realized and brought to life in order to help and save more people from negative aftereffects. In America if people were to cut down on car use people could benefit from less pollution, a more positive community impact and alternative vehicles in place of cars.  ",,0.0

To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online

People think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health. Technology is taking over the world! There is now less human contact. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves. In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it can possibly impact their health in a horrible way and people get too dependent on technology, but they use it to help themselves.. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it impacts their health in a negative way and people get too dependent on technology.

Health is very important, but people take good health for granted; To begin with, technology may impact individuals health in a negative way. This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
436763,"We can lose precious time that could be spent on more important tasks or even relaxation activities such as going for a walk, reading a book or listening to music. Mental health researchers now suggest heavy use of technology can lead to a range of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. 

Fourthly, technology can make us lazy. Apps such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat have the potential to keep us on our devices for hours, without us even realising it. We no longer have to leave our homes for entertainment, we can just access that online instead. Here are five reasons why I disagree with the increased use of technology in my life. 
With the increasing use of technology in our lives, many of us are becoming increasingly disconnected from our physical and emotional worlds. We can fall into the trap of clicking on malicious links or downloading software from false sources, leaving our personal information exposed and vulnerable.

It is clear why I disagree with the increased use of technology in my life. By shutting out reality and replacing it with the digital one, we neglect our need for meaningful human interaction and emotional attachment.

Thirdly, technology can be a huge distraction from tasks we need to complete. 

Firstly, I believe it's important to keep a balance between technological and natural elements of life. For example, a recent outing to the beach with family has highlighted the beauty of our natural environment and the importance of connecting with the physical world.

Secondly, the heavy reliance on technology can be detrimental to our mental health. Too much time spent with screens and devices will lead us to miss out on important connections and experiences found in the real world, such as interactions with nature, conversations with our peers, and simply the joy of physical play outside. 

Finally, misuse of technology could potentially lead to cybercrime or other forms of digital fraud. In order to live a balanced and fulfilling life, we must be mindful of the amount of time we spend interacting with technology and taking it away from other activities.. Eventually this can lead to a decrease in physical fitness, leading to further health issues. Instead of walking to the local store or post office, we can just order what we need online. We now spend our days staring at screens, tapping away on devices and skimming through digital content, rather than engaging with the world around us",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
21077,"Fame comes with both advantages and disadvantages, and one of the most common disadvantages is the lack of privacy. Some people argue that famous people should be given more privacy and that the media should not be so intrusive, while others argue that this is the price of their fame. I disagree with the latter perspective and believe that famous people should be given more privacy.

First of all, famous people are still human and have the same right to privacy as everyone else. They should not be treated differently just because they are in the public eye. The media should respect their basic right to privacy and not intrude on their personal lives. For example, paparazzi should not be allowed to follow them around and take pictures of them without their consent. 

Furthermore, the media can be too intrusive and sensationalize stories about famous people. This can lead to unfair and inaccurate portrayals of famous people and can be damaging to their reputation. For example, some tabloids have been known to publish false stories about celebrities, which can lead to public humiliation and distress. 

Finally, famous people should be given more privacy because it can help them to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Constant media scrutiny can be overwhelming and can lead to burnout. It is important for famous people to have some time away from the public eye so that they can relax and recharge. 

In conclusion, I believe that famous people should be given more privacy. They have the same right to privacy as everyone else and should not be treated differently just because they are in the public eye. Furthermore, the media can be too intrusive and sensationalize stories about famous people, which can lead to unfair and inaccurate portrayals.

We would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. People can stop being lazy and do their work. They can ask for help if they need it. Although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. Learning new stuffs is hard but if its a good idea people should do it.

I think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lifes. I think it does because it helps us learn on what to do. Getting to know new people by doing things.

If your not doing things you won't get anything accomplish in life. It can help by not getting to one an other. If they ask they would have a lot accomplish.. Although it may take time to get use to it they would have experience at the end. For example, if you don't do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job. We can teach other the same way as well.

We have other people helping us in different ways. For example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. For example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something.

481558,"We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.

In conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.

Parents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.

One of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.

The government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.

The prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.

Having a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

566690,"Firstly, providing an extended school day would take away from time students otherwise would spend on after-school activities, such as club meetings or sports practices. 

These are just a few of the reasons why the school should not add one and a half more hours to the school day. For instance, a student who is on the school's football team would have to decide between sacrificing time spent developing their team skills or risk sacrificing their academic pursuits. Therefore, I strongly urge the school against extending the school day.. As the school day length increases, so do the workloads for teachers, making it harder for them to focus on their students. During an extended school day, students would be less alert and less likely to absorb what they are taught, reducing the quality of their education. 

Secondly, this extra hour and a half would also put a strain on our already stretched teachers and staff. It is important to take student's health, well-being, and education into account when determining what is best for the school. 

When considering whether to add one and a half more hours to the school day, several important factors must be taken into account. Additionally, due to the lack of time for other pursuits such as research, the pay might become too poor to attract new teachers and staff.

Finally, this longer school day would leave students tired and unable to learn as effectively as they would when properly rested",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0

Secondly, by expanding our repertoire of abilities, it opens up more opportunities for advancement or career changes, meaning our future prospects are increased. Going beyond our limits instils courage and resolve in us and helps us to move forward into our future with more purpose and resilience.. For instance, if someone has a passion for counselling, they may find that their experience in business could help them to secure the role. 
The renowned essayist and poet Ralph Waldo Emerson perhaps best summed up the importance of pushing ourselves beyond our boundaries with his quote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already done"". Not only can our careers be boosted, but we also gain a greater understanding of our capabilities and resources. For example, if someone has traditionally worked in finance, they might find that they enjoy and have an aptitude for sales or marketing. This sentiment resonates deeply with many of us, as it draws attention to our potential for growth. Taking on a challenge or exploring a new area can help us to trust in our abilities and be more confident in difficult situations.

53496,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during break. During the summer most students forget what they learned during the previous school year from all the fun they had over the summer,so teachers give out the summer project to keep all the knowledge in their brain. The summer projects are usually teacher designed and most students dont do them strikingly because they have so many rules and arent able to show their own way of what they learned. schools should let the summer project be student designed because they will have different ways to show or express what they learned,student project should actually be done and teachers will be able to see what is store for them during the school year.

Students summer reading projects is something they do during the summer, to show what they remember from the previous school year. They are able to express their work in different forms like poster boards, art designs , power points and etc. However if the teacher designed the summer project there will be specific rules on the way the teacher wants the project to look. Students are able to make fantasy boards and put or draw about their project There are so many different ways to show what has been learned over the summer or even during the school year.

the teachers designs arent all ways fun .Most projects will look the same which makes the day they showcase exhausting from seeing the same thing over and over again.

Projects should be exciting and informative for classmates. Teachers are able to see different and new techniques they can use during class. More than half the class wouldnt participate with the project if the teachers would've designed the project. Teachers can put some input to help the students design the project but not a lot to where it seems like the teachers is taking over their project. Students also wouldnt have done it because summer is there break away from all school work and teachers. For example my sophomore year of high school we had to do a summer project but it was call ""summer reading project"" it was mainly for English and it was really boring and overwhelming. There was a list that you had go choose a book from , graph organizers we had to do; and even questions we had to fill out . It was like three pages long and the books was long. Spent most of my summer reading the book barley was able to go anywhere with my friends nor family. The summer reading project wasnt even fun ,when it was time for me to do it i always got upset because i knew i was about to be bored and lonely. Students design would make the projects fun and not overwhelming.

In result of a student not doing their project would be the teacher not being able to see what they remember or know from last school year. The student is also getting a bad grade from not doing the assignment. Teachers are able to see the way the students learn. They are able to see how students will handle projects that will be assigned during the school year. there showcase on the first day of school should be informative for the classmates and teachers. Everyone should be able to show what they learned and their talent at the same time. Students want class to have more Estaing like the summer but not as much. Students dont want no boring projects over the summer where they are suppose to be having fun and out of school. Teachers should take that in to reality to because they want to have fun over the summer too.

Teachers give out the summer project to keep all the knowledge in their students brain. Summer is fun so, why not let the project be fun for the students. Students should be able to connect and relate to there project and not be bored and not wanting to do it . Schools should let the summer project be student designed because they will have different ways to show what they learned , students project will actually be done , and teachers will be able to see whats in store for them during the school year. ",,0.0
971784,"That's the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job.

The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they don't get stressed out too much. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. That's the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they don't get stressed out too much.

Some people would disagree with me because they think it's ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. Also if you need help don't hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. Also, so they don't get too stressed out for it.

If you know what you want to do then you're fine because the more you know the less stress you'll be in. On september 2, 2015 Generic_Name was entering his first year of high school, and already knew what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what kind of doctor he wanted to be. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school.

The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. If you know what you want to do then you'll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you won't have to take extra classes for no reason. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. The more you ask for help the less you'll be stressed. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, don't even have a plan, and would just be stressed out.

In conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school.             ",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0

459822,"Determine Never to be Idle: A Lesson from Thomas Jefferson

As an 8th grader, I find myself constantly balancing schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and personal interests. It can be EASA to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of daily life and let time slip away without achieving anything meaningful. That's whey I find Thomas Jefferson's quote, ""Determine never to be idle,"" to be particularly inspiring. According to Jefferson, being idle is not only a waste of time but also a missed opportunity to make a positive impact on the world.

So, how can we apply this quote to our own lives? One was is to prioritize our time and focus on activities that are meaningful and productive. For example, instead of spending hours scrolling through social media or watching TV, we could use that time to read a book, learn a new skill, or volunteer in our community. Ba being intentional with our time, we can make the most of every moment and achieve our goals.

One example of someone who used their time effectively instead of being idle is Malala Yousafzai, the young Pakistani activist for female education. Malala was shot BA the Taliban for speaking out against their ban on girls' education, but instead of letting this setback deter her, she continued to advocate for education and became a global leader in the fight for girls' rights. Through her determination and hard work, Malala has inspired millions of people around the world to stand up for their rights and make a positive impact.

On the other hand, people who are idle and think that inactivity serves a purpose are not determined or planning for the future. Ba not using their time wisely, Thea are missing out on opportunities to learn, grow, and make a difference. Idleness can lead to a sense of stagnation and dissatisfaction, as we feel like we are not achieving our full potential. In contrast, those who are determined and proactive are more likely to find fulfillment and success in their lives.

In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson's quote ""Determine never to be idle"" is a powerful reminder to use our time wisely and make the most of every moment. Ba being intentional with our time and focusing on activities",,1.0
186442,"Dear state senator,

I urge you to vote in favor of changing to election by popular vote to select the President of the United States. I urge this to pass for three particular reasons. First is because of the factor that electors could defy the will of the people or the peoples word, Second is because of the event of a would already be handed over to the House of Representatives, and third is because of the winner takes all system.

To begin with the electors have and most likely will again defy the will of the people and the peoples word. For example, In The source The indefensible Electoral College: Why Even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong. By: Bradford Plume, He states that back in 1960 segregationists in the Lousing legislature nearly succeeded in replacing the Democratic electors with new electors who opposed president J.F.K. Likewise electors have occasionally refused to vote for their party's candidate and vote for who ever they want.

Next, is the most worrying, the prospect of a tie in the votes of the Electoral College. If this were to happen the election would be decided by the House of Representatives where the state delegations would vote on the president. Since each state only has one vote a representative from Wyoming representing 500,000 wouldn't have as much say as the reps. From California who represent near 35 million people. In 1976 a tie would have occurred if 5,559 voters in Ohio and 3,687 voters in Hawaii had voted for the other side, only a few voters away from catastrophe.

And Finally, The Electoral College is unfair to voters because of the winner takes all system. In each state candidates don't spend time in states that they know they have no chance of winning. They focus most of their time in the swing states. During the 2000 campaign seventeen States didn't see the candidates at all including Rhode Island and Southern California. Voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't get to see a single ad. If anyone has a good argument to put their fate in presidency in the hands of a bunch of swing voters in Ohio, they are far away from the White House.

And once again state senator I urge your vote towards changing to election by popular vote to select the President of the United States. Because First, is the factor that electors could defy the will of the people or the peoples word, Second is because of the event of a tie it would already be handed over to the House of Representatives, and third is because of the unfair winner takes all system.

792899,"Some student's may need time to do homework, go places that take a long time, or just make up time to study. Making them stress out over knowing that they would have to wake up early and be dismissed late.

Third, the education time of some student's may be cut short. First, student would not concentrate in school if they got out an hour and a half late. This may happen when some student's are in a sport or they just need to leave school early. If schools were to add more time the students would not get enough sleep because they stayed up late studying for a quiz, test, or just homework causing the students or the other classmates to sleep during classes

Second, it would affect the mental health of the students. Student's who participate in a sport may have to leave class early to go practice for an up coming game making them miss half and hour or more of education.

What is your opinion?                      . Do you think school's should extend the school hours? Well, I disagree",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
976482,"Several studies have shown that, when used in moderation, cell phones can be an effective tool for teaching certain academic topics. 
Cell phones have been increasingly recognized as an important teaching tool in the classroom. Teachers should also make sure there is an understanding amongst students that cell phone use is intended for academic purposes and not for recreational activities such as social media or texting friends. Allowing students to use cell phones sparingly, for specific academic tasks, can ensure they stay focused on their studies. To better understand the potential benefits and drawbacks of allowing students to use cell phones in the classroom, it is important to look at recent research in this area. By enforcing clear policies and enforcing consequences, cell phone use in the classroom can become a beneficial tool for educators and students alike.. On the other hand, cell phone use in the classroom can also be seen as a distraction, as constantly checking messages and social media can be distracting for both students and teachers.

To address this issue, it is essential for teachers to set some ground rules from the start. For example, the use of quick response (QR) codes to access educational materials has been found to improve student engagement and comprehension of material",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
481201,"This might be the hundredth letter opened about this electoral college topic, but this is a very important subject that needs to be run by all of our citizens. Honestly the electoral college is very important because after elections after everyone has voted they are the ones that are the electors for the President and the Vice President. It's not like it was made for no reason it was made to make the elections fair, it's not like it's the first time people have wanted to let abolish the Electoral College even many people have wanted to remove this like for example Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Bob Dole, and more but this dost mean that it is the right choice. Yes it is agreed that there are some downs to have the Electoral College, plus even the person that the Electoral College votes for that might not be the person most of the nation choose. Like now in the 2012 elections Obama had more Electoral votes than Romney""Because almost all states award the electoral votes on a winner takes all basis."" So yes that is why the electoral college shouldn't be removed.

But the Electoral College also have rules in this article by Richard Poster ""The Electoral College requires a presidential candidate to have no transitional appeal. No region has enough electoral votes to elect President."" Like think about it if one of the BIL states for example lets say Texas wants to vote for candidate, but two smaller states want to vote for another candidate, but they don't have enough votes to compete with that one BIL state then the Miller states would always in the elections and that dost make the elections fair like the should be and that just makes it worse that ""it is"" now because with the electoral college it makes the voting fair because they can see what all the states want, and they can choose who is right for the position. People might have other opinions and that is completely fine but at the end of the day a division has to made, and it would be best if it was the best decision for the people band made.

Now back to what the downsides are of the electoral college ""The single best argument against the electoral college what we might call the disaster factor."" a part of Bradford Plume's article ""The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best laid defenses of the system are wrong."" Even just in the name of that article explains everything that event he ""best"" type of system can be a disaster, and the entire article cannot be quoted but hopefully with that one quote the point will let across to the people. Everyone should read some sources before making a division like this. Not just the people voting so that even the people not voting will fully understand why one division is band made and why one isn't band made. This one thing can affect the way electing president will be from now on to the future, unless they decide they want to change it alien.

All in all one letter will not change everyone's opinion, but it seems like the people who want to remove the electoral college are anachronism instead of the electoral college themself it seems like they want to remove them so that the winner take all system will be better on there half so that the running candidate can appeal to the Miller states and win most of their votes."" Voters in presidential elections are people who want to expresses a political preference rather than people who think that a single vote may decide an election."" There is other more that can be said but the reason why this letter was written in the first place, to keep the electoral college.  ",,0.0
350756,"For students, this extra time could be used for enrichment activities such as tutoring, clubs, and elective courses. Ultimately, extending the school day by one and a half hours could be an invaluable asset for both students and teachers.. For teachers, this additional time could be used to provide professional development and mentorship opportunities, giving them the chance to further develop their skills and share knowledge with their colleagues. This could provide them with the opportunity to explore and develop interests outside of the traditional curriculum. 
Extending the school day by one and a half hours could provide numerous benefits for both students and teachers alike",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,1.0
608493,"the first reason is because a lot of student's maybe think that a C average it good. and, also they will be proud of there self's. So. For various reason's i think that student's should have at least a B average to be able to participate in sports or other activities. So, then they could focus more in school and, get good average's.

The second reason is that parent's would also be happy for there children to have good grade's and, that they could participate in school activities. But , for many other student's a B is a better average then, a C.

Also, i think that it would be a better reason for the student's because a lot of student's want to participate in sports or other activities",huggingface.co_human_ai_generated_text,0.0
